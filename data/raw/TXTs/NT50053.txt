Reduction of discount rate (Items 1 and 2). The Secretary 
reported that advice had been received of action by the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Kansas City, and Dallas establishing a rate of 4 per cent (rather than 
4-1/2 per cent) on discounts for and advances to member banks under 
sections 13 and 13a of the Federal Reserve Act and a rate of 4-1/2 per 
cent on advances to member banks under section 10(b), subject to review 
and determination by the Board of Governors. The directors of the 
Cleveland Bank had established a rate of 5-1/2 per cent on advances to 
individuals, partnerships, and corporations other than member banks 
under the last paragraph of section 13, while the directors of the 
other Reserve Banks mentioned had established a rate of 5 per cent on 
such advances.

The Secretary noted that the Board of Directors of the Boston 
Reserve Bank had established on March 27, 1967, a rate of 4-1/4 per 
cent on discounts for and advances to member banks under sections 13 
and 13a, but that on April 5 the Bank's Executive Committee had estab-
lished a rate of 4 per cent. The Executive Committee of the Atlanta 
Bank had established a rate of 4-1/4 per cent on March 30, and no sub-
sequent action had been taken by the directors of that Bank. 
The Secretary further noted that the directors of at least three 
other Reserve Banks (New York, Chicago, and San Francisco) were meeting 
today and presumably advice would be received later this afternoon with 
regard to the rates established by the directors of those Banks. 
Chairman Martin observed that the account given by the Secretary 
indicated the likelihood that before the close of business today the 
directors of at least nine Federal Reserve Banks would have established 
a discount rate of 4 per cent. The Chairman expressed the view that 
the Board of Governors should act at this time on the matter and that 
the only problem seemed to relate to the establishment of a 4-1/4 per 
cent rate by the directors of the Atlanta Bank. One course of action 
would be simply not to act at this time on the rate established by the 
Atlanta Bank, or he could get in touch with President Patterson or First 
Vice President Kimbrel and inquire as to the Atlanta Bank's preference. 
In his view the Board should not attempt to direct the directors of the 
Atlanta Bank to establish a rate of 4 per cent. 

1310

Governor Maisel expressed the view that such an attempt would 
not be worth while, and Governor Robertson agreed. Governor Daane 
observed that the directors of the Atlanta Bank might want to establish 
a rate of 4 per cent if the total situation was explained to them. In 
any event, even if the 4-1/4 per cent rate should be approved by the 
Board of Governors, the Atlanta Bank would almost certainly have to 
move to 4 per cent within a short time. 
Chairman Martin noted that the Atlanta Bank might prefer that 
the Board of Governors not act at this time on the 4-1/4 per cent rate. 
Governor Maisel inquired whether the Board could not act on 
the rates to be established by the New York, Chicago, and San Francisco 
Reserve Banks on the assumption that advice would be received that those 
Banks had established a 4 per cent rate. 
Mr. Sherman pointed out that frequently the Board had acted to 
approve a certain discount rate for Reserve Banks whose directors had 
advised of the establishment of such rate and also for any other Reserve 
Banks that might subsequently advise the Board of establishment of the 
same rate. 
With reference to the Atlanta situation, Governor Mitchell 
expressed the view that the Board should not approve the 4-1/4 per cent 
rate until the Reserve Bank's directors had an opportunity to know of 
the total situation as it had developed. 
Chairman Martin suggested that he could advise the Reserve 
Bank's management of the situation by telephone and indicate that the 

1311 
4/6/67 
-10-
Board of Governors would defer action on the established 4-1/4 per cent 
rate if the Atlanta Bank preferred. 
Governor Maisel said that he would be willing to approve the 
4-1/4 per cent rate if the Atlanta Bank reiterated its desire for such 
action. 
Governor Shepardson noted that it was not known with certainty 
what rates would be established by the directors of the New York, 
Chicago, and San Francisco Banks, and Governor Robertson suggested that 
the Board's action could be in terms of approving the 4 per cent rates 
that had been established and authorizing the Secretary to advise the 
Reserve Banks concerned of the Board's approval of the same rate for 
any other Banks that might establish such rate. This would mean that 
if any Reserve Banks advised of the establishment of a rate other than 
4 per cent, consideration of the action to be taken by the Board of 
Governors would be deferred for another meeting of the Board. 
Governor Daane suggested that the Secretary might be authorized 
to communicate by telephone with the management of any Reserve Banks 
that might advise of the establishment of a rate other than 4 per cent, 
informing them of the total picture and inquiring whether they wished 
to have such rates acted upon by the Board or held over without action. 
Governor Brimmer said that he would be reluctant to approve a 
4-1/4 per cent rate for any Reserve Bank. It was quite obvious at this 
stage that the majority of the Banks were coming in at 4 per cent, and 

1312 
4/6/67 
-10-
if Banks came in at 4-1/4 per cent he would prefer that action be 
deferred pending consideration by the Board of Governors at another 
meeting. This would be consistent with the suggestion that the Secre-
tary communicate with the management of any Banks whose directors estab-
lished a rate other than 4 per cent and describe the total picture as 
it had developed. Governor Brimmer reiterated that he would not be 
willing to approve at this time a rate of 4-1/4 per cent for any Reserve 
Bank. 
Governor Maisel said that he would be willing to approve a rate 
of 4 per cent for any Banks that had established such rate and that he 
would also be willing to authorize the Secretary to advise of Board 
approval for any Banks that subsequently came in at 4 per cent or even 
at 4-1/4 per cent, provided the latter were informed of the total situa-
tion and reiterated their desire to establish the 4-1/4 per cent rate. 
Governor Mitchell suggested that a decision on action to be 
taken on the establishment of a 4-1/4 per cent rate be deferred, at 
least until tomorrow, for further consideration by the Board. He had 
particularly in mind the possibility that the San Francisco Reserve 
Bank might establish a 4-1/4 per cent rate. He would be reluctant to 
see a rate approved for the San Francisco Bank that was different from 
the rate approved for the majority of the other Reserve Banks. 
Chairman Martin expressed the view that the Board should be 
careful about seeming to set the discount rate for any Reserve Bank if 

1 3 1 3 
4/6/67 
-10-
that could be avoided. He thought that was an important consideration 
to bear in mind from the standpoint of System organization. 
Governor Daane observed that a 4-1/4 per cent rate, if approved 
for one or two Reserve Banks, would not be viable very long. He would 
be inclined, he said, to approve a 4-1/4 per cent rate if the desire to 
establish it was reiterated by the Bank or Banks concerned, with the 
realization that it could hardly be maintained indefinitely. Then the 
Board of Governors would not be in the position of seeming to direct 
Reserve Banks as to what particular rate should be established. 
Governor Maisel pointed out that if the 4-1/4 per cent rate was 
not approved the current 4-1/2 per cent rate would automatically con-
tinue in effect for the Reserve Banks concerned. 
Governor Brimmer commented, in that regard, that if the rate of 
certain Reserve Banks remained at 4-1/2 per cent after a rate of 4 per 
cent had been announced for several Reserve Banks, the market would 
conclude simply that the remaining Banks would establish the 4 per cent 
rate in due course. Accordingly, he would be willing to see some Banks 
remain temporarily at 4-1/2 per cent. However, he would be reluctant 
to announce that a 4-1/4 per cent rate had been approved for any Banks. 
After further discussion along such lines Chairman Martin pro-
posed that the Board act today to approve a rate of 4 per cent for those 
Banks whose directors had advised the Board of the establishment of such 
rate, and for other Banks whose directors subsequently established the 

1314 
4/6/67 
-10-
same rate. If some Reserve Banks advised of the establishment of a 
4-1/4 per cent rate, action would be deferred pending further Board 
discussion. 
Governor Robertson suggested that the deferral of such discus-
sion be until some time next week. While he would have no strong feel-
ing against announcing today the approval of mixed 4 and 4-1/4 per cent 
rates, he believed that a subsequent announcement of approval of a 
4-1/4 per cent rate might be misinterpreted. 
The Board then approved unanimously, effective April 7, 1967, 
the establishment by the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas of 
a rate of 4 per cent on discounts for and advances to member banks under 
sections 13 and 13a of the Federal Reserve Act, along with the secondary 
rates that had been established by the directors of those Banks. 
The Board also authorized the Secretary to advise any other 
Reserve Banks concerned of Board approval of action taken by the direc-
tors of such Banks to establish a rate of 4 per cent on discounts for 
and advances to member banks under sections 13 and 13a, along with 
appropriately corresponding secondary rates. 
There was read a draft of press release proposed to be issued 
at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST today announcing the Board's approval of 
action taken by the directors of the Reserve Banks which by that time 
had advised of the establishment of a discount rate of 4 per cent. The 
issuance of the proposed press release was approved unanimously. 

1315 
4/6/67 
-10-
In response to a question by the Secretary, the Board confirmed 
that if advice should be received that the directors of any Reserve Bank 
had established a discount rate of 4-1/4 per cent or had reestablished 
a discount rate of 4-1/2 per cent, those advices should be held without 
action pending further consideration by the Board. 
Mr. Molony inquired whether the press release might state specif-
ically that the Board's vote approving the 4 per cent discount rate was 
unanimous. Governor Robertson raised a question whether the Board should 
get into a situation where its press releases would announce the vote 
each time, and Mr. Molony observed that the effective date of the Freedom 
of Information Act (July 4, 1967) was rather close at hand. Governor 
Robertson then commented that he regarded that as sufficient reason to 
announce the unanimity of the action on this occasion. Chairman Martin 
remarked that he believed that would also be desirable in this instance 
from a policy standpoint. 
Secretary's Notes: Subsequent to this meeting, 
but before the Board's press release was issued, 
advice was received that the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco had established, 
subject to review and determination by the Board 
of Governors, rates of 4 per cent on discounts 
for and advances to member banks under sec-
tions 13 and 13a and 4-1/2 per cent on advances 
under section 10(b). The directors of the 
Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Banks 
had established a rate of 5 per cent on advances 
to individuals, partnerships, and corporations 
other than member banks under the last para-
graph of section 13, while the directors of the 
New York Bank had established a rate of 5-1/2 
per cent for such advances. Accordingly, the 

10 
4/6/67 
-10-
Board's press release reflected approval of 
the 4 per cent rate for such Banks, and those 
Banks were advised by telegram of approval of 
the rates that had been established by their 
directors. 
On April 7, 1967, the Atlanta Bank advised 
that the Executive Committee of its Board of 
Directors had established, subject to review 
and determination by the Board of Governors, 
rates of 4 per cent on discounts for and 
advances to member banks under sections 13 
and 13a of the Federal Reserve Act, 4-1/2 per 
cent on advances under section 10(b), and 6 per 
cent on advances under the last paragraph of 
section 13. Pursuant to the authority given 
by the Board of Governors, the Secretary 
advised the Atlanta Bank of approval of such 
rates effective April 10, 1967, and an appro-
priate press release was issued. 
On April 13, 1967, the St. Louis Bank advised 
that its Board of Directors had established, 
subject to review and determination by the 
Board of Governors, rates of 4 per cent on 
discounts for and advances to member banks 
under sections 13 and 13a, 4-1/2 per cent on 
advances under section 10(b), and 5 per cent 
on advances under the last paragraph of sec-
tion 13. Pursuant to the authority given by 
the Board of Governors, the Secretary advised 
the St. Louis Bank of approval of such rates 
effective April 14, 1967, and an appropriate 
press release was issued. 
A copy of the notice published in the Federal 
Register concerning the discount rates approved 
by the Board of Governors is attached as Item 
No. 1. A copy of the press release issued by 
the Board at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST on 
April 6, 1967, is attached as Item No. 2. 
Conference of Central Bank Governors. The Board authorized 
travel, with reimbursement on an actual expense basis, by three staff 

1317 
4/6/67 
-10-
members (Robert Solomon, Robert L. Sammons, and Lyle Gramley) to attend, 
as advisers, the fourth annual Conference of Central Bank Governors of 
the Western Hemisphere to be held at Mont Gabriel, Quebec, Canada, 
May 27-28, 1967, with the understanding that they might also attend, 
as observers, the succeeding two-day meeting of the Governors of the 
Latin American Central Banks. 
Secretary's Note: There was sent today 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago a 
letter advising that the Board's letter 
of March 1, 1967, approving the payment 
of salaries to 158 employees of the 
Reserve Bank at rates above grade max-
imums should be considered as approving 
in principle the payment of above-maximum 
salaries to all employees concerned. The 
Reserve Bank had advised that there were 
189, rather than 158, employees whose 
salaries were above grade maximums as 
the result of the authorized general pay 
increase and also that such increase 
became effective March 6, 1967, rather 
than February 20, 1967, as originally 
contemplated. 
The meeting then adjourned.

For immediate release. 
April 6, 1967« 
Item No. 2 
4/6/67 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
unanimously approved today actions by the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, reducing 
the discount rates of those banks from 4-1/2 to 4 per cent, effective 
Friday, April 7, 1967. 
The discount rate is the interest rate charged member 
banks on borrowings from their district Federal Reserve Banks. The 
change in the rate is the first since December 1965, when the rate 
was increased from 4 to 4-1/2 per cent. 
The reduction approved today is in line with recent 
declines in market rates and in keeping with the Federal Reserve's 
policy objectives of assuring that the availability of credit is 
adequate to provide for orderly economic growth.
