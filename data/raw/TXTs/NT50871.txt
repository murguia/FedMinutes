Industrial National Corporation. 
In a memorandum dated January 11, 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of 
the application of Industrial National Corporation, Providence, Rhode 
Island, to acquire shares of Ambassador Factors Corporation, New York, New 
York. 
The Banking Markets Section, in a memorandum dated January 17, com-
mented on the characteristics of the factoring industry and summarized re-
lated issues. : ( 
At Governor Mitchell's suggestion there was a general discussion 
of the factoring industry. 
Of the 26 active, large factors competing in 
national markets, 14 operated as divisions or affiliates of commercial 
banks or holding companies. 
The trend of acquisition of factors by com-
mercial banks seemed likely to continue, and might result in banks or bank 
holding companies controlling all but the largest independent factors. 
An 
important reason for the trend was better access to capital through such 
affiliation; smaller factoring companies were especially vulnerable to 
the difficulties of raising capital. 
Other comments dealt 
with possible economies of scale in the larger 
fa ctoring companies, the return on equity, and the extent to which factor-
ing markets were national. A question was raised whether by allowing 
acquisition of factoring companies by bank holding companies the Board 
might be fostering greater respectability for an industry that had been 
considered "unclean" in some quarters, in that a business was not likely 
to factor its receivables unless its own condition was weak. 
Responses 
Indicated that many clients of factoring companies were merely too small 

85 
1/18/72 
-4-
to handle their receivables directly and did not have access to credit 
sources available to larger businesses. 
Discussion of public interest implications included an expres-
sion by Governor Maisel that, since the factoring industry had capital 
Problems, it would appear to be in the public interest to allow bank 
holding companies to solve those problems, so long as competition was 
not thereby decreased. A larger number of combinations of bank holding 
companies and factoring companies should improve rather than decrease 
competition. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the application of Indus-
trial National Corporation was approved, Governor Brimmer dissenting 
because he thought further study should be given to the factoring in-
dustry. 
It was understood that an order reflecting this decision would 
be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Civil rights. The Board approved unanimously a letter to the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development commenting on proposed Fair 
Housing poster requirements. A copy of the letter is attached as 
Item No. 6. 
Investment adviser services by bank holding companies. With a 
memorandum of January 14, 1972, the Legal Division provided documen-
tation in support of its recommendation that Regulation Y, Bank Holding 
Companies, be amended to permit bank holding companies to serve as in-
vestment advisers to investment companies, and that an interpretation

1 9 7 1 . 
Discussion at today's meeting centered principally upon the 
functions of an investment adviser and the distinction between open-end 
and closed-end investment companies from the standpoint of issuing 
securities. 
The Legal Division was of the opinion that the Glass-Steagall 
Act prohibited interlocking directorates between a bank and an open-end 
fund, which continuously offered its securities, and the Board's inter-
pretations had adhered to that view. However, the Board had also held 
that banks could have interlocking directorates with a closed-end fund, 
which was not engaged in continuous underwriting. 
Other aspects of the 
di scussion dealt with procedural questions. 
It was understood that the proposal would be given further con-
sideration in the near future. 
All members of the staff then withdrew except Messrs. Holland 
and Burke. 
Officer salaries. 
The Board discussed recommendations made by 
the Executive Director in two memoranda dated January 18, 1972, for 
certain officer staff salary increases, promotions to officer status, 
and title changes. Mr. Holland described the methodology used to compile 
the recommendations. 

87 
1/18/72

Discussion centered upon two issues of officer staff adminis-
tration: 
(1) the organizational theory that is being and should be 
applied to the officer group; and (2) the desirability of providing a 
mechanism that would give members of the Board an opportunity to evaluate 
officer staff performance and to have such evaluation taken into account 
in actions on officer salaries and titles. 
Governor Sheehan was requested to study the first question, in 
consultation with Messrs. Holland and Burke, and to report to the Board at 
a suitable time. The Board also requested Messrs. Holland and Burke to 
devise a mechanism to accomplish the purposes of the second question, 
and to withold further processing of the officer salary package pending 
further discussions with the Board. 
The meeting then recessed and reconvened in the Board Room at 
2:00 p.m., with all Board members present and the following staff members

Discount rates. 
On January 13 and 17, 1972, the Board had dis-
cussed proposed changes in discount rates. On January 6 the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and St. Louis had established, 
subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, rates of 
4-1/4 and 4 per cent, respectively, rather than the present 4-1/2 per cent, 
°n advances and discounts for member banks under section 13 and 13a of the 
Federal Reserve Act. Related changes in subsidiary rates were also estab-
lished. The St. Louis Reserve Bank renewed its proposal on January 13.

would be desirable to give some indication to the market place that the 
Federal Reserve felt that, in view of the state of the economy and the 
behavior of the monetary aggregates, some small further easing would be 
helpful. However, that attitude had already been clearly signaled by 
reductions in the discount rate in November and December, by a reduction 
in margin requirements a few weeks ago, and by open market operations that 
had led to a significant addition to reserves. 
Governor Mitchell said he was agreeable to refraining from action, 
although his position was narrowly balanced. 
It seemed to him that busi-
nessmen, especially those with small-scale operations, were prone to 
over-read the signifiance of a discount rate change, whereas bankers were 
influenced more by the basic money rate structure. 
Governor Daane commented that he felt even more strongly than 
during preceding discussions that international considerations weighed 
against a decrease in the discount rate. He believed that the posture of 
the Federal Reserve should be one of easing and supporting the economy, 
not only in image but in substance, but that attitude was already being 
evidenced through open market operations, and he did not think that a 
small change in the discount rate would affect that posture. 
Governor Maisel stated that he was marginally in favor of a re-
a c t i o n , but he did not feel strongly because the staff had estimated 
that short-term interest rates were too low to hold for long. One possi-
ble advantage in a reduction would be to move more banks to cut the prime 

90 
1/18/72 
-9-
rate. 
if a decrease was not approved, he would prefer not to act rather 
than to dissapprove. 
Governor Brimmer stated that while he had earlier leaned toward 
a reduction, international circumstances and the prospect of rising 
short-term rates in the months ahead put him now marginally on the nega-
tive side. 
Governor Sheehan spoke in favor of retaining the present discount 
rate. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that the wisest course 
would be to reduce the rate, although the situation was not clear cut. 
He thought that a reduction might delay any tendency for short-term rates 
to move up later. He recognized, however, that the budget, with its 
large deficit, would promote inflationary expectations. He did not weigh 
international influences as heavily as other members of the Board, but 
thought the decision should rest on the condition of the domestic economy. 
The discussion then turned to procedural choices, during which a 
majority view emerged in favor of informing the two Reserve Banks involved 
by telephone that the Board was disinclined to approve the proposed rate 
changes, with the principal reasons for that position. Governor Brimmer, 
however, preferred that action be taken to disapprove. 
The establishment without change on January 13, 1972, by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis

and Dallas of the rates on advances and discounts in their existing 
schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding that appro-
priate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
It was also understood that all Federal Reserve Bank Presidents 
would be informed by coded wire that the Board planned no early action 
with respect to the proposed discount rate reductions. 
The meeting then adjourned.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
SOCIETY CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, a bank holding company 
^ t h i n the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for 
t h ® Board
1s prior approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842 
<
a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent (less directors' qualifying shares) 
o f the voting shares of The 1st State Bank & Trust Company, Columbus, 
°Mo ("Bank") • 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
a ccordance with § 3(b) of the A c t , and the time for filing comments 
a n c* views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
a l 1 comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
o f the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant controls 11 banks with aggregate deposits of approxi-
mately $1,147 million, representing 5.2 per cent of the total commercial 
b a i*k deposits in Ohio and is the fifth largest banking organization in 
t h e State. 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1971, and reflect hold-
l n 8 company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board through • 
M e m b e r 30, 1971.) Consummation of the acquisition of Bank ($19 million 
d ePosits) would add less than .1 per cent to Applicant's percentage share 
0 f ^ p o s i t s and would not change its rank. 
Though Bank is the ninth largest of 40 banking organizations 
the Columbus area, it controls less than 1 per cent of the area deposits. 

93 
-2-
APplicant's acquisition of Bank would constitute its initial entry 
*
n the Columbus area. Applicant's nearest subsidiary to Bank is 
Seated over 25 miles away, and there is little existing competition 
between this subsidiary or any other of Applicant's subsidiaries and 
Bank. Moreover, due to the distances involved and Ohio's branching law, 
and other facts of record, there appears to be only a slight possibility 
0 f 
s ubstantial potential competition developing between any of Appli-
cant
l8 subsidiaries, or Applicant itself and Bank. On the other hand, 
APPlicant's acquisition of Bank should make the latter a stronger 
competitor in the Columbus area, which is dominated by three large 
hiding companies. On the basis of the record before it, the Board 
c°nsiders that consummation of the proposal would not adversely affect 
^ p e t i t i o n in any relevant area. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
Applicant, its subsidiaries, and Bank appear to be satisfactory and 
C o r*3igtent with approval of the application. Considerations relating 
t o 
the convenience and needs of the community to be served lend some 
^ i g h t toward approval of the application, since Applicant proposes to 
e*Pand Bank'8 trust services; to provide participation lending arrange-
ments; a n (j t o institute a credit card program. 
It is the Board's judg-
nt that the proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and 
**at the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
Reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
the

U ) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order 
0 r (b) later than three months after the date of this Order, unless 
such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
THE AUGLAIZE COUNTY BANK 
Order Approving Application for Merger of Banks 
The Auglaize County Bank, St. Marys, Ohio, which is to be 
a Member State bank of the Federal Reserve System, has applied for 
tlle Board's approval pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 
l 8 28(c)) of the merger of that bank with The Home Banking 
C°tnpany, St. Marys, Ohio. As an incident to the merger, the 
p r e 3 e n t offices of The Home Banking Company would become branches 
0 f 
Auglaize County Bank. 
As required by the Act, notice of the proposed merger, 
i n form approved by the Board, has been published, and the Board 
requested reports on competitive factors from the Attorney 
G*neral, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit 
X nsurance Corporation. 
The Board has considered the application and all comments 
a t l d reports received in the light of the factors set forth in the 
A c t > and finds that: 
Applicant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Central Bancorporation, 
I n c'» a registered bank holding company. The proposed merger is one step 
i n a Plan of corporate reorganization whereby Central Bancorporation, Inc. 
j 
8 t o acquire all of the capital stock of The Home Banking Company. 
Central 
^ c o r p o r a t i o n has already received approval of the Board under the Bank 
Elding Company Act to acquire The Home Banking Company (36 Federal Register 
18034). 

-2-
96 
The proposed merger of The Home Banking Company and Applicant, 
a nonoperating bank formed solely to facilitate the corporate reorgani-
2ation described above, would itself have no effect on competition or 
°
n banking convenience and needs. The financial and managerial resources 
an<i prospects of The Home Banking Company are satisfactory, as they will 
with respect to the resulting bank. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the application should 
b e approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
t b e reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order 
°
r (b) later than three months after the date of this Order, unless such 
p eriod is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
aPproves the application of The Auglaize County Bank, St. Marys, 
°hio, for stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, sub-
ject to the numbered conditions hereinafter set forth. 
1. 
Such bank at all times shall conduct its business 
and exercise its powers with due regard to the 
safety of its depositors, and, except with the 
permission of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, such bank shall not cause or permit 
any change to be made in the general character of 
its business or in the scope of the corporate powers 
exercised by it at the time of admission to membership. 
2. 
The net capital and surplus funds of such bank 
shall be adequate in relation to the character and 
condition of its assets and to its deposit liabilities 
and other corporate responsibilities. 
The Board has approved the application on the under-
standing that The Auglaize County Bank will not conduct a banking 
business with the public until it has merged with The Home Banking 
Company, St. Marys, Ohio. 
In connection with the foregoing conditions of member-
s h i p , particular attention is called to the provisions of the 
Board's Regulation H, regarding membership of State banking 
institutions in the Federal Reserve System, with especial reference 
t o Section 208.7 thereof. A copy of the regulation is enclosed. 

t- n f^m 
M r . Oliver W . Birckhead

If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's 
charter is made, the bank should advise the Federal Reserve Bank, 
furnishing copies of any documents involved, in order that it may 
he determined whether such change affects in any way the bank's 
status as a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
Acceptance of the conditions of membership contained in 
this letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the board 
of directors after the bank has appropriate State authorization to 
commence business. A certified copy of such resolution should be 
transmitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. 
The-time within which admission to membership in the 
Federal Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished 
is limited to 60 days from the date of this letter, unless the bank 
applies to the Board and obtains an extension'of time. When the 
Board is advised that all of the requirements have been complied 
with and that the appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock 
has been issued to the bank, the Board will forward to the bank a 
formal certificate of membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
Very truly yours,

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
MERCANTILE BANC OR PORATION INC.. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Mercantile Bancorporation Inc., St. Louis, Missouri, a 
b a n k holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company 
A c t , has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act 
U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire up to 100 per cent of the voting 
shares of County Bank of S t . Charles, S t . Charles, Missouri ("Bank"). 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
a n c i views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
a l 1 comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
o f the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant, the largest banking organization and largest 
bank holding company in Missouri on the basis of deposits, has five 
S ubsidiary banks with aggregate deposits of $1.12 billion, representing 
9 « 
Per cent of the total commercial bank deposits in the State. 
(All 
banking data are as of June 30, 1971, adjusted to reflect holding company 
acquisj.tions and formations approved by the Board through November 30, 
3 , 9 7 1 •) Consummation of the proposal herein would increase Applicant's 
o L 
r e of commercial bank deposits in the State by less than .1 per-
C e t*tag e point. 
Bank ($9.7 million of deposits) is one of the smaller banks 
°
P e r a t i n g in the S t . Louis banking market, and is the smallest of four 
b anks i n Bank's primary service area, which is approximated by S t . 

-2-
100 
Charles and the immediate surrounding area. The St. Charles area 
has enjoyed substantial population growth in the past, and the 
Prospects for the area's economic growth appear highly favorable. 
t^o of Applicant's subsidiary banks, including its lead bank ($966 
million deposits), are located in downtown St, Louis approximately 
23 
miles from Bank. While there appears to be some competition between 
Bank and Applicant's subsidiaries in the S t . Louis area, or some 
Potential therefor, consummation of the proposed acquisition is not 
likely to substantially lessen competition nor to have any significant 
e ffect on competition in any relevant area. In light of the facts 
o f record, notably the large number of banks in the St. Louis banking 
Market (over 100), the existence of geographical barriers and the dis-
tance separating Applicant's subsidiaries and Bank, and Missouri's 
restrictive branching laws, there seems to be little prospect for 
^ e development of significant competition between Bank and Applicant's 
S ubsidiaries. Furthermore, consummation of the proposal herein is 
n°t likely to have any adverse effects on Bank's competitors nor would 
l t raise any significant barriers to entry by others into the area; 
rather it would enable Bank to compete more effectively with the 
larger banks in its service area. 
The financial and managerial resources and prospects of 
Applicant, its subsidiaries, and Bank are all regarded as satisfactory 
*
n d consistent with approval of the application. Applicant proposes 
t o assist Bank in enlarging its mortgage lending services and in 

-2-
101 
e stablishing additional services such as trust and bond services. 
addition and expansion of such services should enhance Bank's 
ability to meet the expanding needs of its service area. 
Thus, 
considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the corn-

The Honorable Samuel J . Simmons 
Assistant Secretary for Equal Opportunity 
Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Washington, D.C. 
20410 
Dear M r . Simmons: 
At the meeting in Governor Brimmer's office on December 13, 
the matter of the proposed Fair Housing poster requirements that were 
published for comment by HUD on August 4, 1971 (36 F.R. 14336), was 
discussed. You stated you would appreciate comments from the Federal 
Reserve although the time for comments had expired. 
Our basic concern is that, although the regulations would 
apply to financial institutions such as banks and savings and loan 
associations, they are directed primarily to real estate owners, 
agents and management companies. For example, the poster to be^ 
required would contain a listing of seven illegal actions pertaining 
to sale, rental or financing of housing. 
However, only the sixtn on 
the list—to deny or offer different terms or conditions in making 
residential real estate loans—is applicable to banks and savings 
and loan associations. 
It seems inappropriate to us to require 
^ 
financial institutions, which are generally restricted from engaging 
in sale or rental activities, to display a poster containing language 
that is clearly not applicable to them. 
Since the intent of the Poster 
insofar as it pertains to financial institutions, is to increase public 
awareness of the nondiscrimination requirements of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1968 pertaining to real estate financing, we feel that the 
effect will be dissipated in the confusion of the other language. 
The Board believes that the joint financial agency statement 
on advertising and poster standards that was published on December 1/ 
(a copy of the Board's press release is enclosed for your convenient 
reference) will provide the separate treatment for banks and savings 
and loan associations that is desirable. Accordingly, the Board 

104 
M r . Samuel J . Simmons 
suggests that you consider revising the August 14 proposal to except 
banks and savings and loan associations that are subject to super-
vision by the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, or this agency. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith
