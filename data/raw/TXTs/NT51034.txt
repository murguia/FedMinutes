The Board unanimously approved, for transmittal to the Comptrol-
ler of the Currency, a report on the competitive factors involved in the 
Proposed merger of The Stockwell State Bank, Stockwell, Indiana, into 
Purdue National Bank of Lafayette, Lafayette, Indiana. The conclusion 
read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of The Stockwell State 
Bank into Purdue National Bank of Lafayette, Lafayette, Indiana, 
would eliminate little existing or potential competition. 
How-
ever, it would increase slightly the share of deposits presently 
held by Purdue National, the largest in the market. Overall, the 
effect of the proposal on competition would be slightly adverse.

Street Bank, Arlington, Virginia, to merge with The Bank of Arlington, 
Arlington, Virginia, and authorized issuance of an order reflecting 
that decision. A copy of the order is attached as Item No. 2.

Barnett Banks of Florida.

Foreign Direct Investment Regulations. 
In a memorandum dated 
March 9, 1973, Governor Brimmer described a Federal district court deci-
S l
°
a o f
 March 2, 1973, that created uncertainty about the validity of 
the. Foreign Direct Investment Regulations. 
Initial press reports conveyed 
the> 
impression that the entire program administered by the Office of 
l o r e
i g n Direct Investments was destined to be scrapped. Governor Brimmer 
e
l
t
 that OFDI would welcome an expression of the Board's interest in 
rapid resolution of the uncertainties over the applicability of the 
For 
e i
g n Direct Investment Regulations and recommended that a letter be 
q 
to OFDI; a draft was attached to his memorandum.

After discussion the Board approved the letter to OFDI with 
suggested changes. A copy of the letter in the form transmitted is 
attached as Item No. 12. 
Income and condition report schedules. At the meeting on 
January 9, 1973, the Board approved a recommendation with respect to 
public disclosure of (1) the annual report of income, including sched-
ules, and (2) schedules printed on the reverse side of the quarterly 
report of condition filed by State member banks. The Board decided 
that it would not make information in the report of condition schedules 
available until after consultation with the other Federal bank super-
visory agencies. 
In a memorandum of March 13, 1973, Mr. Veenstra of the Division 
Data Processing outlined the proposed report disclosure procedures 
announcement by the three supervisory agencies. The Comptroller and 
the FDIC were planning to release an unedited version of the report of 
condition schedules, and the Board an edited version. 
After discussion the Board agreed that it would release the 
edited version; that it would not make a public announcement until 
details had been worked out; and that the present charge schedule of 
ten cents per page would be followed pending review of the costs 
E v o l v e d , 
It was also understood that although the Board would not 
Negotiate with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the 
Comptroller of the Currency on the edited version of the condition

report schedules, Governor Mitchell would talk with Chairman Wille 
and Comptroller Camp to see if they could be persuaded to also come 
out with an edited version now or at the next call date. The Board 
also agreed that State member banks would not be notified of requests 
for their reports. 
Testimony on NOW accounts. Governor Mitchell reported on a 
conversation with Congressman St Germain, Chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Bank Supervision and Insurance of the House Banking and Currency 
Committee, who had requested that Governor Mitchell testify on the 
implications of interest-bearing accounts from which funds may be 
withdrawn by executing negotiable orders of withdrawal. These "NOW 
accounts" were currently being offered by savings banks in Massachusetts 
and New Hampshire. Governor Mitchell indicated that Congressman St Germain 
w
as not insistent that he testify after learning that the Board was 
unable to develop a definitive proposal on NOW accounts prior to the 
time set for the hearing. 
Grandfather rights. Pursuant to the Board's action on January 4, 
a determination was issued today regarding the status under the 
grandfather provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of Chicago City 
fi
ancorporation, 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois. A copy of the determination 
i s
 attached as Item No. 13. 
The meeting then adjourned.

the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)).

BanCorp, a recently organized company, with no operations or 
subsidiaries, was formed for the purpose of acquiring shares of National 
($12,4 million in deposits) and of State Bank ($16.3 million in 
d e
Posits) from Jackman.~ 
At the present time, Banks are under common 
c
°ntrol, share the same president, and are located in the same building 
W i t
b a common lobby. Banks complement each other's services; individ-
U a l l
y » neither is a full service bank. 
State Bank was formed in 1912 by 
t h e
 management of National Bank (established in 1855). Both banks have 
b e e n
 controlled by the Jackman family for four generations. 
BanCorp would control the third and fifth largest among the 
S 1 k b a
n k s in Janesville; and the sixth and eighth largest among the 18 
Rock County, the relevant banking market. 
In combination, 
B a n k s
, with 22 per cent of deposits, represent the smallest of the three 
b a n
k i n g organizations in Janesville; within Rock County, BanCorp would 
c
°
n
trol 9.4 per cent of deposits and would be the fifth largest of 
banking organizations competing in that market. 
It appears that the 
P U t
P o s e of the proposed transaction is to effect a transfer from a 
P
*
r t
nership form of ownership of Banks to corporate ownership by BanCorp, 
t h
® t the transaction is a reorganization with no significant 
consequences. Approval of the transaction probably will

rapidly developing northeast part of Janesville, with the result that 
a n
 additional full service banking institution would be serving the rele-
n t market. 
In view of the long-term and present noncompetitive re-
lationship between Banks, it appears that consummation of the proposed 
transaction will not increase concentration nor eliminate any existing 
between Banks. 
In view of the unlikelihood that Banks 
Present ties will be severed in the near future, the prospect of potential 
competition 
developing between Banks seems remote. 
Establishment of an 
^dependent bank close to the location to which BanCorp proposes to move 
/Oj. 
tate) Bank has been proposed; the chances of State approval of the pro-
Posed new charter may be impaired by the relocation of one of Banks. 
On 
t
*
l i s b
a s i s , relocation may have some adverse effects on potential com-
petition. However, the Board concludes, based on the facts of record, 
t h a t
 consummation of the proposed acquisition would not significantly 
f f e c t
 competition adversely in any relevant area. 
Upon consummation the partnership which presently controls 
B a t
iks wiix continue to control Banks through control of BanCorp.

a t
*cial condition, managerial resources, and prospects of BanCorp will

Banks' financial condition

Additionally,

tela

a
tion if such capital is deemed necessary. 
Considerations relating 
t l l G
 convenience and needs of the community to be served weigh in

 result in there being two full service banks to serve the market in 
the one combined operation. 
Approval would enable management to

fect a relocation without the risk that the holders of minority inter-
e S t s

 one bank might be favored over the minority shareholders of the

It is the Board's judgment that the

C o t
Pus Christi Bank is to be merged has no significance except as a means

as the proposed acquisition of the shares of Bank,

of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and

Applicant is a newly-formed organization and has no operating

ing organization and seventh largest bank holding company in Texas, and 
w
ould control $537 million in deposits, representing 1.8 per cent of State-

Corpus Christi Bank ($179.2 million in deposits) is the largest

kank holding company in T e x a s — F i r s t City Bancorporation, Inc., H o u s t o n — 
applied to acquire the second largest bank in Corpus Christi, with 
A _ 
Per cent of market deposits. The closest other proposed subsidiary 
b
^nk is San Antonio Bank, located 145 miles northwest of Corpus Christi. 
A u s
t i n Bank ($177.2 million in deposits) is the third largest of 13 banks

It appears that consummation of the proposal would not have an 
adverse effect on existing competition inasmuch as each proposed banking 
subsidiary is located in a separate banking market, the closest of which 
are 80 miles apart. Deposit concentration in the markets would not be 
altered, and Statewide concentration would increase by only 1.8 per c e n t . 
Approval of the application would not impede the future entry of outside 
bank holding companies nor inhibit the creation of additional bank hold-
l n
8 companies in the markets involved. Approval would create a banking 
organization of sufficient size to compete effectively in the respective 
markets for the wholesale banking business which has been going to the 
larger banking organizations headquartered outside the markets. 
Com-
petitive considerations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources 
prospects as they relate to Applicant and the three proposed subsidiary 
b
anks are consistent with approval, in view of Applicant's commitment to 
cct additional capital into Austin Bank within six months after consum-
mation, The major banking needs of the respective markets appear to be 
a d e
q u a t e l y served at the present time. However, the demand for more 
s
°Phisticated 
banking services has grown as the southeastern part of 
^exas, in which Banks are located, has developed. However, it has been 
n o t
 the local bai\l<lt\$» oxgnniBatJoiis but- rather the larger banking 

_ 303 
-4-
institutions headquartered in Dallas and Houston that have been provid-
ing such services. Approval would enable Applicant to better meet the 
need for the new and expanding services and allow it to better compete 
in the communities in which it operates, and these considerations lend 
height toward approval. 
It is the Board
f
s judgment that the proposed 
a c
quisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
t G
asons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a)

Such activities have been

Notice of the application., affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views on the public 
M e r e s t factors, has been duly published (37 Federal Register 24852).

Applicant controls one bank-^ with deposits of approximately 
$198.2 million, repr&sting 4.7 per cent of the commercial bank deposits 
in the S t e Louis m a r k e t . U 
Although Applicant's banking subsidiary 
A l g i n a t e s and services mortgage loans for its own portfolio, its 
share of total mortgage loans in that market is less than one per cent. 
Company operates from a single office in St. A n n , Missouri, 
vrtiere it is engaged in originating and servicing mortgage loans in 
St. Louis m a r k e t . 
In 1971, Company originated $10,9 million in 
mortgage loans for sale to investors and $2.3 million in construction 
l o
a n s for its own account. The combined share of total mortgage

igir.ation3 in the S t . Louis market by Applicant and Company 
i s
 substantially less than 2 per cent of the total mortgage recordings

 that m a r k e t . With a mortgage servicing volume of $127.5 million, 
C
°topan.y i s t h e fourth largest mortgage company headquartered in S t . 
l o u

companies with offices in the S t . Louis m a r k e t . 
In view of the 
Relatively large number of other mortgage lenders in the m a r k e t , 
l u n a t i o n of this small amount of local competition w o u l d , in the

P a i

Public benefits outweigh any possible adverse effect on competition. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations reflected

 the record, the Board has determined that the balance of the public 
interest factors the Board is required to consider under § 4(c)(8)

FIRST BANCORP,

Order Granting Approval of Acquisition of Bank 
First Bancorp, 
Inc., Corsicana, Texas, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842 ( a)(3)), to acquire the successor by merger to Citizens National 
B a
nk in Ennis, Ennis, Texas ("Bank"). The successor bank to Bank 
h a
s no significance except as a means to facilitate the acquisition 
°f voting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition is 
Seated herein as a proposed acquisition of the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance 
w i t
h § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has 
e
*Pired, and none have been timely received. The Board has considered 
t h e
 application in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the 
A c t
 (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant owns 24.7 per cent of Bank and, in addition, 
c
°tttrols one bank, First National Bank of Corsicana, with deposits 
0 f
 $41.7 million, representing less than one-half of 1 per cent of 
deposits of commercial banks in Texas.!/ 
Acquisition of Bank 
(d 
e
Posits of $16.8 million) would not significantly increase the con-
j u r a t i o n of banking resources in Texas. 
T 7 — All banking data are as of June 30, 1972.

There is little substantial existing competition between 
Applicant's banking subsidiary and Bank since they are located in 
different though adjacent banking markets and due to the fact of 
Applicant's substantial ownership interest in Bank. This latter 
factor also militates against the probability of future substantial 
competition developing between Applicant and Bank. The Board 
concludes that competitive considerations are consistent with approval 
o f
 the application. 
The financial condition, managerial resources, and future 
Prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary bank, and Bank appear satis-
factory, particularly in view of the fact that approval of this 
a
Pplication will result in increased capital for Bank. These factors 
support for approval of the application. Considerations relating 
t o
 the convenience and needs of the communities to be served lend 
s
ome weight for support of approval of the application, since Applicant 
Plans to provide greater management depth and certain specialized 
financial services, such as factoring and personal property leasing, 
w
hich Bank does not presently offer. 
It is the Board's judgment 
t
^
a t
 consummation of the proposed acquisition would be in the public 
int-
Merest and that the application should be approved.

BARNETT BANKS OF FLORIDA, INC. 
Order Denying Acquisition of Bank 
Barnett Banks of Florida, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
a
Pplied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C 
l
842)a)(3)) to acquire 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of 
Peninsula State Bank, Tampa, Florida ("Peninsula Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired 
a n d
 the Board has considered the application and all comments received 
i n
 light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C 
l 8
*2(c)). 
Applicant controls 37 banks with aggregate deposits of 
billion, representing 6.6 per cent of the deposits of commercial 
banks in Florida and is the second largest banking organization in 
t h
e State, 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1972, and reflect 
^ank holding company formations and acquisitions approved through 
J a
nuary 31, 1973.) 
The acquisition of Peninsula Bank, which has 
t o t
a l deposits of $38.2 million, would increase Applicant's control 
State deposits by .2 percentage points, and its rank among State 
anking organizations would not change. 

y ± i 
-3-
Peninsula Bank controls 3.4 per cent of the commercial deposits 
in the Tampa banking market as the second largest of the 10 remaining in-
dependent banks. The acquisition of Peninsula Bank would represent Appli-
cant's third entry into this market. Applicant's larger market subsidiary, 
Harnett Bank of Tampa, Tampa, Florida ("Tampa Bank"), located four miles 
northeast of Peninsula Bank, controls deposits of $16.6 million, repre-
senting 1.5 per cent of total market deposits. Applicant's other market 
b a
n k , Barnett Bank of 
Brandon, N*A., opened in October 1972 and is 
located 16 miles to the east in Brandon, Florida. Applicant also has 
t V o
 subsidiaries located approximately 20 miles from Tampa in Clearwater 
a n d
 St. Petersburg. 
The record indicates that approximately 75 per cent 
the deposits and 22 per cent of the loans of Peninsula Bank are 
derived from the service area of Tampa Bank, and that approximately 
17 
4
 per cent of the deposits and 22 per cent of the loans of Tampa Bank 
are derived from Peninsula Bank's service area. The Board concludes 
t
^at substantial existing competition would be eliminated by consum-
p t i o n of this proposal. 
The Tampa banking market encompasses the City of Tampa and 
*
t s
 suburbs in Hillsborough County where 25 banks presently compete 
eight of the State's 25 multi-bank holding companies are repre-
8 e
nted. 
The market is highly concentrated; the three largest holding 
c
°mpanies control 69 per cent of market deposits. Applicant's acqui-
s
ition of subject bank would remove one of the remaining independent 

banks, located close to the downtown Tampa area, which could serve as a 
Possible means of entry by a banking organization not presently repre-
sented in the market. 
It is the Board's judgment, based on this record, 
that area competition would be adversely affected by consummation of 
the proposed acquisition. 
Not only would substantial existing corn-
Petition be eliminated and potential competition foreclosed, but a 
m e
dium for deconcentrating the Tampa market would also be eliminated. 
Pursuant to the Act, the Board is required to deny this application 
based on its adverse competitive findings unless there are benefits 
a c
cruing to the public which would prevail over and outweigh the 
A v e r s e features cited above. 
The financial condition of Applicant and its subsidiary 
b a
nks appears to be generally satisfactory, especially in view of 
Applicant's commitment to improve the capital position of its 
subsidiaries. Management for Applicant's group is also generally 
satisfactory and prospects for Applicant and its system of banks 
a
Ppear favorable. The financial condition and managerial resources 
Peninsula Bank are considered to be generally satisfactory and 
i t s
 prospects also appear favorable. 
Banking factors are 
c o n s i s t e n t

One reason for the Board's special interest in the attitude 
that may develop among the U.S. business and financial community over the 
impact of court proceedings against the Foreign Direct Investment Program 
l s
 the Board's constant awareness that the capital restraint program it 
administers on behalf of the Government is based on voluntary cooperation 
U.S. banks, U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, and U.S. 
jj°nbank financial institutions. 
So long as these U.S. financial institutions 
a v
e the impression that each of them is making an equally conscientious 
^ffort to observe the foreign lending restraints requested in the VFCR 
Adelines, and so long as the financial community believes that other U.S. 
l
JH'estors are sharing the burden of the restraints, the Federal Reserve 
tains a commendable degree of cooperation from institutions subject to 
.
 e
 VFCR. That essential cooperation could not be expected to continue 
j Participants in one of the programs were freed, for whatever reason, 
0:11
 their present responsibilities to limit their foreign financial activity.

In view of this situation, the Board would encourage your Office 
th
 
w
hatever steps are necessary to resolve, quickly, the uncertainty 
p
 a t
 appears to exist over the applicability of the Foreign Direct Investment

Item No. 13 
3/13/73 
CHICAGO CITY BANCORPORATION, INC. 
Determination Regarding "Grandfather" Privileges 
Under Bank Holding Company Act 
Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C, 1843) 
Provides certain privileges ("grandfather" privileges) with respect to 
n
°nbanking activities of a company that, by virtue of the 1970 Amendments 
t o
 the Bank Holding Company Act, became subject to the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act. Pursuant to § 4(a)(2) of the Act, a "company covered in 1970" 
®
a
y continue to engage, either directly or through a subsidiary, in non-
inking activities that such company was lawfully engaged in on June 30, 
1968 (or on a date subsequent to June 30, 1968, in the case of activities 
on as a result of the acquisition by such company or subsidiary, 
P
u
rsuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before June 30, 
^68, of another company engaged in such activities at the time of the 
ac
qviisition), and has been continuously engaged in since June 30, 1968 (or 
S u
ch subsequent date). 
Section 4(a)(2) of the Act provides, inter alia, that the Board 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System may terminate such grandfather 
A l l e g e s if, having due regard to the purposes of the Act, the Board 
^
6 t
ermines that such action is necessary to prevent an undue concentration 
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or 
U t l s
ound banking practices. With respect to a company that controls a bank 
With 
n
 assets in excess of $60 million on or after December 31, 1970, the 
°ard is required to make such a determination within a two year period.

Notice of the Board's proposed review of the grandfather 
Privileges of Chicago City Bancorporation, Inc., Chicago, Ilinois, 
and an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
v
iews or request a hearing, has been given (37 F.R. 22414). 
The 
time for filing comments, views, and requests has expired, and all 
those received have been considered by the Board in light of the 
f
actors set forth in § 4(a)(2) of the Act. 
On the evidence before it, the Board makes the following 
bindings. 
Chicago City Bancorporation, Inc. ("Registrant"), Chicago, 
Illinois, became a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, as a result 
o f
 the 1970 Amendments to the Act, by virtue of Registrant's ownership 
approximately 80 per cent of the voting shares of Chicago City Bank 
a n
d Trust Company ("Bank"), Chicago, Illinois (assets of approximately 
million, as of December 31, 1970). 
Bank, control of which was 
Squired by Registrant in January, 1968, had total deposits of $117 million 
a s
 of June 30, 1972, representing less than one-half of one per cent of 
thn 
aggregate deposits held by the 263 banking organizations located in 
^he Chicago banking market (approximated by Cook and DuPage Counties). 
On 
basis of deposits, Bank ranks 27th among the banking organizations 
*°
c
ated in the Chicago market. 
While the present financial condition andpprospects of Bank appear 
S a t
isfactory, the Board is concerned about Registrant's financial condition 
a j . 
. certain actions taken by Registrant's management that have the potential 
0 r
 impairing Bank's financial condition. Of particular concern is Regis-
ttfl i 
n t
 s relationship with Mayflower Investors, Inc. ("Mayflower"), Chicago, 

-5-
918 
Illinois. Mayflower became a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, 
by 
virtue of its 100 per cent ownership of Registrant. 
Mayflower, 
w
hose primary activity is the development and sale of land in Florida, 
has indicated its intent to cease to be a bank holding company prior 
to December 31, 1980, and states that it does not now own directly any 
shares of Registrant. 
Before said divestiture by Mayflower of ownership 
shares in Registrant, Mayflower caused Registrant to declare (1) a cash 
dividend that appears to have been financed by Registrant borrowing the 
n
ecessary funds and (2) a noncash dividend consisting of a 10-year interest 
hearing note. 
These dividends increased considerably the indebtedness of 
^
e
gistrant. 
Since Registrant's principal source of income is Bank, the 
debt servicing requirements of Registrant could result in an undesirably 
^ S h level of payout of Bank's earnings. 
The Board views with concern 
a n
V continued relationship between Registrant and Mayflower and urges the 
e
limination of any existing tie between said two organizations; and the 
^°ard intends to explore further Mayflower's dealings in stock of Registrant 
whether Mayflower has effectively terminated its control of Registrant. 
Registrant, which was organized in 1967 (assets of approximately 
million, as of December 31, 1971), does not engage directly in any 
a c
tivit v 
other than holding the stock of Bank and 100 per cent of the 
s
hares of Chicago City Investment Co. ("Chicago City"), Chicago, Illinois. 
Chicago City (assets of $364,000 as of December 31, 1971), which became a 
u
bsidiary of Registrant in January, 1968, engages in insurance agency 
and also owns less than 5 per cent of the outstanding voting 
c
es of each of a number of companies; and apparently has engaged in such 

919 
-A-
activities continuously since before June 30, 1968. 
Ownership of less 
than 5 per cent of the outstanding voting shares of a company is exempt, 
1/ 
under § 4(c)(6) 
of the Act, from the general prohibition in § 4 of the 
Act relating to the nonbanking activities of a bank holding company; and, 
°n that basis, no grandfather privileges are needed to enable Registrant 
t o
 continue such holdings and investments. 
Chicago City received 
insurance commissions of approximately $141,000 during 1971 as a result 
o f
 its insurance activities, which appear to be limited to the type of 
insurance activities on the Board's list of activities closely related to 
banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)). 
Registrant states that almost all of the 
Insurance sold is related to Bank's transactions. 
The facts before the 
^°ard show that the bulk of insurance commission income is attributable 
t o
 Physical damage insurance on automobiles—36 per cent of commissions; 
borne owner and fire insurance—20 per cent of commissions; mortgage life 
a n d
 accident and health insurance—23 per cent of commissions; and credit 
lif 
r e
 insurance—13 per cent of commissions. 
On the basis of the foregoing and all the facts before the Board, 
it appears that the volume, scope and nature of activities of Registrant 
J 
j 
its grandfathered subsidiary (Chicago City) do not demonstrate an undue 
c
°ncentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of 
f o r e s t , nor unsound banking practices. 
p r .
S e c t
i o n 4(c)(6) of the Act permits a bank holding company (without the 
w
bi°u
 a p
P
r o v a l
 
the Board) to acquire and hold "shares of any company 
s
ha
 
n 0 t 
i n c l u d e 
m o r e 
t h a n

 P
e r
 centum of the outstanding voting 
r e
s of such company;".

There appears to be no reason to require Registrant to ter-
minate its grandfather interests. 
It is the Board's judgment that, at 
this time, termination of the grandfather privileges of Registrant is 
not necessary in order to prevent an undue concentration of resources, 
decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of Interest, or unsound 
banking practices. 
However, this determination is not authority to 
enter into any activity that was not engaged in on June 30, 1968 and 
continuously thereafter, nor any activity that is not the subject of this 
determination; nor is this determination authority for Registrant to 
engage in any additional type of insurance agency activity or to acquire 
additional shares in any company if the Registrant's holdings in such 
company will exceed 5 per cent of the outstanding shares of such company. 
A significant alteration in the nature or extension of Regis-
trant's activities or a change in location thereof (significantly different 
from any described in this determination) will be cause for a re-evaluation 
by the Board of Registrant's activities under the provisions of § 4(a)(2) 
the Act, that is, whenever the alteration or change is such that the 
Board finds that a termination of the grandfather privileges is necessary 
to prevent an undue concentration of resources or any of the other evils 
a t
 which the Act is directed. 
No merger, consolidation, acquisition of 
assets other than in the ordinary course of business, nor acquisition of 
any interest in a going concern, to which the Registrant or any nonbank 
subsidiary thereof is a party, may be consummated without prior approval 
o f
 the Board. 
Further, the provision of any credit, property, or service 

JJ 
iagA 
^ the Registrant or any subsidiary thereof shall not be subject to any 
condition which, if imposed by a bank, would constitute an unlawful tie-in 
ar
rangeraent under § 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. 
The determination herein does not preclude a later review by 
the Board of Registrant's nonbank activities and a future determination 
the Board in favor of termination of grandfather benefits of Registrant. 
The determination herein is subject to the Board's authority to require 
Edification or termination of the activities of Registrant or of its 
^ b a n k i n g subsidiary as the Board finds necessary to assure compliance 
w i t
h the provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's regulations 
a
ftd orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasions thereof.
