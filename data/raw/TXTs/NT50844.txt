Consent calendar. The Board approved unanimously a letter to 
Virginia Commonwealth Bankshares, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, (copy 
attached as Item No. 1), granting consent to the acquisition of shares 
of Canadian Factors Corporation Limited, Montreal, Canada. 
The Board approved unanimously an amendment to footnote 14 
relating to section 226.9 of Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, designed to 
align the regulation with the current Federal holiday schedule, which 
now includes nine holidays instead of the eight authorized at the time 
the regulation was adopted. A copy of the amendment as published in the 
Federal Register is attached as Item No. 2. 
The Board unanimously authorized the publication for comment of 
a proposed amendment to section 226.6 of Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, 
that would permit creditors in making disclosures to disregard any 
variance in credit terms that would occur as a result of leap year. A 
copy of the notice of proposed rule making is attached as Item No. 3. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar.

Draft bill to amend Hatch Act, On September 16, 1971, the Board 
deferred consideration of a draft letter to the Office of Management and 
Budget regarding a proposed Civil Service Commission bill to regulate 
political activities of Federal and certain State and local employes, 
and requested that Messrs. Holland, Smith, Johnson, and Layton study the 
bill further. In a memorandum from the Legal Division dated September 27, 
which had been prepared to supplement that Division's September 14 memo-
randum, it was indicated that the bill had now been considered by the 
appropriate officers. The draft letter had been revised to take account 
of their comments and those of members of the Board and was submitted with 
the September 27 memorandum. In a memorandum dated September 30, 
Mr. Holland suggested certain additional revisions of the draft letter. 
Discussion of Mr. Holland's draft letter indicated that there was 
general agreement with the overall tone and content; however, there were 
several suggestions for editorial revisions. During discussion it also 
was suggested that a meeting be arranged with appropriate officials of 
the Civil Service Commission in an attempt to gain the Commission's 
support of the Board's position as expressed in the letter. 
The Board then approved the letter unanimously, with the under-
standing that it would be revised in light of today's discussion. It 
also was agreed that a meeting with Civil Service Commission officials 
would be arranged. A copy of the letter in the form transmitted to the 
Office of Management and Budget is attached as Item No. 4.

The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Governor Mitchell reported that the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Bank Regulation had discussed the change in FBI policy to 
no longer process fingerprints taken from applicants for employment in 
banks as a result of Judge Gesell's opinion in Menard v. Mitchell. He 
stated that the general conclusion of the agency representatives was 
that they would be inclined to support legislation that would permit 
the FBI to process fingerprints taken from applicants for employment in 
banks and then inform the prospective employer about the applicant's 
conviction record and arrest record for major crimes such as embezzlement. 
After discussion it was agreed that a letter along similar lines would be 
prepared for the Chairman's signature to Mr. Wriston of the New York 
Clearing House in response to his recent letter regarding proposed 
legislation in this area. A copy of the letter subsequently sent is 
attached as Item No. 5. 
Discussion then turned to the request of Representative Patman 
for results of the survey of bank interest charges showing changes in 
"typical" stated rates from August 14 to August 28, 1971. The Board 
agreed that responses of individual banks could not be made available 
to Mr. Patman. With respect to the grouped data it was pointed out that 
some of the changes shown by the raw data might reflect different levels 

2 5 2 1 
10/1/71 
-5-
of risk in rates reported for the two periods rather than general 
changes in the rates quoted and there might also have been very thin 
samples for some categories. After discussion of the problems involved, 
it was decided to refer the matter to Governor Mitchell's Committee on 
Financial Statistics to develop an appropriate solution to the statis-
tical problems, after which a response to Mr. Patman's request would 
be prepared. 
(Note: A copy of the response subsequently sent to 
Mr. Patman is attached as Item No. 6.) 
All staff members except Messrs. Holland, Smith, Partee, and 
Johnson then withdrew. 
Governor Maisel reported that the Board had received a letter 
dated September 24, 1971, from the Board of Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia proposing the appointment of Mark H. Willes 
as First Vice President of the Bank for the unexpired portion of the 
five-year term ending February 29, 1976. Governor Maisel indicated that 
this proposal was agreeable to the Committee on Organization, Compensation, 
and Building Plans, but that because of Mr. Willes' inexperience it was 
felt that the proposed salary of $36,000 was too high and the initial 
salary should be $32,500. The Board approved the appointment and the 
lower salary recommended by the Committee. A copy of the letter sent 
to Chairman England of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia pursuant 
to this action is attached as Item No. 7.

Governor Sherrill recommended that, effective October 15, 1971, 
the Office of Executive Director be given direct supervision of the 
Division of Personnel Administration, the Controller's Office, and the 
Division of Administrative Services. The Executive Director would be 
responsible for reporting to the Board and to its members with delegated 
executive responsibilities (currently Chairman Burns and Governor Sherrill) 
on the activities of these three divisions. The Board approved this 
recommendation. 
The meeting then adjourned.

[Reg. Z] 
PART 226--TRUTH IN LENDING 
Right of rescission -- Business Days

is amended to read as follows:

--For the purpose of this section, a business day is any 
calendar day except Sunday and those legal public holidays specified 
in Section 6103(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code (Neu Year's 
Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, 
Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day). 
2a» 
Part 226 (Regulation Z) was issued by the Board 
pursuant to the statutory mandate in the Truth in Lending Act to 
prescribe Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Act. This 
amendment applies to that portion of Regulation Z, Section 226,9, which 
provides customers with the right to rescind certain consumer credit 
transactions. That Section provides that a customer has three business 
days in which to cancel a rescindable transaction. Footnote 14 to 
the Regulation presently provides that Sundays and the eight Federal 
holidays authorized at the time the Regulation became effective 

2544 
-2-
(July 1, 1969) arc not. to be considered as business days. Subsequently, 
i 
i Public Law 90-363 wo3 enacted which adds a ninth public holiday, 
Columbus Day* This amendment: to Footnote 14 includes Columbus Day as 
a nonbusiness day for purposes of § 226.9. 
b. Since the amendment in technical in nature and simply 
aligns the Regulation with the current public holiday schedule, it was 
adopted by the Board without following the procedures of Section 553 
of Title 5, United States Code, relating to notice, public participation 
and deferred effective date. In addition, following these procedures 
of the Code would have delayed the effective date of the amendment 
beyond October 11, 1971, the day on which Columbus Day is observed 
this year.

Item No. 3 
10/1/71 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
[12 CFR PART 226] 
[Reg. Z] 
TRUTH IN LENDING 
Leap Year 
1. Pursuant to the authority contained in the Truth in 
Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), the Board of Governors proposes to 
amend Part 226 (Regulation Z), in the manner and for the reasons net forth 
belov?: 
Amend § 226.6 by the addition of a new paragraph (i) to read 
as follows: 
§ 22.6.6--GENERAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
* 
* 
* 
* 
(i) Leap year. Any variance in the amount of any finance 
charge, payment, percentage rate, or other term required under this Part 
to be disclosed, or stated in any advertisement, which occurs by reason 
of the addition of February 29 in each leap year, may be disregarded, and 
such term may be disclosed or stated without regard to such variance, 
2. 
The amendment would permit creditors to ignore any 
variance in terms which occurs as a result of leap year, and will 
facilitate the use of preprinted disclosures without the need for the 
Preparation of new forms solely as a result of leap year. In general 
a n y variance.J-n. terms caused a s a result of leap year will be minor. 
Correction: Reference should be to a nevr 
paragraph (l) rather than (i).

ADDRESS OFFICIAL CDRSEBPONOENCE 
TO THE llOAND 
October 1, 1971 
Mr. Wilfred H. Romrnel 
Assistant Director for Legislative Reference 
Office of Management and Budget 
Washington, D.C. 20503 
Dear Mr. Rommel: 
I am writing in response to Legislative Referral Memorandum 
of August 2, 1971> requesting the Board's views on a draft bill prepared 
by the Civil Service Commission "To provide for the regulation of^ 
political activities of public employees, and for other purposes." 
The fourth paragraph of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act 
(12 11 S C 244) provides that Board members and employees' "employment, 
compensation, leave, and expenses shall be governed solely by the provi-
sions of this (Federal Reserve) Act, specific amendments thereof, and 
rules and regulations of the Board not inconsistent therewith." Examina-
tion of the history of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act and its 
amendment in 1933 reveals an express Congressional desire to exclude 
Board employees from anv supervision by the Civil Servicc Commission. 
The above provision of the Federal Reserve Act is an important element 
of the special status within the Government which Congress has accoraed 
the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board has always believed that the Federal Reserve's 
special status carries with it a special responsibility to avoid partisan 
political activity on the part of the organizations and personnel within 
the Federal Reserve System. In discharge of this responsibility, the 
Board has over the years promulgated a long series of instructions on 
this subject. Some of these considerably antedate the Hatch Act. The 
position of the Board on this matter is exemplified by its latest 
communication on this subject in a letter dated November 29, 1968 to 
the Presidents of the Reserve Banks. A copy of that letter is enclosed 
for your information. The letter is specifically directed to activities 
of directors and officers of the Reserve Banks, but the Board believes 
that 51 fairly represents its posture with respect to political activities 
of Board members and employees as well. The Board feels that the 
promulgation and enforcement of its rules have conformed with the spirit 
and intent of both the Hatch Act and the Federal Reserve Act in this 
delicate area. 

2548 
Mr. Wilfred H. Rommel 
-2-
Generally, new legislation should be enacted only when there 
is a demonstrable need for it. This seems particularly so when en-
actment of the legislation would be inconsistent with other longstanding 
statutory provisions, such as section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act. 
The Board, therefore, recommends that the reference to "the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System" be deleted from the 
draft amendment to section 7325 of Title 5. The Board also recommends 
deletion from proposed section 1501(4) of Title 5 of the indication 
that a Federal agency "does not include a member bank of the Federal 
Reserve System". Inclusion of that phrase seems unnecessary since the 
nearly 6,000 member banks of the Federal Reserve System are all 
privately owned commercial banks. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

Dear Mr. Wriston: 
In your letter of September 24, 1971, you state that in 
view of Judge Gesell's opinion in Menard v. Mitchell, the F.B.I, 
no longer processes fingerprints taken from applicants applying 
for employment in banks. You note that the Department of Justice 
feels Congressional action will be required if this service to 
banks is to be reinstated. 
The Board has given preliminary and brief consideration 
to the substance of the proposed legislation which you attached 
to your letter. The Board is inclined to support legislation that 
would permit the F.B.I, to process fingerprints taken from appli-
cants for employment in banks and then inform the prospective 
employer about an applicant's conviction record and arrest record 
for major crimes such as embezzlement:. 
At such time as the Board receives a request for comments 
on any proposed legislation, it will be carefully reviewed and it 
is probable the Board will comment generally along the lines indi-
cated aboveo 
Very truly yours

October 13, 1971 
The Honorable Wright Patman 
Chairman 
Committee, on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 20515 
\ 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
i 
As requested, I am enclosing results of our survey of interest rates 
charged by member banks. The banks selected for the survey (297 in 
total) included the 150 largest in terms of deposits and a random 
selection of other member banks ranging in size down to $25 million 
in total deposits. Replies were received from 295 banks. 
As you recognize, the survey was conducted on the understanding that 
information received from individual banks would be held confiden-
tial. VJithin the limitations imposed by that understanding, I have 
tried>in this letter and the accompanying tables to provide the 
information you request. 
The results of the survey are summarized in the two attached tables* 
Table X shows both the typical average effective annual rate and 
the rate on riskier loans charged by respondent banks during the 
weeks ended August 14 and August 28, respectively0 
These effective 
annual rates are converted from the stated rates reported on the 
survey forms in order to put rates applied using different methods 
of charge (add-on, discount and outstanding balance) on a standard 
basis. 
As may be seen from Table I, changes in the effective rates between 
the two weeks are, almost without exception, very small, and decreases 
substantially outweigh increases. It should be noted that the rates 
are. rounded to two decimal places, so that some of the changes 
observed may result simply from the rounding procedure,. 
Table XI shows a summary of changes in the typical stated rates 
reported by individual respondent banks for the weeks ended August 14 
and August 28. Such changes could be computed, of course, only when

Item No. 7 
10/1/71 
ADDRESS orrtCIAt- CORRESPONDENCE 
TO THE BOARD 
October 1, 1971 
Mr. B. L. England 
Chairman, Board of Directors 
Federal. Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
925 Chestnut Street 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
19101 
Dear Mr. England: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has 
approved the appointment by the Board of Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia of Mark H. Willes as First Vice President, 
however, for the reasons indicated below, the Board approved a salary 
of $32,500 per year for Mr. Willes. 
The Board of Governors agrees with your suggestion that 
Philadelphia need not appoint a first vice president who will be 
primarily concerned with the direct responsibility for operations. 
Rather, a vice president may play a significant role as an alternate 
for the president in his many functions with respect to both the Bank 
and the community, while at the same time performing other specific 
management duties. 
The Board recognizes, as you do, the risks involved in the 
appointment of an officer to this job, even though one extremely well-
trained and of a high intellectual capacity, without the normal^ 
experience which most first vice president appointees have had in 
management and community responsibilities. 
Consequently, the Board felt that Mr. Willes' achievements 
to date would not justify an initial salary of $36,000 recommended by 
your Directors. Because of this same lack of experience, we assume 
that your Board of Directors will be extremely careful in checking 
to make certain that Mr. Willes grows as expected both in capacity 
and in his ability to perform fully all of the necessary functions 
of the position of first vice president. We believe that his 
initial period should be considered as one of challenge and growth 
and that during it a very specific review should be made of his

performance not merely in terms of adequacy but against a standard 
of the highest level of performance that can properly be expected 
in this position. 
We suggest that two logical times exist for such a complete 
evaluation of his performance. Since Mr. Willes would be eligible 
for a $3,500 salary increase on January 1, 1973, we would hope that 
your Board of Directors could carefully review his first-year 
performance at that time when a recommendation would be necessary as 
to whether or not a salary increase would be granted. The second 
logical time for an evaluation would be during the fall of 1975 prior 
to the expiration of the First Vice President five year term on 
February 29, 1976. While Mr. Willes gives every indication that he 
will achieve a successful career, the significance of this appointment 
for the future of the Philadelphia Bank is so great that we feel the 
performance must be carefully reviewed and a change in the vice 
presidency planned if, contrary to expectations, that appears necessary. 
With respect to your request for approval of the salary for 
Mr. Boelme, this is being processed in the usual way and you will be 
informed as soon as the decision is made. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith 
Tynan Smith 
Secretary
