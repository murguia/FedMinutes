System to invest in shares of the Bank for International Settlements. 
The Board had last considered the issue of representation on the 
BIS board of directors on August 25, 1971. 
Discussion at today's meeting revealed a general consensus 
in favor of greater Federal Reserve participation in the BIS. 
Attention focused primarily on the question of whether the Federal 
Reserve should seek to acquire shares in the BIS in addition to 
representation on its board of directors. 
After discussion, the Board unanimously agreed in principle 
to the establishment of Federal Reserve representation on the board 
of directors of the Bank for International Settlements, it being 
understood that the question of possible Federal Reserve investment 
in BIS shares would be considered further at a later date. It was 
further understood that Chairman Burns would undertake preliminary 
discussions with officials of the Departments of State and Treasury 
regarding possible Federal Reserve membership on the BIS board. 
In the course of the foregoing discussion, the Legal Division 
was requested to prepare a memorandum concerning any legal liabilities 
associated with ownership by the Federal Reserve of shares in the BIS 
or in connection with membership on its board of directors. 
All members of the staff then withdrew and the Board went 
into executive session.

Governor Holland proposed salaries for senior officers of the Board

January 1, 1974, salaries at the rates reflected in the list attached 
as Item No. 4. 
Secretary's Note: On December 21, 1973, the Committee on 
Federal Reserve Board Officer Salaries, acting under delegated 
authority, approved salaries for other officers, effective January 1, 
1974, at the rates reflected in the list attached as Item No. 5. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Sirs: 
This is in response to your request for a ruling that para-
graph Seventh of section 5136 (12 U.S.C. 24) of the Revised Statutes 
(which is made applicable to State member banks.by paragraph 20 of 
section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act) does not prohibit United States 
Trust Company of New York (USTC), a State member bank, from acquiring 
capital stock of The Depository Trust Company (DTC), a "clearing 
corporation" as defined in section 8-102(3) of the New York Uniform 
Commercial Code. 
DTC has been recently organized as a New York limited purpose 
. trust company and was admitted as a member in the Federal Reserve System 
on June 27, 19/3. It has taken over and will expand the securities 
processing functions formerly performed by Central Certificate Service, 
Inc. (CCS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange. 
DTC is itself wholly-owned, at present, by the New York Stock Exchange 
but future ownership of DTC will change as banks, stock exchanges, securi-
ties associations, and other financial institutions acquire stock of DTC 
as a means of participating in its services. The purchase of DTC stock by 
member banks would be consistent with DTC's organizational planning to 
\v achieve user ownership and thereby make its services responsive to its 
Primary users. 
. The total initial capitalization of DTC is $1,850,000. The 
twelve New York Clearing House banks and others have discussed and 
tentatively agreed upon a plan where all such banks (or, in the case 
of the eleven members owned by bark holding companies, their holding 
companies) would acquire an aggregate of about 25 per cent of its 
capital stock. Assuming the sale of such stock and full participation 
of the Clearing House affiliates, the price to USTC of its pro-rata 
share of. DTC stock would be no more than $50,000. This sura is nominal, 
both with respect to DTC's total capital and USTC's capital accounts 
(approximately $70,000,000). 

4 9 L M . 
Carter, Ledyard & Milburn 
-2- _ 
Tho stock of DTC must be at least 90 per cent held by or for 
persons (other than individuals) who are (1) subject to supervision or 
regulation pursuant to the provisions of Federal or State banking laws 
or'state insurance laws; (2) registered brokers, dealers, or investment 
companies; or (3) registered national securities exchanges or associa-
tions. Any other shares outstanding may be held only by directors as 
qualifying shares. Further, no person other than a national securities 
exchange will be allowed to hold more than 20 per cent of DTC's capital 
stock. Ultimately, ownership of DTC's stock by its participants^ 
including USTC, will be adjusted annually based upon usage of DTC s 
cervices in the preceding year. In any event, USTC's investment in 
DTC is not expected to be materially larger than the $50,000 referred 
to above. Shares of DTC are not publicly traded and may only be trans-
ferred under the above-mentioned procedures. 
The principal function of DTC will be to provide for the 
deposit of securities and the transfer and pledge thereof of book-
entry securities under section 3-320 of the Uniform Commercial Code. 
The ultimate goal is to immobilize certificates and obviate physical 
transfer of securities through establishment of an interconnecting 
nationwide system which would effect transfer of securities by book-
entry rather than by physical delivery. DTC will seek only a limited 
profit and its pricing policy is to "charge the lowest fees possible 
consistent with coverage of normal operating costs, foreseeable needs 
for new equipment and capital improvements, and a surplus position 
which encourages public confidence". 
In view of the above, it seems clear that the purchase of DTC -
stock by member banks is not motivated by an investment purpose but is 
only intended to permit participation in a system of centralized 
securities depositories and book-entry transfer of securities. After a 
comprehensive review of the legislative history of the stock prohibition 
provisions of section 5136, the Board has concluded that the instant stock 
acquisition is outside the legislative purpose to which the statute was 
directed, and that it would be contrary to the public interest to invoke 
its applicability to this transaction. Accordingly, the Board is or the 
view that section 5136 does not prohibit such acquisition and that 
State member banks may purchase shares of DTC, or any similar clearing 
corporation" (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code), to the extent 
permitted by State law.

SIMILAR LETTER SENT TO PRESIDENTS OF ALL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS 
Mr. Frank E. Morris, President 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 
Boston, Massachusetts 02106 
• 
» 
Dear-Frank: 
Several Reserve Banks have received applications recently from 
ederal Home Loan Banks in their districts for nonmember clearing accounts, 
yesumably, such accounts would be used in connection with the presenta-
tion and collection of items to be credited to or drawn on customer 
a^counts in member savings and loan associations. In the past, nonmember 
bearing accounts of this type have been confined to fiscal agency trans-
itions. 
On November 19, 1973, the Board published proposed changes to 
Ggulation J and solicited comments both on the proposal and on the basic 
thr"Ct"Ure 
t h e n a t i o n ' s payments mechanism, including participation by 
"rift institutions. In addition, the Board recently indicated that for 
G time being transfers from accounts subject to negotiable orders of 
^thdrawal in Massachusetts and New Hampshire would not be handled directly 
y the Boston Federal Reserve Bank but would continue to be cleared through 
Member banks. 
In light of the proposed changes in Regulation J, action on all 
..Plications to open nonmember clearing accounts should be deferred until 
C o m m e n t s solicited in the Board's November 19, 1973, announcement have 
considered and related questions with respect to thrift institution 
cess to the Federal Reserve's payments mechanism facilities have been 
^solved. The Board has allowed 120 days, until March 8, 1974, for receipt 
of Written comment. 
Oleoma. 
Comment by Federal Home Loan Banks is, of course, 
0£ ^ 
You may wish to bring these recent Board actions to the attention 
^ Federal Home Loan Bank officials should questions concerning such clear-
g accounts be raised in your District. 
Very truly yours, 
(signed) George, W. Mitchell
