Branch application (Item No. 1). Unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to The Savings & Trust Company of Indiana, Indiana, Pennsyl-
vania, approving the establishment of a branch in White Township, Indiana 
County. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 1. 
Survey of State and local government financing (Item No. 2). 
There had been distributed a memorandum dated July 7, 1967, from the 
Division of Research and Statistics regarding a survey proposed for the 
purpose of documenting the impact of 1966 money market conditions on 
Â« 
State and local governments. 
The proposed survey had been approved by 

2 7 4 . 0

- 2 -
the System Research Advisory Committee and by the Committee on Research 
and Statistics of the Presidents' Conference. Attached to the memoran-
dum was a draft questionnaire that had been developed to implement the 
first stage of the survey, in which responses would be requested from 
about 1,100 State and relatively large local government units drawn 
from a Bureau of the Census sample. It was contemplated that later in 
the summer a second and simpler questionnaire would be sent to a larger 
sample of smaller governmental units in order to cover the marginal 
units that presumably might have been most severely affected by the 
1966 experience. 
Procedures planned for the survey were described 
briefly in the memorandum. 
If the Board approved, the proposed ques-
tionnaire would be sent to the Bureau of the Budget with a request for 
clearance. 
After a discussion during which there was agreement with several 
editorial revisions suggested by members of the Board, the questionnaire 
was approved unanimously. A copy of the letter sent to the Bureau of 
the Budget pursuant to this action is attached as Item No. 2. 
Messrs. Koch, Sigel, Keir, and McGouldrick then withdrew. 
Changes in control of banks. There had been distributed a memo-
randum dated July 7, 1967, from the Division of Examinations regarding 
a request from Joseph P. Hutnyan, a writer for The American Banker, for 
information from reports required to be filed by banks under Public 
Law 88-593, approved in September 1964. The law required all insured 

2 7 4 1 
7/10/67 
- 3 -
banks to report (1) changes in the outstanding voting stock of any 
insured bank that would result in control or in a change in the control 
of the bank, and (2) loans made by an insured bank secured by 25 per 
cent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an insured bank. 
Although some of the information in the reports might fall within the 
exemption in the Public Information Act for "financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," the staff 
believed the following items could reasonably be divulged: 
1. Name of bank 
2. Number of shares of stock of the bank outstanding 
3. Number of shares of stock involved in the transaction 
4. The name or names of the sellers when a selling indi-
vidual or corporation owns at least 10 per cent of 
the outstanding stock 
5. The name or names of the purchasers 
6. The date of the transaction 
Attention was called to the fact that in November 1966 and February 1967 
the Board had responded to requests by Chairman Patman of the House Com-
mittee on Banking and Currency for information from reports received 
under Public Law 88-593. Mr. Patman had been given the names of banks 
whose stock was reported to have been transferred or pledged, their 
deposits, and the names of the transferees, beneficial owners, borrowers, 
and lending banks involved. It was understood that Mr. Patman intended 
to release that information, and Mr. Cardon recommended that the Board 
also make it available as a matter of routine. 
The memorandum concluded with the recommendation that Mr. Hutnyan 
be informed that the six items of information listed would be made avail-
able to him and also, on request, to others. 

1/lO/bl 
-4-
In introductory remarks Mr. Leavitt noted that the Board might 
want to give special attention to whether or not it would release the 
names of the sellers of stock; that information had not been included 
in the responses made to Chairman Patman. 
Governor Maisel said that the key consideration seemed to be 
the legal meaning of the words "privileged or confidential." 
He 
wondered whether the Board had the right to withhold any of the infor-
mation contained in these reports, and if so who was to determine 
whether the material was privileged or confidential. 
Mr. O'Connell responded that presumably the initial determina-
tion would be made by the Board, subject to confirmation or reversal 
if interested parties sought review by the courts of the Board's right 
to withhold particular information. 
In response to a question by Governor Brimmer as to how much 
hesitation he had regarding the disclosure of names of sellers of stock, 
Mr. O'Connell expressed the view that no harm would result from disclo-
sure of that information; he would furnish all of the six items of 
information the Division of Examinations had listed, but would go no 
further. 
Mr. Cardon said it was not clear to him why the package of 
information here proposed to be released was different from the one 
given to Mr. Patman, which had formed the basis for the staff analysis 
of acquisitions, changes in control, and bank stock loans of insured 

7/10/67 
-5-
banks, recently published by the House Banking and Currency Committee. 
In some respects the response here contemplated was more liberal, 
notably in disclosing the number of shares of stock transferred, while 
in other respects it stopped short of what was given to Mr. Patman. 
This package included no information regarding loans, whereas Mr. 
Patman had been given the names of borrowers and of lending banks 
(although not the amount of the loan). The information had been given 
to Mr. Patman with no indication that the Board considered it confiden-
tial, and in fact it had now been published. Therefore, it was diffi-
cult to understand why the position should be taken now that the infor-
mation was privileged or confidential. 
It seemed to Mr. Cardon that, 
although the amount of a loan should not be disclosed, the mere fact 
that a loan on bank stock had been made by a given bank might be as 
significant as a sale of bank stock, and he did not see why the names 
of borrowers and of lending banks were too confidential to release. 
Mr. O'Connell commented that, although Public Law 88-593 called 
for reports of both stock transfers and of loans with bank stock as 
security, the statute itself was not a public information or disclosure 
statute but was a supervisory measure requiring reports of specified 
types of transactions. He could not see anything in the statute to 
compel public disclosure by the supervisory agencies that received the 
reports. Historically, the Board had considered indebtedness and 
borrowing from a bank to be confidential, and it was Mr. O'Connell's 

9*y& 
4 
7/10/67 
- 6 -
belief that this type of information, as contrasted with information 
regarding sale of bank stock, should not be made generally available 
to the public. 
Governor Daane indicated that while he was in favor of making 
available the six items of information, he was uncertain what reason 
would be given if Mr. Patman drew a contrast between the information 
he had received and that now proposed to be given to a writer for a 
financial periodical. 
The ensuing discussion brought out that Mr. 
Patman's request had been for copies of the reports but, since they 
were not submitted on a standard form and their content varied, infor-
mation had been extracted from the reports for a response to Mr. Patman. 
The present request, however, was based on the Public Information Act, 
which had not been in effect at the time Mr. Patman made his request. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that the slate was clean 
and the Board could decide how much information it must make available 
in the light of the Public Information Act. The key point of the data 
in question was change in ownership. He would not be reluctant to 
disclose stock transfers indicating possible changes in control, but 
he believed that even in the light of the Public Information Act it 
would be proper to withhold information regarding loans for which bank 
stock was used as collateral, just as the Board held confidential other 
types of loans made by banks. 
Governor Maisel said he thought that point was critical. 
It 
seemed to him that there was implicit in Public Law 88-593 an assumption 

2745 
7/10/67 
- 7 -
that a loan of the type required to be reported does change control --
that these are not normal loans but are of significance in regard to 
control of banks. 
Governor Daane asked if it was Governor Maisel's thought that 
the list of six items of information proposed to be made available to 
Mr. Hutnyan should be expanded to include information regarding loans. 
During discussion of that question Mr. Hackley observed that, 
although it seemed clear that Public Law 88-593 assumed that loans on 
the security of bank stock might be significant in indicating changes 
in control of banks, it did not necessarily follow that the reports of 
such loans made to supervisory agencies must be made available under 
the Public Information Act when other bank loans need not be. 
He 
agreed with Mr. O'Connell that information regarding the loans reported 
would fall within the exemptions of the Public Information Act and 
need not be disclosed. Nor did he believe there was a problem in giv-
ing Mr. Hutnyan the names of sellers of bank stocks, whereas Mr. Patman 
had not been given that information; under the Public Information Act 
that information would be disclosed to Congress and, upon request by 
Mr. Patman, it could be given to him. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that a decision on the 
present request should not depend on what had been sent to Chairman 
Patman. He believed the decision on the present request should be 
framed in terms of forming a pattern for responding to the next request 

2746 
7/10/67 
-8-
under the Public Information Act. His inclination would be to confine 
the response to the items suggested by the Division of Examinations. 
Chairman Martin and Governor Daane indicated that they favored 
the approach Governor Robertson had suggested. 
In further discussion of the advisability of disclosing the 
names of the sellers of bank stock, the point was made that once a 
seller relinquishes his interest in a bank, his identity as a seller 
has little or no effect upon the future of the bank. While some senti-
ment was expressed in favor of dropping that item of information from 
the response, the predominant view was that there was no objection to 
i 
furnishing it to Mr. Hutnyan. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that with the expectation 
of continuing requests arising under the Public Information Act, it 
might be helpful to send a letter to all member banks regarding the 
import of this new law and the type of information the Board would be 
required to disclose. He suggested this as a public relations gesture 
and a better way to apprise member banks of what might be expected 
than to have them read in the press that the Board had released various 
pieces of information. 
Chairman Martin inquired if the same purpose might not be best 
accomplished through an article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, and 
there was general agreement with that suggestion. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the staff was authorized 
to make available to Mr. Hutnyan, and to others who might make similar 

274? 
7/10/67 
-9-
requests, the six items of information the Division of Examinations 
had recommended be disclosed. 
It was understood that Mr. Fauver would 
carry forward preparations for publication in the Bulletin of an arti-
cle regarding the course the Board expected to take with respect to 
the Public Information Act. 
The meeting then adjourned.
