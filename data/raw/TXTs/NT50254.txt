Foreign banking matters. The following items were approved 
unanimously after consideration of background information that had 
been made available to the Board. Copies are attached under the 
respective numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Letters to First Chicago International 
1-2 
Finance Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
and Northwest International Bank, New York, 
New York, granting consent to the acquisi-
tion of shares of Deltec Panamerica S.A., 
Nassau, Bahamas. 
Letter to Chase International Investment 
3 
Corporation, New York, New York, granting 
consent to the acquisition, either direct 
or through subsidiaries, of shares in eight 
specified companies. 
In connection with Item No. 3, Mr. Dahl pointed out that the 
i 1 
Proposed investments were before the Board for consideration only because 
°f the suspension, effective February 8, 1968, of the general consent 
Provisions of Regulation K, Corporations Engaged in Foreign Banking and 
• V • 
Financing under the Federal Reserve Act. Governor Robertson suggested 
that the Board might delegate authority to the staff to act on such 
cases, where there appeared to be no complicating factors, but Governor 
Brimmer expressed reservations about such a delegation at this time in 
view of the critical nature of the balance of payments problem. 
It was 
understood, therefore, that such cases would continue to come to the 

13 GG 
4/15/68

Board, but with a minimum of supporting papers in instances where the 
staff saw no particular problem. 
Maintenance of proportionate ownership interest. A memorandum 
dated April 2, 1968, from the Division of Examinations discussed the 
request of The First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, for 
permission to purchase additional shares of N.V. Slavenburg's Bank, 
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in order to maintain its proportionate 
ownership interest. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had recommended 
favorably, but the Division recommended disapproval based on the 
announced policy of the Board that equity investments in developed 
countries of continental Western Europe would not be approved unless 
circumstances clearly demonstrated that the transaction would not be 
detrimental to the U.S. balance of payments. 
Nevertheless, there was 
admittedly the question, in the administration of the Board's policy, 
how much weight should be given to the fact that a bank's inability to 
make a further investment in a foreign institution would lower its 
proportion of ownership. 
Governor Daane suggested at least exploring the matter further 
with the applicant before rendering an unfavorable decision, while 
Governor Mitchell indicated that in the circumstances of this case he 
would be inclined to approve. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view, however, that the applica-
tion was not one that could properly be approved within the present 

1367 
i 
4/15/68 
-4-
context of the foreign credit restraint program and that if the Board 
wanted to modify its guidelines it should do so only after careful 
consideration. 
Governor Robertson also felt that the proposal should 
be turned down under the current guidelines. 
Governor Sherrill then suggested developing a policy that the 
Board could administer in an orderly way, and after further discussion 
it was agreed to defer action on the application pending additional 
staff study of the basic question involved. 
Marine Midland. Memoranda dated April 11, 1968, from the 
Division of Examinations and the Division of International Finance 
presented a proposal under which Marine Midland International Corpora-
tion, New York, New York, sought permission (1) to borrow $5,500,000 
from its parent institution, Marine Midland Corporation, for a period 
in excess of one year; (2) to acquire all of the shares of Marine 
Midland Overseas Corporation, to be incorporated in the State of Delaware; 
(3) for Marine Midland Overseas Corporation to issue up to $30,000,000 
of 20 -year guaranteed sinking fund debentures, which would be convertible 
into common stock of Marine Midland Corporation and would be sold outside 
the United States; and (4) for Marine Midland Overseas Corporation to 
acquire stock of a French bank and a French finance company at a total 
cost of approximately $8,000,000. 
A proposed letter to Marine Midland would grant consent to the 
requests subject to certain conditions reflecting recommendations of the 
Division of International Finance. 

13G8

Governor Rober tson suggested that a decision on this proposal 
be postponed pending determination of a Board policy since the proposal 
involved a number of problems that should be thought through carefully. 
In the discussion that followed it was suggested that the 
proposal might be divided into two parts. As to the request for 
permission to invest in a French bank and a French finance company, it 
seemed clear that the applicant had made commitments prior to the 
announcement of the new U.S. balance of payments program at the beginning 
of this year. The more difficult part of the proposal related to the 
establishment of a domestic subsidiary to finance those investments and 
others by means of offshore borrowing. 
Several members of the Board then indicated that they would be 
inclined to approve the proposal subject to the conditions recommended 
by the staff. However, Governor Brimmer made known that he was not 
f 
Prepared to accept those recommendations since it seemed to him that the 
Proposal constituted an attempt to circumvent the part of the credit 
restraint program aimed at discouraging investments in Western Europe. 
The applicant probably should be allowed to make the investments to which 
it was committed prior to January 1968, but the investments should be 
chargeable against the applicable foreign credit restraint program ceiling. 
Governor Robertson expressed tentative agreement and mentioned 
c
hat if Ma rine Midland were allowed to set up the Delaware corporation 

1369 
4/15/68 
-10-
for the purpose indicated, other institutions were likely to come 
forward with similar proposals. He again suggested that the staff be 
directed to study the problem further with a view to recommending a 
policy that would be harmonious with the objectives of the current 
balance of payments program. 
Following further discussion, the staff was requested to make 
such a study and submit recommendations. 
Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of The Pelzer-Williamston Bank, 
Williams ton, South Carolina, with Southern Bank and Trust Company, 
Greenville, South Carolina, was approved unanimously for transmittal to 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The conclusion read as 
follows: 
Existing and potential competition would be eliminated 
upon consummation of the proposed merger of The Pelzer-
Williamston Bank with Southern Bank and Trust Company, Green-
ville; the overall effect of the proposed merger on competi-
tion would be adverse. 
Bank of Virginia. The Board authorized issuance of an order 
and statement reflecting its approval on April 8, 1968, of applications 
°f The Bank of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia, to merge with The Peoples 
Bank of Reedville, Reedville, Virginia, and The Peoples Bank of White 
Stone, White Stone, Virginia.

S. 2959. A memorandum dated April 4, 1968, from the Legal 
Division discussed a request from Chairman Sparkman of the Senate 
Banking and Currency Committee for the Board's 
views on S. 2959, a 
bill to remove the $15,000 limitation on insurance of funds invested 
by public units in insured savings and loan associations and in insured 
commercial banks or mutual savings banks. The bill would give the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation authority to regulate 
the maximum amount of such investments in savings and loan associations, 
but no authority would be granted to any Government agency to limit 
the amount of such deposits that could be accepted by banks. A draft 
°f reply opposing the enactment of S. 2959 was submitted. 
Members of the Board commented on problems presented by the 
bill, and the view was expressed generally that the legislation would 
not be desirable. Among the points mentioned were the exposure that 
would be created by removing the limitation on insurance available for 
Public deposits without including provisions limiting the size of such 
deposits in relation to total deposits or capital funds, the question of 
Placing the public depositor in a preferred position from the standpoint 
of insurance coverage, and the likelihood that financial institutions 
would reduce their holdings of Treasury and municipal obligations 
Presently held for pledging. 
In the course of the discussion Board members suggested revised 
language for portions of the reply to Chairman Sparkman, and there 

1371 
4/15/68 
-10-
appeared to be general agreement that a blending of the several sugges-
tions would most suitably convey the views of the Board. 
It was then agreed that another draft of reply should be 
prepared for review by the Board. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, 
Sherman, Hackley, and Hart then withdrew from the meeting. 
3 
Officer salaries at New York. The Board approved unanimously 
the payment of salaries to four newly-appointed officers of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York at the respective annual rates fixed by the 
Board of Directors. A copy of the letter reflecting the Board's action 
is attached as Item No. 5. 
However, the Board noted that the Reserve Bank had once again 
followed the procedure of requesting approval of the salary rates after 
the date on which the salaries were to become effective. Members of 
the Board expressed dissatisfaction with this procedure and proposed 
that the Reserve Bank be advised that hereafter the Board would expect 
the Bank to submit proposed salaries in ample time to permit Board 
conside 
ration before the date on which the salaries were to become 
e
ffective.

activities of two employees of that securities firm in obtaining advance 
information on the terms of Treasury financing through a former employee 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 
He indicated that no 
further action was contemplated until it could be ascertained how the 
management of the firm dealt with the matter on its own initiative. 
Coordinating Committee. 
Governor Mitchell, who had attended, 
in place of Governor Robertson, a recent meeting of the Interagency 
Coordinating Committee on Bank Regulation, reported on matters considered 
at the meeting, particularly the form of the call report. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: 
Governor Robertson today 
approved on behalf of the Board the appoint-
ment of Niles J. Wusterbarth as Summer Assis-
tant in the Office of the Secretary, with 
basic annual salary at the rate of $5,565, 
effective the date of entrance upon duty, as 
recommended in a memorandum from that Office. 
On April 15, 1968, actions were taken on behalf 
of the Board under delegated authority as reflec-

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
u ,. 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATIONS BY THE BANK OF VIRGINIA 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGERS WITH THE PEOPLES BANK OF REEDVILLE 
AND THE PEOPLES BANK OF WHITE STONE 
a . 
STATEMENT 
The Bank of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia ("Virginia Bank"), 
V;l
th total deposits of $283 million, has applied, pursuant to the Bank 
I I e r
£er Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Board's prior approval of the 
^rger of that bank with The Peoples Bank of Reedville, Reedville, 
V i r
8lnla ("Reedville Bank"), and The Peoples Bank of White Stone, White 
S t
one, Virginia ("White Stone Bank"), which have deposits of $5 million 
and 
$ 3 % 5 
million, respectively. 
The banks would merge under the 
c
^ r t e r and name of Virginia Bank, which is a member of the Federal 
^serve System. As an incident to the mergers, the two offices of 
^edvlli e Bank and the sole office of White Stone Bank would become 
br 
inches of Virginia Bank, increasing the number of its offices to 36. 
Competition. - Virginia Bank, the fifth largest bank in 
^ g l n l a , holds about 4.7 per cent of the total commercial bank deposits

Commonwealth Banlcshares, Inc., which is the fourth largest banking

hold about 7 per cent of the deposits held by all of the State's commercial

No affiliate of the holding company has offices nearer to Reedville

separating their offices and the sparsely settled nature of the inter-
vening area, which contains two offices of other banks; further, under 
State lav;, neither bank would be permitted to establish a de novo branch 
outside the county in which it is headquartered. 
Virginia Bank is headquartered in Richmond, approximately 
70 miles west of Uhite Stone and 85 miles west of Reedville. The nearest 
office of Virginia Bank to the banks proposed to be acquired is its 
branch in Newport News, which is about 57 miles south of White Stone and 
77 miles south of Reedville. State law would preclude Virginia Bank from 
e n
tering either Northumberland or Lancaster County by de novo branching. 
"*he holding company of which Virginia Bank is a subsidiary could enter 
these counties through the establishment of new banl:sc 
In view of the 
size of the communities and the existing banking facilities, however, 
such entry does not appear probable. 
Consummation of the proposed mergers would have no significant 
adverse effects on competition. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The banking 
factors with respect to each of the banks proposed to be acquired are 
reasonably satisfactory, as they would be with respect to the resulting 
bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities. - The mergers would 
have no material effect on the banking convenience and needs of the 
communities in which Virginia Bank presently operates offices. 
The areas served by Reedville Bank and White Stone Bank are 
generally rural in character; commercial fishing and its related industries

provide the principal economic support for these areas, although there 
is some farming and resort activity. The replacement of Reedville Bank 
and Uhite Stone Bank by offices of Virginia Bank, with its larger lending 
limit and broader range of bank services, would afford added convenience 
for the Reedville/Uhite Stone areas. In addition, the availability of 
full 
-scale banking services might have a favorable influence on the 
economic growth of these areas. 
Summary and conclusion. - In the judgment of the Board, the 
Proposed mergers would benefit the banking convenience and needs of the 
communities now served by Reedville Bank and White Stone Bank, and would 
have no significant adverse effects on banking competition. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the applications should 
he approved.
