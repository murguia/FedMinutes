Item No. 1 
7/19/68 
July 19, 1968. 
The Federal Reserve today made public the report of a 
Astern committee which has completed an intensive, three-year 
estudy of Federal Reserve lending policies. The document, 
titled ' ^appraisal of the Federal Reserve Discount Mechanism," 
9 f f ' 
irms three long-established principles of Federal Reserve 
ndin8> but it also proposes several significant changes in 
lencj ^ 
8 Policies and procedures aimed at providing more liberal 
atld clear 
ar-cut access for member banks to Federal Reserve lending 
facilit 
Fed 
l e s- 
T h u s redesigned, the "discount window"--as the 
e r a I R e s erve Banks' lending facilities are often called--
exPected to play a more active part in enabling commercial 
more effectively meet their communities1 credit needs. 
b a ^ s to 
^ J i r i n c i ^ i es reaffirmed 
Use 
First among the basic principles governing the 
o f Federal Reserve credit is that Federal Reserve System 
iendl*g is fn 
«-o accommodate bank asset and liability adjustments 
° V e r U m i t e d 
fl 
UctUations 
time periods and to meet essentially short-term 
it 
J-n member bank needs for funds. Coordinately 
intended that individual member banks shall not be 
and permanently in debt to the Federal Reserve. 

The second principle reaffirmed, however, is that 
Federal Reserve Banks always stand ready to lend to any of 
their member banks caught in special regional or local 
adversities--such as drouths, drastic deposit drains, or 
°ther emergencies — for as long as reasonably needed for the 
bank to work out of these circumstances. 
Thirdly, the report recognizes that the Federal 
Reserve serves as 1 lender of last resort' to buttress the 
entire financial system in the event of widespread emergency. 
Within the limits of existing law, and lending primarily 
trough the conduit of member banks, the Federal Reserve is 
prePared to supply liquid funds to other groups of financial 
*-nstitutions when such assistance is not available elsewhere 
3 n d 
necessary to avoid major economic disruption. 
^Hijicant new elements 
To provide more clear-cut access to Federal Reserve 
Y -K •••> ., v. i • 
n8 facilities, the report proposes that each soundly 
Plated member bank be given a "basic borrowing privilege," 
nat>ling it to borrow limited amounts of funds from its Reserve 
Bank uPon request in as much as half of its weekly reserve 
P eUods. 

< <\) 
-3-
In addition, it is proposed that any member bank 
foreseeing large seasonal bulges in its needs for funds would 
be able to arrange for loans from its Reserve Bank to help meet 
3 1 1 such needs in excess of a specified minimum. This arrange-
ment, more explicit and more liberal than currently provided, 
i s termed the "seasonal borrowing privilege.1' 
Member banks experiencing drains of funds that are 
n°t of a seasonal or emergency nature, but that are bigger or 
longer in duration than can be accommodated under the new 
basic borrowing privilege," are not precluded from short-term 
borrowings from their Reserve Banks pending a prompt reversal 
their fund outflows or an orderly adjustment of their assets 
a n d liabilities. Such borrowings would be subject to essentially 
^ e same kinds of administrative procedures now applied to member 
bank borrowings from their Reserve Banks. 
A final major new idea proposed by the report is to 
make the discount rate--the interest rate charged by Federal 
^serve Banks on their loans to member banks--more flexible 
^an heretofore. It is recommended that the discount rate be 
cbanged considerably more frequently, to keep it reasonably 
losely in line with the movements in other money market rates.

Status of the discount report 
The report was adopted unanimously by a study committee 
wade up of three members of the Board of Governors and four 
Federal Reserve Bank Presidents. None of its recommendations 
has been acted upon by the Board. The report is being made 
generally available so that comments and suggestions of the 
banking community and the public at large may be considered 
before any revision of Regulation A, the Board's rule governing 
lending to member banks, is published. Time will be allowed 
o r careful and intensive consideration of the proposals both 
within and without the System before any final decisions on the 
matter are made by the Board. 
Solution of the discount mechanism 
— 
The proposed redesign represents the latest in a 
Series of evolutionary changes in Federal Reserve lending policies 
Q n d Procedures. When first established by the Federal Reserve 
in l^lJj the discount mechanism was expected to operate by 
Member banks presenting certain types of short-term customer 
n° t e s (termed "eligible paper") as collateral for borrowing at 
t h° R e s erve Bunks. During most of the first twenty years of 
deral Reserve operation, member banks borrowed a sizable 
oportion of their total required reserves on the security of 
customer notes. During the next twenty years, however; member 
ks accumulated large amounts of Government securities and other 

liquid assets; accordingly, they did very little borrowing from 
their Federal Reserve Banks, and collateralized such borrowing 
a s t h ey did with Government securities. This marginal role 
the discount window was recognized in a formal change in 
1Cj55 in the Board's Regulation A covering loans to member 
banks; under that revision, bank borrowings from the Federal 
n 
serve were to be limited to assistance over the peaks of 
temporaryseasonal or emergency needs for funds that exceeded 
t h e dimensions that the banks themselves were capable of 
reasonably meeting out of their own resources. 
In the last decade or so, however, credit demands 
° n b a n k s have grown and loan-to-deposit ratios are much 
higher. Moreover, at many banks more sophisticated portfolio 
^agement has pared liquidity positions substantially. 
°r*owings from other sources than the Federal Reserve 
bflve p 
xpanded. In view of these developments, the proposed 
design of the discount mechanism is aimed at relating 
federal p 
reserve lending more clearly and closely to the 
anging banking and community needs.

•S^jlc borrowing privilege 
The most commonly used of the new lending provisions for 
member banks in good standing would undoubtedly be the basic borrowing 
Privilege because it would provide credit up to specified time and 
0 u n t limits on a virtually no-questions-asked basis. 
The size of each bank's basic borrowing privilege would be 
established as a proportion of that bank's capital stock and surplus. 
The Present proposal calls for each bank to have a basic borrowing 
Privilege equal on a reserve period average basis to between 20 per 
C e n t a n d 
per cent of its capital stock and surplus up to $1 million, 
etween 10 per cent and 20 per cent of its capital stock and surplus 
between $1 million and $10 million and 10 per cent of its capital 
stock 3 A 
a n d surplus in excess of $10 million. Thus a bank with $1 million 
CaPital stock and surplus could borrow between $200 and 
thousand on each day of the seven-day reserve period or between 
and $2,800 
thousand on one day during the period. 
Frequency of use of the basic borrowing privilege would 
al So b 
6 ^ mited. This is necessary because Federal Reserve credit is 
Hot D r 
Perly a long-term or permanent addition to the loanable funds 
ndividual member banks. The aim is to make credit available over 
a lo 
8 en°ugh period to cushion the bulk of short-term fluctuations or 
adjustments and in most cases permit orderly adjustment to longer-
t e t m movements of funds. 
^he proposed frequency limitation would allow access to credit 
8° 
as th 
cne bank is indebted in no more than half the reserve periods 
i.o., so long nfl the bank does not use adjustment credit 
the 

2774 
-7-
in more than 6 (or up to 13) of the 13 (or up to 26) consecutive 
reserve periods ending with the current period. Thus, whether a 
member bank is eligible to use its basic borrowing privilege at any 
t* m e i s established by examining its record of borrowing at the window 
f°r adjustment purposes for the previous 12 (or up to 25) reserve periods. 
Before the plan is finally made effective, choices will be 
made i n the H g h t 0f comments received as to the particular percentages 
vithin the indicated ranges which would apply to the amount and frequency 
1 Stations. 
The considerations will be that individual credit access 
h° U l d n o t b e 8 0 small or so infrequently available as to be insignif-
a n t to the member banks, nor should total access be so liberal as to 
e 
the ability of the Federal Reserve to undertake any necessary 
°f£settMno 
°*>en market operations. 
(Adjustment credit beyond these 
^mit 8 
I i v 
w i n be available, as described elsewhere, to any member bank 
having 
a justifiable need larger or longer in duration than could be 
mmodated within the basic borrowing privilege, and therefore the 
c borrowing privilege does not represent the maximum Federal Reserve 
Crp-dit to wh 
° vrtiich the member bank could have access and need not encompass 
1 K 
atlk n G f t d a ^ i c h may be expected to arise.) 
Borrowing within the basic borrowing privilege limitations 
C°Uld> as nnh ^ 
noted, take place virtually upon request, unless the Reserve 
^auk has 
notified the member bank that its over-all condition is 
^Haatisf 
actory as determined by such factors as adequacy of capital, 
l l^tdi ty 
, 
j» soundness, management, or noncompliance with law or regulation 
and that 
such unsatisfactory condition is not bp.ing corrected to the

Reserve Bank's satisfaction. The only other circumscription on the 
actions of a qualified borrowing bank would be the avoidance of net 
sales in the Federal funds market during the reserve periods in which 
l t was borrowing from the Federal Reserve. This administrative rule, 
already i n force, is being continued in the interest of precluding 
detailing operations in Federal Reserve credit obtained through the 
° U n t w i n dow. 
It is, of course, recognized that circumstances might 
OCCUf as a result of miscalculations or large unforeseen movements in 
the bank'o 
• f 
s position, in which net selling of funds would be extremely 
Ifficult to avoid. In such infrequent situations this rule would be 
Waivable. 
^^-gliustment credit 
It ia recognized that basic borrowing privileges would not 
be large 
enough to encompass every member bank's needs for funds in all 
ailCGs t h a t justify the use of discount credit. This is particularly 
true in 
ases of the larger banks which borrow infrequently but for 
rather l a r o o 
8 6 amounts, but it is also true in the ease of smaller banks 
faced with «h 
snarp temporary drains of funds. Arrangements are therefore 
as necessary to permit member bank borrowings outside the 
basic bo lowing privilege up to the limits of appropriate needs on as 
and understandable terms as possible. These arrangements are 
teferred to in -k 
An cne report as "other adjustment credit" and are virtually 
^etiticai 
to the arrangements presently existing for the use of discount 
C t° d l t ° n 8*ch a scale. 
UM ¥

When a member bank uses "other adjustment credit," it should 
expect that the circumstances of its borrowing would come under 
lamination in some detail. In many cases this would consist of a 
review of information available at the Reserve Bank. Hence it would 
involve no immediate contact with the member bank, especially if this 
review clearly showed continued credit extension to be appropriate. 
However, if the use of "other adjustment credit" becomes more extended 
ltl amount and time, the Reserve Bank would follow the case more closely 
at*d directly. In due course, the bank wculd be expected to outline 
i t s plan and timetable of adjustment and thereafter to carry it out. 
civcumstances surrounding individual borrowing cases will differ 
v?ideiy) ancj a 3 n o w 
p r e c i g e timing and nature of these administrative 
actlons would be related to such differences. Close contacts among 
Federal Reserve Banks' discount officials will be maintained in the 
itit 
G r e a t 
dealing uniformly with similar cases. 
•^3onal_borrowlng privilege 
The third general category of credit which would be available 
0 member banks at the proposed discount window is called the "seasonal 
rrowit\g privilege." 
A Reserve Bank would be prepared to establish 
such — 
n Q t - t •© seasonal pressures persisting for a period of at least 
j ii 
seasonal borrowing privilege" for any member bank experiencing 
4e,*m»trabl,

ana exceeding a minimum relative size. It is expected that 
borrowing privilege will bo of value principally to smaller unit!

l n agricultural or resort area s in which seasonal swings have a substantial 
impact on the entire community and where access to the money markets 
o r other adjustment resources is not always readily available. 
The existence of seasonal pressures would be judged on the 
basis of past years' patterns of loan and deposit fluctuations. 
totally new seasonal pressure, such as might be occasioned if a new 
industry with a strong seasonal pattern moved into a small town, would 
n o t justify establishment of a seasonal borrowing privilege in the first 
year. The resulting credit needs could be accommodated under other 
adjustment credit arrangements, however, with recognition that this 
Was i r 
•"•n fact a justifiable need, and in succeeding years a seasonal 
borrowing privilege could be formally established. 
The establishment of a qualifying seasonal swing in net 
availability of funds (defined as the net of deposits minus loans to 
Customers in the bank's market area) would ordinarily be fixed by 
ne8otiation once a year. The basic data to be used in this determination 
would 1n 
i U most cases be already on file at the Reserve Banks. The 
oposal suggests that where feasible the determination of a seasonal 
rrQ,wing privilege might best be accomplished prior to the actual 
^it need, since this would permit more orderly planning on the 
r t of both the borrowing bank and the Reserve Bank. 
Once the existence of a qualifying seasonal need was 
blished, the Reserve Banks would agree to extend discount credit 

Z'778 
-11-
UP to the qualifying amount and for the length of time the need 
*as expected to persist, up to 90 days. The 90-day maximum is 
imposed by statute; however, should the need extend over a longer 
Period than this, the Reserve Banks would regard renewals of credit 
ciS i 
n accordance with the initial seasonal credit negotiation. 
Seasonal credit needs would normally be expected to last for 
Several months, but in exceptional cases could range up to as 
m u c h as nine months. 
Seasonal credit obtainable at a Reserve Bank would be 
limited »-<-» the amount of the borrowing bank's seasonal swing in 
excess f 
ot a specified percentage of its average deposits in the 
Preceding y e a r. This "deductible" principle, requiring a bank 
to meet 
a part of its seasonal needs out of its own resources, is 
to encourage individual bank maintenance of some minimum 
V e l of liq Ui d i t y for purposes of flexibility. It also serves 
£e 
ctively to limit the aggregate amount of credit extended under 
- seasonal borrowing privilege to an amount consistent with 
overall monetary policy, while allowing the Federal Reserve to 
Provide t-h* assistance to all those member banks with relatively 
r8 e seasonal needs. The precise level of the deductible per-
tage would lie in the range of 5 to 10 per cent of average 
^Posits 
» with the final choice again to be made by the Board in 
^ght of comments received. 

The amount of credit arranged for during the original 
negotiation of a seasonal borrowing privilege would not normally 
b e revised in mid-season, but the proposal recognizes that 
^foreseen developments essentially beyond the control of the 
bor 
rrowing bank may significantly affect the need for seasonal 
redit. x n such unusual circumstances renegotiation would be 
allowed. Likewise, the Reserve Bank would, under normal 
cl*cumstances, abide by tie original negotiations. Only in the 
case of 3 1 
a clear and 3 i.gniiio&nt change in the bank's need or 
£1 
agrant abuse of the seasonal borrowing privilege would a 
Reserve 
c »ank exercise its option to curtail an outstanding 
S e a 8 0 n a l <*edit arrangement. 
Borrowings under the seasonal borrowing privilege 
»ould not- k 
be counted in determining a bank's eligibility to 
Use itq i 
basic borrowing privilege as described above.

The proposed redesign of the discount window would 
Provide th a t the Federal Reserve continue to supply liberal 
belp t Q 
s member banks in emergency situations. So long 
a® the member bank is solvent and steps are being taken 

to find a solution to its problems, credit would be available on 
the same basis as it currently is, and, within the limits of the 
law, ad hoc arrangements would continue to be made where necessary 
l i s t i n g a bank in an emergency situation would generally require 
credit extension for periods longer than would normally be allowed 
at the window, but this would be expected and regarded as 
appropriate. 
In addition, the redesigned window would recognize 
t h e Possibility that the Federal Reserve, in its role as lender 
f last resort to other sectors of the economy, might in extreme 
onditions find it necessary to extend circumscribed credit assist 
n c e to institutions other than member banks. This action would 
taken only when all other sources of credit had been exhausted 
n d f a i X ure of the troubled institutions would have a significant 
mPact on the economy's financial structure. When lending to 
^members, the Federal Reserve would act in cooperation with 
the 
relevant supervisory authority to insure that steps are 
take to find a solution to its problems. Credit would normally 
extendod through a conduit arrangement with a member bank 
and would i 
oe provided at a significant penalty relative to the 
Prevailing discount rate. 

jVA/C, \ 
The proposed discount window does not include the 
Provision of intermediate or long-term credit to meet the needs 
Of 
h 
banks servicing credit-deficit areas or sectors--that is, 
area 
s or sectors where the opportunities for profitable investment 
c°nti.nuously outstrip the savings generated locally. While this 
i s recognized as a problem of some significance, it was concluded 
^ ha t attempting to solve this problem through the discount window 
Would involve socio-economic and political decisions outside the 
Proper scope of System responsibility. It was also felt that 
fina 
ncing the expansion of loan portfolios far beyond the limits 
ePosits through the provision of long-term discount credit 
Would 
seriously and in some cases dangerously distort the normal 
balanr 
u 
e sheet structure of commercial banks. The Steering Committee 
c°ncluH a 
e d that an appropriate and effective solution to the problem 
was 
0 s t likely to be found in the improvement of secondary markets 
bi 
biliti 
a n k a s s ets and liabilities. Detailed studies of the feasi-
y 
actions to promote such improvement are expected to begin 
l n ^ e near future.

would not, however, mean a corresponding increase in total reserves, 
since increased borrowing would be expected to be about offset by 
correspondingly smaller net System purchases of securities in the 
°pen market. 
The study committee recognizes that a period of transi-
tion would undoubtedly be required before the full potential of 
... 
the proposed redesign of the discount window could be realized 
by either the Federal Reserve or the member banks. However, it 
believes that this redesign can bring the mechanism into closer 
touch with the prevailing economic climate and lead to a more 
effectively functioning member banking system. 
The table attached to this release summarizes the 
Proposals contained in the current report. It outlines the 
several complementary arrangements for borrowing at the window, 
each designed to provide credit for a specific type of need. These 
e the basic borrowing privilege (column (1)), other adjustment 
redit (column (2)), the seasonal borrowing privilege (column (3)) 
a n d 
emergency credit assistance, both to member banks (column (4)) 
atld t 0 other financial institutions (column (5)).

ADDRESS • FFI C IAL CDRRE 
TO THE BOAR 
July 19, 1968. 
uf 
Chase Manhattan Overseas 
Banking Corporation, 
1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, 
New York, New York. 10015 
Gentlemen: 
Vl- v J'i' S 
•a itiiH&i* ; 
The Board has carefully considered your request of 
April 2, 1968, for a modification of its consent of March 6, 
1968, for an additional investment by your Corporation in 
Oesterreichische Kommerzialbank, A.G. ("Kommerzialbank"), 
Vienna, Austria, in the form of a "dedicated deposit account.' 
That consent was granted on the understanding that any. con-
tributions to the "dedicated deposit account" would be fully 
reserved against on the books of your Corporation. 
In the Board's opinion, the "dedicated deposit ac-
count" in this case represents a contribution to the capital 
of Kommerzialbank to provide for anticipated losses in its 
loan portfolio and constitutes an additional investment by 
your Corporation in Kommerzialbank. The Board believes fur-
ther that the character of the "deposit"--to cover your es-
timate of losses on certain loans—should be recognized in 
the form of a full reserve against the "deposit" on the books 
of your Corporation. 
Accordingly, the Board denies your request. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.
