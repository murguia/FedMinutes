Discount rate. Chairman Burns said it had been his intention 
to bring up somewhat later the question of a reduction in the discount 
rate. However, events were moving rapidly. If the Board was going to make 
a change toward moving more frequently on the discount rate, and in smaller 
steps, there was little time for delay in view of the recent downward 
movement in market rates. 
If the Board waited much longer, it probably 
would have to make a cut larger than one-quarter of a percentage point; 
perhaps that was something that the Board ought to consider even now. 
The economy, as he saw it, was weak, and a discount rate action would 

3U17 
11/10/70 
-2-
seem to be desirable at this time. He had wanted earlier to postpone 
such action for a little while so that it would not come too soon after 
the election. However, interest in the election was already fading and 
interest in the state of the economy was growing. 
The Chairman referred to the memorandum from the Division of 
Research and Statistics dated November 6, 1970, in which considerations 
with respect to a near-term cut in the discount rate had been discussed. 
He then turned to Mr. Holland, who noted that the directors of three 
Reserve Banks had acted to change the rate, subject to review and 
determination by the Board. The Boston directors had acted to reduce 
the rate from 6 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent, but with the understanding 
that if the Board decided to approve a rate of 5-3/4 per cent they 
would go along with that rate. The St. Louis and Atlanta directors 
had acted to reduce the rate to 5-3/4 per cent. He had received no 
comment with regard to the reasoning of the St. Louis directors except 
that it was understood to reflect a general feeling in favor of going 
along with the movement that had developed in market rates. The Atlanta 
directors had favored a move now for technical market reasons. They had 
considered a move to 5-1/2 per cent but had decided that that would be 
interpreted as signalling a policy change. The Atlanta directors were 
concerned about the wage-price spiral and did not want to seem to signal 
aggressive monetary ease.

Mr. Holland went on to say that he had been in contact with 
the Presidents of the other Reserve Banks and that he understood the 
Presidents of three of those Banks were going to be in touch with their 
directors today so that their Banks would be included if the Board 
approved a rate of 5-3/4 per cent today. All of the remaining Banks 
except two had indicated at least tentatively that they would be 
inclined to go along by Thursday, if not sooner. As indicated by the 
telegram from President Eastburn that had been distributed to the Board, 
the Philadelphia directors felt that a reduction in the discount rate 
could be misinterpreted as a further move toward monetary ease and 
hence would encourage inflationary expectations. If a change was made, 
the Philadelphia directors would like to see it labeled as a technical 
adjustment and the first of several steps to implement the new discount 
mechanism. One way to convey that would be to express any decrease in 
terms of basis points. 
Mr. Holland noted that the New York directors did not have a 
regular meeting scheduled this Thursday. President Hayes was consider-
ing whether to call a special meeting on Thursday; if he did, his 
inclination was to recommend a reduction of one-quarter of a percentage 
point. 
There followed a go-around of the Board members beginning with 
Governor Mitchell, who said that he would be willing to approve a 
reduction in the discount rate now. He was motivated in some measure 

3 4 3 9 
11/10/70 
-4-
by the performance of the monetary aggregates, since he felt that a 
change in the discount rate might be helpful in achieving the goals 
currently established for the aggregates. He was also hopeful that 
long-term rates might be nudged down a little more. If the discount 
rate was reduced, the prime rate might come down and there might be an 
effect on longer-term market rates through that linkage. 
Asked what size of discount rate cut he would favor, Governor 
Mitchell indicated that he would be sympathetic to a shift to discount 
rate moves in basis points, as suggested by the Philadelphia directors. 
In that context, he believed that a move to 5.7 per cent would be the 
most appropriate, with 5.6 per cent as his next choice, but he would 
not be ready to move to 5Â»5 per cent now. Another possibility, to which 
he would not object, would be to wait until the Federal Open Market 
Committee meeting next week, but all things considered he believed that 
the best course might be to change the discount rate immediately. 
Governor Daane said that he would be prepared to move today, 
although other things being equal he would have preferred to wait a 
little longer after the election. In light of developments in the 
economy, a case could be made for moving to 5-1/2 per cent, but he 
would be inclined to move to 5-3/4 per cent now and leave open the 
option of moving again in the relatively near future. 
Governor Daane also reported certain concerns about relation-
ships between U.S. policies and economic problems in European countries 

3140 
11/10/70 
-5-
that had been expressed by several foreign central bank governors at 
the Basle meetings over the past weekend. Those expressions of concern, 
to the extent that they should be taken into account, argued for moving 
in smaller steps on the discount rate, with a move of only one-quarter 
of a percentage point at this particular stage. 
Governor Maisel expressed the view that this was the time to 
act. The longer the Board waited, the more problems it would get into 
vis-a-vis the market. As of today, the Board probably could still get 
by with a reduction of 5-3/4 per cent, but if it waited much longer 
such an action would appear to be of a restrictive character, that is, 
an effort to try to stop market rates from moving further. He would 
probably prefer a move to 5.6 per cent even today, for that would look 
clearly like a technical adjustment to market developments. 
In response to questions, there followed some discussion of 
Treasury financing problems. Comments by the staff in that regard 
underscored to some Board members the desirability of taking action on 
the discount rate today. 
Governor Brimmer then said that he would prefer to do nothing 
at this point and to wait until some time after the FOMC meeting. How-
ever, as Governor Maisel had brought out, if the Board waited too long 
a move described as a technical adjustment might have to be larger than 
one-quarter of a percentage point, so it might be better, all things 
considered, to move to 5-3/4 per cent today. He was intrigued by the 

3141 
11/10/70 
-6-
idea of moving in tenths of a percentage point and felt that much could 
be said for introducing such a system. Thinking in those terms, he 
would not favor moving down to 5.6 per cent at the present time; instead, 
he would think in terms of 5.7 or 5.8 per cent. 
Governor Sherrill expressed himself in favor of moving to 5-3/4 
per cent today. He was sympathetic to the notion to shifting to a 
decimal point system, because he favored gearing the discount rate 
more closely to market rates, but he did not see that this would be 
the opportune time to effect such a change and he would not like to 
defer discount rate action. 
Governor Robertson commented that if more headway was being 
made in the fight against inflation, this would be the time, in his 
opinion, to move the discount rate down to 5-1/2 per cent. However, it 
was not apparent that sufficient headway was being made. As a practical 
matter, a shift could not be made to a decimal point system as of today 
because the actions placed before the Board by the Reserve Bank direc-
tors were not in those terms. If the Board favored moving in that 
direction, there should be discussion with the Reserve Bank Presidents 
in preparation for such a change. In all the circumstances, he would 
favor acting today to reduce the discount rate to 5-3/4 per cent. 
Chairman Burns agreed that there should be a discussion of the 
possibility of using a decimal point system for making discount rate 
changes at the time of the next FOMC meeting. An attempt to convert 

3142 
11/10/70 
-7-
sooner would be likely to create confusion and in fact might arouse a 
little resentment on the part of Reserve Bank Presidents or Reserve 
Bank directors. 
After further discussion, the Board approved unanimously the 
establishment, effective November 11, 1970, of the following rates for 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and St. Louis and for any other 
Banks that advised during the day that their directors had acted to 
establish such rates: 5-3/4 per cent on advances to and discounts for 
member banks under sections 13 and 13a of the Federal Reserve Act; 
6-1/4 per cent on advances to member banks under section 10(b) of the 
Act; and 7-1/4 per cent or 7-1/2 per cent on advances to individuals, 
partnerships, and corporations other than member banks under the last 
paragraph of section 13 of the Act. 
The Board then considered the form of press release that would 
be appropriate and authorized the issuance this afternoon of a press 
release in the form attached as Item No. 1. (Note: By the time the 
press statement was issued, advice had been received that the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco had acted to establish a discount rate of 5-3/4 per cent.) 
In connection with the discussion of the press statement, 
Chairman Burns requested that Mr. Molony give some thought to questions 
that had been raised about the most appropriate time for release of 
announcements of discount rate action and to report back to the Board 
in order that that question might be considered for the future.

In connection with the matter of the rate on advances to 
individuals, partnerships, and corporations other than member banks 
under the last paragraph of section 13, Mr. Holland noted that earlier 
the Reserve Banks had been encouraged to align that rate uniformly at 
7-1/2 per cent. It appeared that some Banks might prefer to leave the 
rate at that level, at least for the time being. After discussion, the 
Board indicated that there would appear to be no particular objection 
to approving a rate of either 7-1/4 per cent or 7-1/2 per cent at this 
juncture, but Mr. Holland was requested to review the question with 
the Reserve Banks for further consideration by the Board in the future._1/ 
The Board authorized the Secretary to advise any Reserve Banks 
whose directors acted after today to establish a 5-3/4 per cent discount 
rate of the Board's approval of such action. 
(Note: 
Pursuant to this 
authorization, the Secretary advised the following Banks of approval 
of rates they had established, effective the dates indicated: New York, 
Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas effective November 13, 1970; 
and Philadelphia effective November 16, 1970.) 
Report by Governor Daane. Governor Daane reported informally 
on the monthly meeting of central bank governors at Basle that he had 
attended over the past weekend. 
The following then entered the room: 
Mr. Hackley, Assistant to the Board 
17 In addition to Atlanta, New York and Chicago established a rate of 
7-1/2 per cent; all other Banks 7-1/4 per cent.

American International Bank. On November 2, 1970, the Board 
approved the application of American International Bank, New York, 
New York, for permission to purchase up to 40 per cent of the outstand-
ing shares of Henry Ansbacher & Co., Limited, a merchant bank located 
in London, England. However, word of this decision had not yet been 
formally conveyed to the applicant when Governor Robertson, who had 
not been present at the November 2 meeting, requested that the question 
be reconsidered, for reasons he subsequently set forth in a memorandum 
dated November 9, 1970. In essence, he urged that the Board consider 
Ansbacher as "carrying on a part of its business" or "transacting some 
of its business" in the United States by virtue of the fact that a 

3145 
11/10/70 
-10-
substantial amount of its loans related to financing of local U.S. 
projects and that there was no incidental relationship to the interna-
tional or foreign business of either the investing Edge corporation 
or of the merchant bank. In his judgment, approval of the acquisition 
would countenance the use of the capital of an Edge corporation for 
purposes unrelated to the purposes of the Edge Act and in a manner 
facilitating evasion of the reserve requirements applicable to Euro-
dollar credits to U.S. residents. 
In a memorandum dated November 6, 1970, the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation described its further exploration of the loans 
reported to have been made by Henry Ansbacher 6c Co. to U.S. companies 
for domestic purposes. Although the information obtained was incon-
clusive, the Division suggested that the Board might wish to condition 
approval of the application, if such action was decided upon, to the 
effect that lending by Ansbacher for purely domestic purposes in the 
U.S. was not to be undertaken or was not to be encouraged. As an 
alternative, the letter of approval might contain a reference to the 
fact that the Board had under further review the question of U.S. 
domestic lending by foreign subsidiaries, with the implication that 
the Board might subsequently limit such activities. 
Governor Robertson indicated at today's meeting that his 
objections would be satisfied if the Board conditioned approval upon 
elimination of loans for domestic purposes within the U.S. The 
ensuing discussion disclosed a consensus in favor of that approach. 

11/10/70 
-11-
A letter to American International Bank was then approved 
unanimously in the form attached as Item No. 2. 
It was agreed that equity and consistency of treatment pointed 
to the extension of the condition imposed in this case to other Edge 
corporations with subsidiaries that engaged in lending operations of 
the nature that had here been questioned. 
It was understood that a 
letter to such corporations would be drafted for the Board's considera-
tion, leaving for a further stage of study the question of direct 
investments in foreign organizations not controlled by U.S. banks or 
Edge corporations that extend credit for U.S. domestic purposes. 
First Security Corporation. 
On November 2 and 5, 1970, the 
Board gave preliminary consideration to the application of First 
Security Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah, to acquire shares of First 
Security Bank of Springville, Springville, Utah, a proposed new bank. 
Interest was expressed in the development of additional information 
regarding the competitive situation and actions by the Utah Commissioner 
of Financial Institutions relating to the application of a group of 
individuals to form an independent bank in Springville. The Division 
of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets Section, in a 
memorandum dated November 6, presented such supplemental information 
as it had been possible to obtain and summarized the considerations 
underlying their adverse recommendations. 

<3147 
11/10/70 
-12-
After discussion, the application was approved, Governors 
Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer dissenting. 
It was understood that an 
order and statement reflecting this decision would be prepared for the 
Board's consideration and that a dissenting statement also would be 
prepared. 
First National Bancorporation. At the meeting on November 5, 
1970, the Board discussed the application of The First National Bancor-
poration, Inc., Denver, Colorado, to acquire shares of Montbello State 
Bank, also of Denver. Action was deferred to allow further study by 
members of the Board of the underlying circumstances. 
Governor Mitchell commented that he did not agree with the 
position of the Montbello developers (and the State Bank Commissioner) 
that the area should be served by only one bank. There was room for the 
present bank and also a competitor. The efforts by the developers to 
make it difficult to obtain another bank charter in the Montbello area 
apparently had resulted in the exorbitant premium being offered for the 
stock of the present bank, which was located just outside the develop-
ment and would be transferred into it. 
Governor Daane believed that the convenience and needs factor 
weighed heavily in favor of the present proposal, which was an assured 
route of providing full banking services for the Montbello development. 
Governor Maisel associated himself with the points Governor 
Mitchell had made and expressed doubt that any great benefit to 

3148 
11/10/70 
-13-
convenience and needs could be expected. The location to which the 
applicant expected to move Montbello State Bank did not appear to be 
a great deal more favorable than the present one. 
Governor Brimmer commented that the point of buying a monopolistic 
charter for a large premium was of concern to him. 
Governor Sherrill said that although he was sympathetic to the 
misgivings that had been expressed regarding the premium being paid, 
he did not believe that that was the Board's responsibility. 
He gave 
considerable weight to the convenience and needs factor. 
The application was thereupon denied, Chairman Burns and 
Governors Daane and Sherrill dissenting. It was understood that an 
order and statement reflecting this decision would be prepared for the 
Board's consideration and that a dissenting statement also would be 
prepared. 
One-bank holding company legislation. With a memorandum dated 
November 6, 1970, Mr. Holland transmitted a paper of the staff task 
force on implementation of one-bank holding company legislation that 
examined possible approaches for obtaining data needed for evaluating 
the competitive effects of acquisitions of nonbanking enterprises by 
bank holding companies. 
Two general survey approaches might be used: 
(1) voluntary-
response market surveys, and (2) required-response surveys. The latter 
could be either market surveys undertaken in connection with specific 

3143 
11/10/70 
-14-
cases or national surveys of all firms in functionally-related industries. 
The required-response surveys could be undertaken only if Congress granted 
legislative authority to the Board to obtain data from all firms in the 
functionally-related lines. It was proposed that the Board recommend 
to the Senate-House Conference, to be convened about November 18, addi-
tional language to follow section 4(c)(8) of the pending one-bank holding 
company legislation that would help insure that the Board could obtain 
the information needed to make the necessary market determinations in 
cases arising under that section. 
Some sentiment was expressed by members of the Board in favor of 
recommending the amendment, despite reservations about requiring reports 
fron nonbanking organizations and about the likelihood of obtaining 
favorable consideration. The predominant view, however, was against the 
recommendation. Discussion included comments that a major change in 
data collection and survey techniques would be involved and that the 
question of compulsory reporting was a delicate one. Further, although 
a rationale could be presented for making the recommendation, it would 
be awkward to request the additional authority at this late stage in 
the legislative process. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, there was agreement with 
Chairman Burns' suggestion that the question of requesting legislative 
authority for required-response surveys be postponed until such time 
as experience disclosed that voluntary surveys were not adequate to 

31 
11/10/70 
-15-
produce the data needed for proper discharge of the Board's 
responsibilities. 
Membership in banker organizations. 
In a memorandum dated 
November 6, 1970, the Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations and 
the Office of the Secretary discussed proposed changes in the relation-
ship of the Federal Reserve System to the American Bankers Association 
and other banker groups. It was noted that studies of those problems 
were being made by the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve 
Banks. The memorandum included tables showing the amounts paid by the 
individual Reserve Banks for memberships in various groups. 
As to the American Bankers Association, it was believed that 
the Reserve Banks should consider discontinuing the payment of member-
ship dues and become "subscribers to services," if it were found that 
the advantages of the relationship could be maintained in that fashion. 
Association leadership was understood to be amenable to the recommended 
change in status, and President Kimbrel, Chairman of the Presidents' 
Conference Committee on Bank Coordination and Special Topics, felt 
that the Reserve Bank Presidents also would be receptive. 
Membership by the Federal Reserve Banks in State bankers 
associations, which was a longer-run issue, was also being considered 
by the Conference of Presidents and discussions were being conducted 
looking toward developing an arrangement similar to that proposed with 
the ABA. 

3151 
11/10/70 
-16-
No change was proposed in the present relationships with more 
technically oriented organizations such as the American Institute of 
Banking, the Bank Administration Institute, and Robert Morris Associates. 
It was suggested that the entire question be discussed with the 
Reserve Bank Presidents on November 17, 1970. 
Discussion dealt with the benefits derived by the Reserve Banks 
from their associations with the various organizations and the extent 
to which they would continue to be available under the proposed arrange-
ments. 
It was emphasized that the proposed arrangements must involve 
payment for appropriate services at a justifiable cost, rather than 
simply a mere change in bookkeeping procedures. In this connection, 
Chairman Burns reported that he had discussed with the members of the 
Federal Advisory Council at lunch on November 6 the problem involved 
in payment of membership dues in the American Bankers Association and 
that the Council had expressed appreciation of the problem. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, it was agreed that the 
Reserve Bank Presidents would be informed that the Board was generally 
sympathetic to the proposed approach but would take no action until 
the matter had been discussed with them. 
The meeting then adjourned.

For immediate release 
Item No. 1 
11/10/70 
November 10, 1970 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
approved actions by the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Lcuis, Minneapolis and San Francisco 
reducing the discount rate of those banks from 6 to 5-3/4 per cent, 
effective Wednesday, November 11. 
The move was in recognition of reductions that have taken 
place recently in other short-term interest rates, and is designed 
to bring the discount rate--which is the rate charged member banks 
for borrowings from their district Federal Reserve banks--into better 
alignment with short-term rates generally. 
The reduction in the discount rate, made within the frame-
work of the moderately expansive monetary policy that was initiated 
earlier this year, is the first since August 1968, when the rate was 
lowered from 5-1/2 to 5-1/4 per cent. The discount rate was increased 
to 5-1/2 per cent on December 18, 1968, and to 6 per cent on 
April 4, 1969. 
The Board's vote was unanimous.

Gentlemen: 
In reference to your letter of July 14, 1970, the Board 
of Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("AIB") to pur-
chase and hold up to 40 per cent of the outstanding shares of 
Henry Ansbacher & Co., Limited ("Ansbacher"), London, England, at 
a cost of approximately $1,525,000, provided such shares are acquired 
within one year from the date of this letter. 
In this connection, 
the purchase and holding of the above shares in excess of 15 per cent 
of your Corporation's capital and surplus is also approved. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of Ansbacher by AIB is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) That AIB shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of Ansbacher if Ansbacher at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, 
with the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase 
and hold stock, or if Ansbacher establishes any 
branch or agency or takes any action or undertakes 
any operation in England or elsewhere, in any 
manner, that would not be permissible if Ansbacher 
were a corporation organized under Section 25(a) of 
the Federal Reserve Act not "engaged in banking"; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, AIB 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of Ansbacher as it may require from 
time to time; 

3154 
American International Bank 
-2-
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by 
Ansbacher be reported under Section 211.8(d) of 
Regulation K in the same manner as if Ansbacher 
were a corporation organized under Section 25(a) 
of the Federal Reserve Act; and 
(4) That AIB shall not carry on its books the shares 
of Ansbacher at a net amount in excess of its pro-
portionate share of the book capital accounts of 
Ansbacher, after giving effect to the elimination 
of all known losses. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends until further notice the provisions of subparagraph (1) of 
the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as they 
relate to restrictions on loans granted by Ansbacher in England in 
the currency of that country. 
The Board noted that among the loans extended by Ansbacher 
were certain credits to United States residents to finance purely 
domestic activities in the United States. 
Since Edge Corporations 
are organized to engage in international or foreign banking and 
financial activities, the foregoing consent is granted on the fur-
ther condition that any new loans or credits extended by Ansbacher 
to residents of the United States will be for the purpose of financing 
international or foreign transactions and not to finance domestic 
activities within the United States except to the extent that such 
domestic financing is incidental to international or foreign transactions. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
of Association, and By-Laws of Ansbacher. 
The Board has noted that as of September 30, 1970, the 
foreign loans and investments of your Corporation exceeded the guide-
line ceiling applicable under the foreign credit restraint effort now 
in effect. The foregoing consent is given with the understanding 
that those foreign loans and investments will be reduced as soon as 
possible to a level consistent with the guidelines; that the invest-
ment now being approved will be made within those guidelines; and 
that due consideration is being given to the priorities contained 
therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.
