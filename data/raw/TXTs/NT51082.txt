In anticipation of a telephone conference meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee scheduled to be held later today, Chairman Burns 
called this meeting to discuss recent international developments and 
possible System intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Chairman 
Burns noted the importance of preserving the confidentiality of the 
matters discussed. 
A general discussion followed, during which consideration was 
given to the timing and magnitude of any System intervention, the 
currencies in which intervention might occur, and the operating procedures 
that might be pursued in the event of intervention.

made regarding the desirability of a public announcement on interven-
tion and on the expansion of the System's swap network. The members 
of the Board agreed that it would be best for Chairman Burns to be 
solely responsible for any announcements or public statements that 
might emanate from the Federal Reserve on the subject of intervention. 
The meeting then adjourned.
