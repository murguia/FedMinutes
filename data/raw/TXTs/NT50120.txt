Application of First Virginia Corporation. There had been 
distributed with a covering memorandum dated July 20, 1967, memoranda 
from the Division of Examinations, the Banking Markets Section, and 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond with respect to an application 
by The First Virginia Corporation, Arlington, Virginia, to acquire 
80 per cent or more of the voting shares of The Bank of Craigsville, 
Inc., Craigsville, Virginia. The recommendations were favorable. 
At the request of the Board, Mr. Lyon reviewed the application 
and the reasons for the favorable staff recommendation, following which 
the application was approved unanimously, with the understanding that 
an order and statement reflecting the decision would be prepared for 
the Board's consideration. 
Governor Brimmer noted that although he would approve the 
application he had one slight reservation. This related to the fact 
that with highway improvement the smaller communities in the area con-
cerned were no longer as isolated as they once had been. Thus, there 
appeared to be reason, in considering applications involving the 
acquisition of banks, to look not only at the immediate communities 
at a somewhat larger area. In view of the greater mobility of 
area residents, access to a wider range of banking locations was avail-
able to them. This factor should be taken into account in preparing 
cases for the Board's consideration, particularly when, as in the case 
First Virginia Corporation, successive applications were made to 
acquire smaller banks.

Sear Us man; 
This ia in response to your request of July 24, 1967, for 
n extension of tine within which to consummate the acquisition of 
^bria Bank, Incorporated, Chrictianaburg, Virginia, by The First 
u*3inia Corporation. 
a 
The Board16 Order of May 9, 1967, approving the trans-
ticn was contingent upon consummation not later than three months 
ac 
0 r d c r # 
Y o u 
indicated that it is improbable that the 
thaUia*tion coul<* b c consummated within that time and have requested 
t the Order bo amended to permit; consummation not later than 
«°Veober 9, 1967. 
^ 
^ It appears that reasonable cause has been shown for the 
. ension of time requested and that such extension would not be 
a ??nr'ietent with the public interest. Therefore, pursuant to 
^c»iority delegated to it by the Eoard of Governors, the Federal 
tra-CrVe Banl: 
hereby extends the time within which the 
a®action may be accomplished to permit consummation at any time 
c later than November 9 , 1967,
