^Pressing the opinion that service by A. G. 
Priggs as President and director of Greater 
Ohio Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, and as a 
^rector of The First National Bank of Ironton, 
Ronton, Ohio, would be prohibited under sec-
°
n
 32 of the Banking Act of 1933. 
' • ? 'W ;) , 
With respect to Item No. 2, the Legal Division's conclusion 
e s
ted principally upon the fact that, while Greater Ohio Corporation 
' VwhHfiUM 
• 
engaged in issuing and marketing only its own stock, its activity 
that respect was expected to extend over a year or more and the 
°
r
Poration did not as yet have definite plans for implementation of 
I h K Mi 
the 
Purpose for which it had been organized, namely, acquisition of 
stock of companies engaged in various insurance and financial oper-
at-? 
n s
« 
Consistency with earlier decisions by the Board regarding some-
what 
• jSua* j 
m M 
comparable situations therefore pointed to a finding that inter-
i 
* 
« 
locki 
i n
8 service by Mr. Spriggs would fall within the prohibition con-
n e d i n
 section 32 of the Banking Act of 1933. 
h 
Governor Maisel observed that section 32 referred to the issuance 
of Mg stocks, bonds, or other similar securities"--in the plural--and said 

V ' 
. t ,

he believed there was a basic difference between a company that issued 
. . . 
°nly its own stock and a dealer in securities. In his view, it might 
have been appropriate to use as a determining factor the question 
whether or not Greater Ohio Corporation was a dealer in securities, 
,f 
a
nd it seemed clear to him that it was not. 
a, 
The ensuing discussion included comments on several cases that 
had come up in the past involving companies engaged in issuing the lr 
mi-
n stock, along with the relevance of such questions as the duration 
r. 
the marketing period and whether the company was only in the orgai 
2a
tional stage or had taken steps to implement its organizational objec-
s
« 
It was brought out that Greater Ohio Corporation was registered 
tive 
as 
a
 dealer with the Ohio Securities Commission. Although it was rec-
"^ftized that the recommended position adhered to the literal language 
Of (-L statute, the position was generally consistent with interpreta-
tio ns dating from 1961. If the Board were to take an over-all position 
that frf» 
L n e
 statutory prohibition against interlocking directorates did 
Hot 
a
Pply when a company issued only its own stock, the staff pointed 
°ut th 
n
at a loophole would be provided for speculative enterprises. 
k 
At the conclusion of the discussion, several members of the 
B
°ard 
vilar 
e
^pressed the view that the recommended position in this partic-
c a
se was the safest approach. Governor Maisel, although indicating 
^at he o 
continued to have reservations along the lines he had stated 
r
> did not dissent from the sending of the proposed letter.

_a _ 
Proposed legislation regarding savings banks (Items 3 and 4). 
1 I'i .i . 
Pursuant to the understanding at the meeting on July 19, 1967, there 
had been distributed a revised draft of reply to a request by Chairman 
** * L . 
Parkman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency for the Board's 
V l e w s o n s

 a b
i H to authorize the establishment of Federal mutual 
, V 
savings banks. It was contemplated that a similar reply would be sent 
t o
 Chairman Patman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 
re
sponse to his request for the Board's views on an identical bill, 
H
-R. 10745. 
1/ 
Governor Mitchell suggested, as a substitute for the third para-
graph of the revised draft, language that would indicate that the Board 
unable to judge how significantly enactment of the bill would alter 
Sx -f 
s
 ing competitive relationships between commercial banks and thrift 
titutions nor the extent to which it might divert the emphasis of 
the ]„!.. 
e r
 institutions from the important role they had played in 
na
ncirig the nation's housing construction. 
it*- 
w 
Mr. Partee raised a question whether it would be advisable to 
^
e
8crih 
e
 the role of thrift institutions in financing housing as of 
o v e r r i d . 
ing importance, in the light of the Board's suggestion to a 
S s
ional Subcommittee in May 1967 that study be given to the ques-
tion w h e 
e
ther an increase in the investment options available to nonbank 
d
eposit ry institutions specializing in mortgage investment would enhance 
i-k 
e
ir m tgage lending potential at times when general interest rate

levels are rising. (The suggestion was included in an analysis of 
Monetary Policy and the Residential Mortgage Market" prepared in 
response to a request by the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs 
o f
 the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency.) 
Governor Maisel observed that in suggesting possible approaches 
t o
 the Subcommittee the Board had specified that it did not necessarily 
endorse such proposals. He noted that the critical question was whether 
increased flexibility in investment options would give thrift institu-
tions a better role in the financing of housing. 
Governor Brimmer said he hoped the Board would not come to a 
fir 
m
 Position on that point without careful deliberation. He did not 
subscribe to the view that savings institutions should be used to corral 
Pool of funds exclusively for the financing of housing. However, he 
0 u
ld not like to see them restricted unduly in their ability to shift 
t h e
ir asset mix. 
'k ' ',<•'".'.' 
Governor Robertson then referred to parts of the draft reply 
l n
g to ineq 
uities between savings institutions and commercial banks 
respect to branching powers and investments in equity securities. 
He Su
8gested that the reply indicate that such existing inequities 
Wo u l d , 
e
 Perpetuated or increased if the proposed legislation were 
e n a
cted 
Mr. Cardon expressed misgivings about saying the inequities 
W
°
u
ld bo < 
increased; for example, it appeared to him that the bills would 
Shy. 
i-Cgrio hen liquidity requirements for savings banks. 

1 
7/20/67

Governor Robertson conceded that liquidity requirements would 
be stronger. However, an increase of inequities was to be found in 
n a t
 the proposed legislation would extend the scope of competition 
between savings and commercial banks without changing present distinc-
tions with respect to taxes or reserve requirements. 
After further discussion during which various adjustments of 
la
nguage were suggested to meet the points that had been raised, the 
e
tters to Chairmen Sparkman and Patman were approved unanimously in 
t h e
 form attached as Items 3 and 4. 
—
: 
Nonmachinable items and service across boundaries (Item No. 5). 
Th <

 been distributed a memorandum dated July 14, 1967, from Mr. 
r
rell regarding certain actions taken by the Conference of Presidents 
a t
 its meeting on June 19, 1967. 
One action related to the policy, announced in August 1966, 
thg £ •Ln order to facilitate expansion of the use of high-speed electronic 
equi 
u
 Pment for check handling, effective September 1, 1967, all items 
lackin 
n
8 magnetic ink encoding would be classified as noncash items. At 
the j u n ne meeting of the Conference of Presidents, a majority of the 
Pt^s i H 
e n t s
 felt that the announced policy needed some relaxation in 
°rder ta avoid an unmanageable flood of noncash items, but four felt 
that a 
n y si
gnificant relaxation applied to domestic items deposited by 
m e
mb e r 
a n , nonmember clearing banks would be a mistake. The minority 
fa 
either not accepting any such items as cash items if they were 

7/20/67 
28R5 
'/^U/b/ 
-7-
nonmachinable or accepting no more than a small number--say 25--in any 
°ne deposit. 
{i v., , 
v'r« v \ i. 
The Conference agreed to a compromise under which it would be 
i e
tt to the administrative discretion of each Reserve Bank to determine 
the number of nonencoded items it would accept from any one bank, with 
LL 
ne understanding that the number accepted would not exceed one per cent 
the volume of items deposited by the bank concerned. 
Although Mr. Farrell had some reservations, it appeared on bal-
a i l C e t h a t
 the compromise adopted by the Conference might be the best 
s
°lution to the problem, and he suggested that the Board note without 
i 
\ 
e x c e
Ption the action taken by the Presidents. 
The other action by the Conference dealt with in Mr. Farrell's 
> A 
. 
me
niorandum related to the report of an ad hoc subcommittee appointed by 
e
 Conference to carry out a study, requested by the Board in July 1966, 
A. to ident--i£ 
ncity communities or areas that would be better served by extend-
ing triifir 
C K
 routes or other transportation service across district or 
a n C h
 boundaries. The subcommittee concluded that benefits from ser-
Vi C e 
cross boundaries could be achieved only with respect to check 
l e c
tion and shipments of currency and coin. A study of the possi-
btUti e s
 in those two areas led to the following conclusions by the 
8ub C o m . 
ittee: (1) While there were some areas where check collection 
might b 
e
 improved by service across lines, the volume of items involved 
V
°
Ul
« b e 
i 
too low and the benefits too small to warrant the attendant 
!
-V V i . 

7/20/67 
-8-
difficult 
ies for the check collection system as a whole. (2) The 
Prospects of benefits from extending currency and coin service across 
lines were sufficiently promising in a number of instances to warrant 
further consideration by the Banks concerned. 
The Conference approved a recommendation that the Reserve Banks 
Undertake in-depth reviews to determine which offices could best pro-
vide currency and coin service to the areas identified in the subcom-
m
ittee report. The Conference also asked that reports be sent to the 
Committee on Sundry Operations regardless of whether any changes in 
Se
rvice appeared feasible. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter to Mr Swan 
Cll
airman of the Presidents' Conference, that would note without excep-
tior
* the compromise agreed to by the Conference regarding nonmachinable 
i t e
ms and would request that the Board be furnished copies of the reports 
Of th 
n e
 in-depth reviews of possible improvements in currency and coin 
Se
rvice.

„. 
With regard to the question of nonmachinable items, Mr. Farrell 
°
u
ght out that since the one per cent rule could not be enforced with-
°
u
t a t- • 
time-consuming count of items, which the Reserve Banks did not 
intend 
to make, the rule would be used only to curb flagrant violations, 
governor Brimmer said he would not be in favor of permitting a 
8
it U a t J *Ott in which the operating circulars of the Reserve Banks would 
r e
*le c t . 
a
 certain policy, with no provision for exceptions, but the 
Res e r v 
e
 Banks nevertheless followed a practice of allowing exceptions. 

28R7 
7/20/67 
-9-
Mr. Hackley responded that in conjunction with the proposed 
r
evision of Regulation J, under the title Collection of Checks and 
Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks, both the cash item and the non-
cash item circulars would be amended so that, despite the general pro-
v
isions regarding nonmachinable items, Reserve Banks could handle them 
„ ; 
s
 cash items if in their judgment that was feasible. However, he felt 
e
 might be some inconsistency in allowing exceptions to be made at 
the discretion of the Reserve Banks as compared with the terms in which 
e
 Board and the Reserve Banks had announced the general policy last 
year. 
Discussion brought out that the Conference of Presidents had 
referred to its Committee on Collections the question whether any public 
°uncement should be made regarding the action allowing exceptions. It 
Was 
j 
understood that decisions had been reached that no public announce-
file would be made, nor would the possibility of exceptions be specif-
ica 
y brought to the attention of member and nonmember clearing banks. 
Governor Brimmer reiterated his reluctance to note without excep-
tion th 
n e
 action of the Conference regarding nonmachinable items. A state-
had been issued last year saying that such items would be handled 
as 
n
°ncash items, and as far as he knew the Board had not changed its 
P 0 8
itio n. 
- e 11. 
^ 
' "^ring the ensuing exchange of comments Governor Mitchell re-
v
iewed the alternatives, which included classification of nonmachinable 
'im iv.m 

2ms 
7/20/67 
-10-
items as noncash items or making a charge for handling such items. He 
believed it could be expected that in a moderate length of time encod-
ing would become virtually universal. His own preference would have 
been to charge for handling the items, thus allowing the use of non-
^achinable items at a price. However, the Presidents had chosen the 
°ther course. He was somewhat apprehensive that for a temporary period 
there might be a larger volume of nonmachinable items than could be 
Siven special handling. However, he was inclined to accept the com-
promise agreed upon by the Presidents until the first of the year. 
Th 
e n
, if the problem had not been resolved, he would want to give 
further consideration to the possibility of imposing a charge. 
Mr. Hackley called attention to the fact that the revised non-
C a
sh circulars of the Reserve Banks would permit a collection charge 
0
 be made for noncash items insofar as expenses were incurred because 
t
'
le
 item could not be handled as a cash item. 
Governor Mitchell then commented on the types of unencoded 
ns
truments still in use and the prospect for their abandonment, fol-
ding which Governor Brimmer remarked that there had been a number of 
S tor 1 
e s
 in the press reflecting a degree of apprehension on the part of 
the 
Public about inability to use some types of checks, such as counter 
checks 
> that had been available in the past. In his view, if the gen-
et^ 
Policy went into effect the first of September, presumably without 
cation, but the Federal Reserve privately permitted exceptions, 
^
u
hli c relations problem could develop. 

7/20/67 
-11-
Governor Maisel expressed the view that two questions were 
involved--flexibility of administration, and straightforwardness with 
the public. He believed some administrative flexibility should be 
allowed for the next few months; this was a management problem con-
fr
onting the Federal Reserve Banks. If the original policy statement 
8
a
ve no support to such flexibility, any possible impression of lack 
°f straightforwardness might be avoided by including appropriate lan-
guage in the announcement regarding the revised Regulation J. 
Governor Brimmer expressed agreement with such an approach. It 
m
ight become apparent, he suggested,that four Reserve Banks were dis-
Posed to allow no exceptions while the others were more lenient, and 
t-hat could create an unfortunate impression. At the time the revision 
the operating circulars was made known, perhaps something in the 
nafc
ure of a progress report on reducing the use of nonmachinable items 
c
°nld be given, with an indication that it was expected that nonconform-
• 
i'l 
C e
 would disappear in a relatively short time. 
Governor Mitchell agreed that uniformity of policy was to be 
s
ired, and he thought it would come about naturally as the use of 
Encoded items diminished. In the meantime, he believed the divergence 
8 Reserve Banks in their actual practices would not be too signifi-
cant. 
5jj 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that if some flexibility 
n
°t allowed the entire program might be jeopardized. A great deal 

7/20/67 
-12-
had been accomplished in a relatively short time, and he would not like 
to see any unnecessary risk taken. 
Mr. 
Farrell then reviewed the background of the response by the 
Residents' Conference to the Board's July 1966 request for study of 
•> 
' IV 1 
Possible improvement of services across district or branch boundaries. 
Governor Mitchell commented that in his view the ad hoc sub-
committee's report suggested a great many things that needed to be 
V". ' •
1 
done in the interest of economy and better service. He believed it 
w
°uld be inappropriate to let the matter rest at this stage, for the 
Res 
serve Banks might be inclined to suggest, if anything, only token 
I 
ft; 
Res 
:vv*;
v 
ad
justments. In his opinion there were many areas, going beyond those 
listed in the subcommittee's report, where services could be substan-
tially improved and costs cut. He suggested that the letter to the 
e r
ve Banks state that the Board considered the in-depth reviews ap-
e
 by the Conference to be an important and overdue undertaking and 
that if u 
nad instructed the Division of Bank Operations to work closely 
with the Reserve Banks in evaluating the reports. Unless force was put 
i^d the effort, he felt that the whole program was likely to collapse 
ffe^sfe'V;.; .•'•.• 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that the subcommittee had 
not carri ^ 
e d o u
t fully the Board's mandate. He suspected that the under-
tendency had been toward minimizing the possibility of boundary 
cha 
s
« There had been no response to his specific request for exami-
n a
U o n 
f 
" ^ possible reassignment of a group of counties in Arizona. He 
\\ * t \ ; > v 

7/20/67 
-13-
reviewed considerations that had been advanced in the past bearing upon 
the placement of those counties and expressed the opinion that such a 
question might eventually have to be resolved by the Board. He believed 
there were probably a number of other situations where the placement of 
district line was the real question, rather than merely extending 
Particular services across boundaries. He agreed with Governor Mitchell 
that the Board's letter to the Reserve Banks should be cast in stronger 
terms. 
The 
re ensued a discussion of the long-term approach,to the ques-
tion of Federal Reserve Bank territories, and comments were made on the 
Va
rious influences that had made it difficult to reach agreement on 
c
hanges, although a number of minor shifts had been made in branch 
zones. 
Mr. Farrell recalled that the most recent general study of 
undaries, in the 1950's, had uncovered no persuasive arguments for 
re
districting. The emphasis had then turned to the question of extend-
i n
8 services across boundaries where economy and efficiency could thereby 
'{k 
b e
 improved. 
Governor Robertson suggested that the immediate problem could 
bg y. esolved by following Governor Mitchell's suggestion that the Divi-
S i n
 of Bank Operations work closely with the Reserve Banks in locating 
O p p o r t -unities for improved service. However, it seemed that the larger 
(jues t- -? 
L
ion of redistricting warranted broad study in the light of factors 
f,v
' nil ,.. 
Ovtv 

7/20/67 
-14-
such as changes over the past 50 years in transportation and communica-
tions. 
Governor Maisel observed that possibilities for improvement 
could be sought at two levels--through a study of the need for maior 
j 
• V£v 
changes and through the possible transfer of a number of counties that 
_ seemed to be placed illogically. 
•>•, 
1
 V,.", t ir j . Governor Brimmer suggested that the Reserve Banks might be 
a
sked to explore whether certain counties could not be reassigned more 
i . 
logically. He believed the information assembled by the subcommittee 
v i!*''' •' -
 : 
could be used as a basis for such a study. 
It was brought out that the subcommittee whose report was under 
discussion had been discharged by the Presidents' Conference, and there 
a s
 agreement with suggestions by Governors Robertson and Mitchell that 
• w*»\ -
n e
 Conference be requested to appoint a new committee to look into the 
Possibilities of improving efficiency and economy of services by changes 
n
 district or branch boundaries. 
V- M t 
Mr. Farrell expressed doubt that such a study premised on improv-
the efficiency and economy of services and operations would be pro-
ductive. However, members of the Board commented that when that phase 
the study had been completed the Board could, if it desired, then 
JiSk , 
cnat other aspects of the problem be studied. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, unanimous approval was 
Siven to a letter to Chairman Swan of the Conference of Presidents in 
form attached as Item No. 5.

Revision of Regulation J and revocation of Regulation G 
litems 6-9). There had been distributed a memorandum dated July 17, 
J 
9 
to* 
1967, from Mr. Hackley regarding a proposed revision of Regulation J, 
to be entitled "Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve 
J 
Banks," proposed revocation of Regulation G, Collection of Noncash 
Items, and revision of pertinent operating circulars of the Federal 
Reserve Banks. 
I 
On April 12, 1967, the Board had approved the publication in 
I 
the Federal Register, for comment, of a proposed revision of Regulation J 
that would cover the collection of both cash and noncash items, and thus 
replace the present Regulations J and G. In general, the purpose of the 
revised Regulation was to bring it into closer conformity with the Uni-
Commercial Code and current banking practices. Only four letters 
of comment were received, and it was not believed that the specific sug-
8 e s
tions for changes warranted adoption. Accordingly, it was recommended 
^at the Board now adopt the revision of Regulation J, in the form in 
^'VbA 
l c
h it had been published in the Register, and revoke the existing 
Elation G, both actions to be effective September 1, 1967. 
The memorandum brought out that at its June 1967 meeting the 
n 
n
terence of Presidents had approved recommendations of its collection 
8ubc committees with respect to proposed revisions of the collection cir-
• si.?;.-. 
Cii 1 a r
s of the Federal Reserve Banks. The two collection circulars of 
* • ' 
Banks, one relating to cash items and the other to noncash items,

were to be replaced by three circulars, dealing with (1) collection of 
cash items, (2) instructions to collecting banks and paying banks, and 
'•fttfSP. 
(3) collection of noncash items. In general, the purposes of the revi-
sions were to make the circulars conform to the revised Regulation J, 
to spell out in greater detail the conditions and procedures under which 
items would be handled for collection, and, in the case of the noncash 
circular, to achieve greater uniformity among the Reserve Banks as to 
the types of items that would be handled as noncash items. 
'•^ffi^'v 
The Conference of Presidents also had approved certain recom-
mendations regarding reclassification of items requiring special han-
!,
a§f 
d
U n g as noncash items after September 1, 1967. Conforming changes in 
iW
1
^. • 
th 
n e
 operating circulars would permit the Reserve Banks to make excep-
tions from the policy of handling nonencoded items only as noncash 
|| 
• 
c
ems where special circumstances justified. 
pr i 
Revised provisions regarding protest contained in the proposed 
r
culars were being discussed with the American Bankers Association, 
and it was expected that the Association would adopt similar changes in 
i u own protest instructions effective September 1, 1967. 
The memorandum stated that the collection circulars did not 
* 
luire approval by the Board of Governors, nor need they be published 
in 
the Federal Register. The last section of the proposed Regulation J 
^
r
°vided for the Reserve Banks to issue operating letters or circulars 
e
m i n g the details of their collection operations, provided they

were "not inconsistent with" the Regulation. It was recommended that 
the Board advise the Reserve Banks that, in its judgment, the proposed 
collection circulars would not be inconsistent with Regulation J. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter to the Federal 
Reserve Banks. 
Mr. Hackley, in commenting on the recommendations, said it had 
been learned yesterday that the Bank Management Committee of the Amer-
ican Bankers Association had approved a change in the Association's 
Protest instructions corresponding to the terms of the revised Regula-
^yj'"-J',» j . 
tion j.

Mr. Hackley suggested that the Board consider whether the 
ad
°Ption of the revised Regulation J should be announced in a press 
t e
lease. His own view was that it would be appropriate to issue a 
s
tatement indicating the general nature and purpose of the revision. 
There was general agreement that a press release of such char-
a c t e
r should be issued. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the adoption of the 
re
vised Regulation J and the revocation of Regulation G, both effective 
Se
Ptember 1, 1967; to the letter informing the Federal Reserve Banks 
IfJJ^ 
these actions and stating that their revised collection circulars 
considered to be consistent with the new Regulation J; and to the 
8s
uance of a press release. Attached as Item No. 6 is a copy of the

Bank credit card study. There had been distributed a memorandum 
d
^ted July 19, 1967, from Governor Brimmer attaching a draft of press 
release, proposed to be issued today, with regard to the study of bank 
C r
edit card and check credit plans initiated earlier this year under 
Governor Brimmer's supervision. 
. 1 Mi 
At today's meeting Governor Brimmer reviewed the status of the 
w
°rk in progress and some of the questions that needed to be resolved. 
noted that the Federal bank supervisory agencies had included in the 
April 1967 call report form a question regarding credit card and check 
Ire
ait pla 
ns, and that the Comptroller of the Currency had issued a 
re
lease based on the national bank reports. It was his suggestion that 
ttle
 Board not only publish statistics from the April call but go further 
a n d
 issue something in the nature of a progress report. This was the 
Purpose of the draft that had been distributed. Its principal elements 
tyftv. 
the statistics from the April call, a description of the features 
ty
Pically found in bank credit card plans, the general framework of the 
V being made, and an indication of conclusions that appeared to be 
* He would like to include in the release also an indication 
th 
the Federal Reserve was currently giving consideration to adding

-19-
m' 
a special section on bank credit card plans to its examination report, 
similar to the section the Comptroller had recently added. However, 
the possibility of expressing a preliminary appraisal of bank credit 
AWf'.;:. 
card and check credit plans was a point regarding which he would like 
to have the reaction of the other Board members. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that, since there were 
m a
ny issues involved and none of the members of the Board except Governor 
Brimmer- had yet had an opportunity to study them in depth, no press 
re
lease containing anything in the way of an appraisal should be issued 
a t
 this time. Even if a statement were attributed to Governor Brimmer, 
it 
w
°uld be difficult to avoid the implication that the Board as a whole 
shared that view. 
Governor Brimmer observed that, since it was not possible to 
come forward with a complete, well-rounded report at the present time, 
c
°nsideration had been given to the idea that the statistics from the 
VM 
If 
••-'fVM. 
C a l
l report might be the subject of a Federal Reserve Bulletin article. 
Hr> W e
ver, the task force had been averse to that suggestion. He noted 
tl
*at more meaningful statistics would not be available until fall and 
th 
a t
 the results probably could not be published until early in 1968. 
• 
• 
v
ertheless, in view of expressions of interest from various sources, 
U c
h as Government organizations and the press, it had been felt that 
8 0 m e . 
type of preliminary statement would be useful.

Governor Robertson suggested that the question of issuing a 
Press release be deferred until next week when all of the members of 
the Board would be available. 
. V- • • 
Governor Maisel expressed reservations regarding any public 
evaluation at this point. His preference, he said, would be to confine 
the subject matter of any statement to the statistics and the features 
°f the plans. He suggested that the vehicle for publication might be

a
 Bulletin article, cast in the usual form of a report on a statistical

 analytical project. 
Governor Brimmer replied that, while the possibility of a 
B u
Uetin article had been considered, it was believed there was insuf-
i c
ient material for that purpose. He agreed that the Board as such 
h a
d not yet formulated an attitude, but he believed there was merit in 
Publishing at least the statistics derived from the call report. Also, 
e V e
n if the Board did not favor publishing a description of the study 
£
 a
n at present, questions about it were being received by him from 
t i 
m e
 to time, and he would like to feel free to respond in his role as 
if 
the 
e
 member of the Board supervising the study. For example, Chairman 
Pro 
x
mire of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Senate 
"
;
 '»f V'i r. v 
n
«ing and Currency Committee wanted to explore the possibility of 
L 
aoldi 
-•-ng hearings on bank credit card and check credit plans. In confer-
®Hces -p 
i_ 
tor that purpose, it would be necessary to respond to questions 
Warding the study.

The Honorable Wright Patman, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
°ear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your request of June 30, 1967, 
f
or the Board's views on H.R. 10745, a bill "To authorize the 
establishment of Federal Mutual Savings Banks." 
The Board has no objection in principle to legislation 
that would authorize Federal charters for mutual savings banks and 
thus extend to savings banks a dual system similar to that under 
which commercial banks and savings and loan associations operate. 
However, enactment of the current proposal would (1) furnish many 
existing mutual thrift institutions with an opportunity, by 
converting into Federal savings banks, to enlarge the scope of 
their competition with commercial banks without bearing, in a 
comparable manner, the burdens applicable to such banks insofar 
a s
 reserve-type requirements and taxation are concerned, and (2) 
fjdd still another layer to the already multi-layer scheme of 
ederal bank supervision. 
We are not able to judge how significantly enactment 
~ ^ i s bill would alter existing competitive relationships 
etween commercial banks and thrift institutions nor the extent 
to 
---

which it might divert the emphasis of the latter institutions^ 
rom the important role they have played in financing the nation's 
ousing construction. Both of these considerations seem to us 
of °verriding importance. 
t 
In some respects, enactment of H.R. 10745 would perpetuate 
o
n
e q u l t i e s a m o n g 
d e p o s i t o r y _ t y P e institutions that, in the Board's 
Pinion, are unwarranted. For example, the Board considers that 
i
 e s
tatutory provisions governing branching powers and investments 
b
n
 eq Ui ty securities should be the same for both Federal savings 
/ n k a and commercial banks. This would not be true if H.R. 10745 
enacted in i t s present form.

Paying interest on demand deposits, the Board's Regulation Q 
equires that a savings account contract include a provision 
serving in the member bank the right to require at least 30

 lacking the appropriate MICR routing designation: 
(1) That the previously announced policy of not 
accepting any of such items as cash items be 
modified to permit (a) each Reserve Bank to 
exercise administrative discretion with re-
gard to the percentage of nonencoded items it 
will accept from member and nonmember clearing 
banks up to but not exceeding one per cent of 
the volume of items contained in such bank's 
deposits; and (b) all Reserve Banks to accept 
without limitation nonencoded items issued in 
foreign countries, domes tic-international 
postal money orders, and nonconforming items 
contained in deposits of United States 
Government agencies. 
That no charge be made effective September 1, 
1967, for the handling of nonencoded items, 
and that such a charge be considered justifiable 
°nly if experience after September 1, 1967, 
should indicate that there is no other possi-

eliminating items requiring special handling.

sued by, and arrangements made with, the United States Treas-
ury Department and other Government Departments, the han-
dling of such items by the Federal Reserve Banks is governed

received by the Federal Reserve Bank. 
SECTION 210.4—SENDING OF ITEMS TO FEDERAL 
RESERVE BANKS 
(a) Subject to the provisions of this Part and of the operat-
ing letters of the Federal Reserve Banks, any sender (other than 
a Federal Reserve Bank) may send to the Federal Reserve Bank

permitted or required by such Federal Reserve Bank, such 
sender may send direct to any other Federal Reserve Bank any 
cash item or noncash item payable within the district of such 
other Federal Reserve Bank. 
(b) With respect to any cash item or noncash item, sent di-
rect by a sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) in one 
district to a Federal Reserve Bank in another district, in accord-
ance with paragraph (a) of this section, the relationships and 
the rights and liabilities existing between the sender, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of its district and the Federal Reserve Bank to 
which the item is sent will be the same, and the provisions of 
this Part will apply, as though the sender had sent such item to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of its district and such Federal Re-
serve Bank had forwarded the item to the other Federal Reserve 
Bank. 
(c) The Federal Reserve Banks shall receive cash items at 
par. 
SECTION 210.5—SENDER'S AGREEMENT 
(a) By its action in sending any cash item or noncash item to 
a Federal Reserve Bank, the sender shall be deemed to authorize 
the receiving Federal Reserve Bank and any other Federal Re-
serve Bank or other collecting bank to which such item may be 
forwarded, to handle such item subject to the provisions of this 
Part and of the operating letters of the Federal Reserve Banks; 
to warrant its own authority to give such authority; and to 
a
gree that such provisions shall, insofar as they are made appli-
cable thereto, govern the relationships between such sender and 
the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to the handling of such 
item and its proceeds. 
(b) The sender shall be deemed to warrant to each Federal 
Reserve Bank handling such item (1) that it has good title to 
the item or is authorized to obtain payment on behalf of one who 

§§ 210.12-210.13-210.14 
REGULATION J 5 
has good title, whether or not such warranty is evidenced by its 
express guaranty of prior indorsements on such item, and (2) 
such other matters and things as the Federal Reserve Bank shall 
warrant in respect of such item consistently with paragraph (b) 
of § 210.6; but the provisions of this paragraph shall not be 
deemed to constitute a limitation upon the scope or effect of any 
warranty by a sender arising under the law of any State appli-
cable to it; and such sender shall be deemed to agree to indem-
nify each Federal Reserve Bank for any loss or expense sus-
tained (including but not limited to attorneys' fees and expenses 
of litigation) resulting from the failure of such sender to have 
the authority to make the warranty and the agreement referred 
to in paragraph (a) of this section, resulting from any action 
taken by the Federal Reserve Bank within the scope of its au-
thority in handling such item, or resulting from any warranty 
or agreement with respect thereto made by the Federal Reserve 
Bank consistently with paragraph (b) of § 210.6. 
SECTION 210.G—STATUS AND WARRANTIES OF FEDERAL 
RESERVE RANK 
(a) A Federal Reserve Bank will act only as the agent of the 
sender in respect of each cash item or noncash item received by 
it from the sender, but such agency shall terminate not later 
than the time when the Federal Reserve Bank shall have re-
ceived payment for the item in actually and finally collected 
funds and shall have made the proceeds available for withdrawal 
or other use by the sender. A Federal Reserve Bank will not act 
as the agent or the subagent of any owner or holder of any such 
item other than the sender. A Federal Reserve Bank shall not 
have, nor will it assume, any liability to the sender in respect of 
any such item and its proceeds except for its own lack of good 
faith or failure to exercise ordinary care.

(b) By its action in presenting, or sending for presentment 
and payment, or forwarding any cash item or any noncash item, 
a Federal Reserve Bank shall be deemed to warrant to a subse-
quent collecting bank and to the paying bank and any other 
3 No Federal Reserve Bank shall be responsible to the sender of any cash item, or any 
other owner or holder thereof, for any delay resulting: from the action taken by the Federal 
Reserve Rank in presenting sending:, or forwarding: the item on the basis of 
(a) 
any 
A.B.A. transit number or routing: symbol appearing: thereon at the time of its receipt by

other form of designation of a paying bank (or nonbank payor) then appearing: thereon, 
whether or not consistent with any A.B.A. transit number or routing symbol then appear-
e d thereon.

payor (1) that it has a good title to the item or is authorized to 
obtain payment on behalf of one who either has a good title or is 
authorized to obtain payment on behalf of one who has such 
title, whether or not such warranty is evidenced by its express 
guaranty of prior indorsements on such item, and (2) to the 
extent prescribed by the law of any State applicable either to the 
Federal Reserve Bank as a collecting bank or to the subsequent 
collecting bank, that the item has not been materially altered; 
but otherwise the Federal Reserve Bank shall not have, and shall 
not be deemed to assume, any liability (except for its own lack 
of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care) to such pay-
ing bank or other payor. 
SECTION 210.7—PRESENTMENT FOR PAYMENT 
(a) Any cash item or any noncash item may be presented for 
payment by a Federal Reserve Bank or a subsequent collecting 
bank, or may be sent by a Federal Reserve Bank or a subsequent 
collecting bank for presentment and payment, or may be for-
warded by a Federal Reserve Bank to a subsequent collecting 
bank with authority to present it for payment or to send it for 
presentment and payment, as provided under applicable rules of 
State law or otherwise as permitted by this section. 
(b) Presentment may be made at a place where the bank by 
which the item is payable has requested that presentment be 
made. Presentment of an item payable by a nonbank payor, 
other than through a paying bank, may be made at a place 
where the nonbank payor has requested that presentment be 
made. Presentment may also be made pursuant to any special 
collection agreement not inconsistent with the terms of this 
Part, or may be made through a clearing house subject to the 
rules and practices thereof. 
(c) Any cash item or noncash item, payable in the district of 
the receiving Federal Reserve Bank, may be presented or sent 
direct to the paying bank, if any; may be sent direct to any place 
w
here the bank through which the item is payable has requested 
that the item be sent; and, when payable by a nonbank payor 
other than through a paying bank, may be presented direct to 
the nonbank payor, but documents, securities or other papers 
accompanying a noncash item may not be delivered to the non-
bank payor thereof before payment of the item, unless the 
sender has specifically authorized such delivery. 
(d) Any cash item or noncash item, payable in a Federal Re-
serve district other than the district of the receiving Federal 

§§ 210.12-210.13-210.14 
REGULATION J 7 
Reserve Bank, will ordinarily be forwarded to the Federal Re-
serve Bank of the district in which the item is payable: Provid-
ed, however, That with the concurrence of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of the district in which the item is payable, the receiving 
Federal Reserve Bank may present, send, or forward the item as 
if it were payable in its own district. 
SECTION 210.8—PRESENTMENT OF NONCASH ITEMS FOR 
ACCEPTANCE 
Whenever a noncash item provides that it must be presented 
for acceptance or is payable elsewhere than at the residence or 
place of business of the drawee, or whenever the date of pay-
ment of a noncash item depends upon presentment for accept-
ance, a Federal Reserve Bank or a subsequent collecting bank to 
which it has been sent by a Federal Reserve Bank may, if so 
instructed by the sender, present the item for acceptance in any 
manner authorized by law; but no Federal Reserve Bank or 
subsequent collecting bank shall, upon the acceptance of any 
such item, deliver to the drawee thereof any accompanying docu-
ments unless specifically instructed by the sender to do so. Each 
Federal Reserve Bank shall include in its operating letters a 
statement of the circumstances under which a sender may send 
such noncash items to the Federal Reserve Bank for present-
ment for acceptance, and of the terms and conditions (which 
shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Part) upon 
which such presentment may be made. Except as herein provided, 
no Federal Reserve Bank shall have or assume any obligation 
to present any noncash item for acceptance or to send it for 
presentment for acceptance. 
SECTION 210.9—REMITTANCE AND PAYMENT 
(a) A Federal Reserve Bank may require the paying bank or 
collecting bank to which it has presented, sent, or forwarded any 
cash item or noncash item pursuant to § 210.7 to pay or remit 
for such item in cash, but is authorized, in its discretion, to 
permit such paying bank or collecting bank to authorize or cause 
payment or remittance therefor to be made by a debit to an 
account on the books of such Federal Reserve Bank or to pay or 
remit therefor in any of the following which is in a form accept-
able to such Federal Reserve Bank: Bank draft, transfer of 
funds or bank credit, or any other form of payment or remit-
tance authorized by applicable State law. A Federal Reserve 
Bank may require the nonbank payor to which it has presented 

8 
REGULATION J 
§§ 210.0-210.10 
any cash item or noncash item pursuant to § 210.7 to pay there-
for in cash, but is authorized, in its discretion, to permit such 
nonbank payor to pay therefor in any of the following- which is 
in a form acceptable to such Federal Reserve Bank: Cashier's 
check, certified check, or other bank draft or obligation. 
(b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall not be liable for the failure 
of a collecting bank or paying bank or nonbank payor to pay or 
remit for any such cash item or noncash item, nor for any loss 
resulting from the acceptance of any form of payment or remit-
tance other than cash authorized in paragraph (a) of this sec-
tion; nor shall any Federal Reserve Bank which acts in good 
faith and exercises ordinary care be liable for the nonpayment 
of, or failure to realize upon, any bank draft or other form of 
payment or remittance which it may accept in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. 
(c) Any bank draft or other form of payment or remittance 
received by a Federal Reserve Bank in payment of, or in remit-
tance for, any cash item may likewise be handled as a cash item 
subject to all the applicable terms and conditions of this Part; 
and any bank draft or other form of remittance or payment 
received by a Federal Reserve Bank in payment of, or in remit-
tance for, any noncash item may, at the option of the Federal 
Reserve Bank, be handled either as a cash item or as a noncash 
item, subject to all the applicable terms and conditions of this 
Part. 
SECTION 210.10—TIME SCHEDULE AND AVAILABILITY OF 
CREDITS WITH RESPECT TO CASH ITEMS 
(a) Each Federal Reserve Bank shall include in its operating 
letters a time schedule for each of its offices indicating when the 
amount of any cash item received by it from any sender or sent 
by any sender to another Federal Reserve office for the account 
of such Federal Reserve Bank will be counted as reserve for the 
purposes of Part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) and become 
available for withdrawal or other use by the sender. The sender 
(other than a foreign correspondent) will be given either imme-
diate credit or deferred credit for such amount in accordance 
with such time schedule. A foreign correspondent will ordinarily 
be given credit for such amount only when the Federal Reserve 
Bank has received payment for the item in actually and finally 
collected funds: Provided, however, That the Federal Reserve 
Bank may in its discretion give immediate or deferred credit for 
such amount in accordance with such time schedule. 

§§ 210.12-210.13-210.14 
REGULATION J

item for which the Federal Reserve Bank has not yet received 
payment in actually and finally collected funds.

purposes of Part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) or become 
available for withdrawal or other use by the sender prior to the 
receipt of such payment or advice, except to the extent provided 
in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall be deemed to have received 
payment for a noncash item in actually and finally collected 
funds as soon as it has received payment therefor in cash or has 
received any other form of payment or remittance therefor 
which is, or has become, final and irrevocable. 
(r) A Federal Reserve Bank may, prior to the time provided 
in paragraph (a) of this section, give credit for the proceeds of 
a noncash item received by it from a sender, subject to payment 
in actually and finally collected funds, in accordance with a time 
schedule included in its operating letters, indicating when the 
proceeds of such noncash items will be counted as reserve for 
the purposes of Part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) and 
become available for withdrawal or other use by the sender. 
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, a Federal 
Reserve Bank may, in its discretion, refuse at any time to per-
mit the withdrawal or other use of credit given for any noncash

Payment in actually and finally collected funds. 
(c) Where a Federal Reserve Bank receives, in payment or 
remittance for a noncash item, a bank draft or other form of

°f § 210.9, it elects to handle as a noncash item, the proceeds of 
the noncash item for which the payment or remittance was made 
shall neither be counted as reserve for the purposes of Part 204 
this chapter (Regulation D) nor become available for with-

bank draft or other form of remittance or payment, in accord-
ance with the provisions of this section. 
SECTION 210.12—RETURN OF CASH ITEMS 
(a) A paying bank which receives a cash item from or 
through a Federal Reserve Bank, otherwise than for immediate 
payment over the counter, shall, unless it returns such item un-
paid before midnight of the banking day of receipt,
4
 either pay 
or remit therefor on the banking day of receipt, or, if acceptable 
to the Federal Reserve Bank concerned, authorize or cause pay-
ment or remittance therefor to be made by debit to an account 
on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank not later than the 
banking day for such Federal Reserve Bank on which any other 
acceptable form of timely payment or remittance would have 
been received by the Federal Reserve Bank in the ordinary

any reserve balance, clearing account, deposit account, or other 
funds in the possession of a Federal Reserve Bank, issued for 
the purpose of paying or remitting for any cash items or non-
cash items handled under the terms of this Part, will be paid, 
acted upon, or honored after receipt by such Federal Reserve 
Bank of notice of suspension or closing of the bank making the 
Payment or remittance for its own or another's account. 
SECTION 210.14—TIMELINESS OF ACTION 
If, because of interruption of communication facilities, sus-
pension of payments by another bank, war, emergency condi-
tions or other circumstances beyond its control, any bank (in-

letters of the Federal Reserve Banks shall be applicable to the 
payor as if it were a paying bank, the provisions of § 210.14 
shall be applicable to it as if it were a bank, and each day on 
which the payor shall be open for the regular conduct of its 
affairs or the accommodation of the public shall be treated as if 
it were a banking day for it, within the meaning and for the 
Purposes of § 210.12.

The Board of Governors has revoked its Regulation G, 
Collection of Noncash Items, and has adopted a revision of its 
Regulation J, Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal 
Reserve Banks, in the form published for comment in the Federal 
Register for April 20, 1967. The new Regulation J, relating to 
the collection of both cash items and noncash items, will become 
effective September 1, 1967.

A supply of copies of the revised Regulation J will 
b e
 printed by the Board. It will be appreciated if you will 
^vise us as to the number of copies that will be required for 
use of your Bank and for distribution by you to member banks

For Immediate Release 
July 24, 1967 
* 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
has adopted a revision of its Regulation J, Collection of Checks 
and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks, to become effective 
September 1, 1967. The revised Bcgulation is in the same form 
in which it was published for comment in the Federal Register 
for April 20, 1967. Attached is a general summary of the 
Principal provisions of the new Regulation. 
The new Regulation replaces the Board's previous 
Regulations J and G and thus covers both the collection of 
checks and other cash items and the collection of noncash 
items that are required to be handled on a special basis. 
•In general, the revision of Regulation J is intended to 
D r
ing its provisions into closer conformity with the check 
collection provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and 
^ith developments in banking practices. It also seeks to 
clarify and describe in more precise language the terms and 
conditions under which checks and other items are received 
ai
*d handled for collection by the Reserve Banks. 
WM 
In connection with the adoption of the new Regu-
ation, the Federal Reserve Banks have revised their 
collection circulars governing the details of their col-
®ction operations. The revised circulars will become 
effective September 1, 1967, and will be distributed as 
soon as possible by the Reserve Banks to banks in their 
Respective districts, along with copies of the revised 
• I Regulation J.

Summary of Principal Provisions of Revised Regulation J 
The revision of the Board
f
s Regulation J, to become effective 
Se
Ptember 1, 1967, combines in a single Regulation the areas covered 
b y t h e
 Board's previous Regulation G and Regulation J relating re-
Pectively to the collection of noncash items and the collection of 
check*? 
and other cash items. This combination has the dual advantage 
ay
oiding repetition while at the same time insuring a precise 
t e r
lock between the provisions relating to cash items and those 
6 l a t i
ng to noncash items. 
The revised Regulation J is actually broader in scope than

 combination of the previous two Regulations in that it will

While some of the definitions in the revised Regulation J 
Antecedents in the previous Regulations, the interrelated 
^ional structure of the revision is new. A keystone of that 
8
tructu r e
 is the definition of "item". Based upon that term, the 
te
tn>s •• , 
8 h
 item" and "noncash item" have been defined and are 
Use(
* as the pivot for the regulatory scheme in the Regulation as 
^ u 
a s 
operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks.

 of n c cash items" as one operative term also avoids a number of 
B
anks 
iCuUi e s
 that arose under the earlier form of Regulation J, 
l c h
 was cast in terms of "checks", in that its use recognizes 

the existence of a significant group of cash items other than 
c
^ecks (e.g., the "payable through" items) to which the provisions 
the Regulation and the operating circulars are to apply. 
Other new defined terms in the Regulation include 
II ender", which refers to any of the various entities, including 
Member banks, which send cash and noncash items to Federal Reserve 
9 
B
anks for collection; and "paying bank", the definition of which' 
place on a substantially equal basis vis-a-vis requirements

v
hich a Federal Reserve Bank sends cash items, whether such banks 
a r e
 the drawees of checks or the banks through which or at which 
C Q s
h items are payable. 
With respect to its operative force, the revised Regu-
Ion 
on specifically provides that it shall be binding not only 
each sender of a cash or noncash item but also upon each 
ec
ting bank, paying bank, and nonbank payor to which a Federal 
IvQg — V e
 Bank presents, sends or forwards such item. In so doing, 
Regulation recognizes the authority of Federal Reserve regu-
lati0 n s
 (and of Federal Reserve Bank operating letters) to bind 
u Parti 
e s
 Interested in items handled", whether or not they have 
c
ally assented thereto, in accordance with section 4-103 
of tll e
 Uniform Commercial Code. By virtue of such authority the 
R e
gul a t l

c o
 the collection process: the collecting banks, the 

Paying banks, and the nonbank payors. The foregoing effect is; 
o f
 course, in addition to that afforded the Regulation under the 
authority of the Federal Reserve Act, pursuant to which it is 
Promulgated. It should also be pointed out that the Regulation is 
t o
 have an explicit consensual operative effect upon senders under 
j j 
, 
. 
Se
ction 210.5 thereof, which section otherwise closely resembles 
t h e f o r m
e r provisions of Regulation G and Regulation J with 
r e s
pect to the agreement of a sending bank. 
The provisions with respect to direct sending in the 
ev
ised Regulation are the functional counterparts of former 
Pr
°vi8ions in Regulation G and Regulation J. 
The provisions of section 210.6 are new in providing 
for H-, 
c, 
e
 first time in the Regulation itself a statement as to 
thg ^ration of the agency status of the Federal Reserve Banks, 
Provisions are in accord with the Uniform Commercial Code. 
The provisions as to the warranties made by a Federal 
es
srve Bn L- u 
ank have also been recast to comport more closely with 
thg 
Provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, while at the same 
S u
n n g , by virtue of the interaction of section 210.5(b) 
8tld
 secti 
210.6(b), that a Federal Reserve Bank will receive 
fr
°m e a c h 
. 
sender of an item warranties as broad as the Federal 
R e s e r
v e 
B n ' 
ank makes with respect to such item. 
The provisions with respect to presentment for payment 
®ub antially new, although section 210.7 has some antecedents 
Re 
are 
in the 
M.% 
f
orm 
r^cr Regulation G and Regulation J. The principal purpose 

•4- 
2 9 $ $ 
the revised provisions is to prescribe the presentment-for-
Payment requirements applicable to Federal Reserve Banks (and 
subsequent collecting banks) and, in so doing, to equalize so far 
a s
 Practicable the diverse statutory prescriptions as to presentment 
f
°r payment found in the Negotiable Instruments Law, in the Uniform 
Commercial Code, and in other statutes such as the ABA Bank Col-
lection Code. Among other things, the section recognizes presentment 
place designated by the bank by which an item is payable or 
b y a n o n b
a n k payor; it recognizes direct sending both to paying 
a
^ks and, upon a limited basis, to nonbank payors as well, 
c
°nsistcntly with the theory of section 4-204(2)(b) of the 
Uni
-form Commercial Code. 
The provisions of section 210.8, as to presentment of 
n c
ash items for acceptance, are entirely new in the regulatory 
® ch 
• Since Federal Reserve Banks occasionally receive noncash 
m s
 which require presentment for acceptance or which they are 
tr
ucted to so present, it was thought advisable to define the 
Varies within which the Federal Reserve Banks might act in 
®
a
ktne fh4

 c
«us special type of presentment. 
The provisions as to remittance and payment are generally 
c
orisiste 
n
t with former provisions of Regulation G and Regulation J 
Vtth ch 
* 
a n
Ses, principally stylistic in character, to bring them 
into Xi n 
0
 with the approach of the Uniform Commercial Code. 
Section 210.10 of the new Regulation, concerning avail-
a b
Uity 
o f credit with respect to cash items, is substantially 

si
®ilar to a comparable provision in the former Regulation J , 
alt
h°ugh the new version contains less detail than the former, 
I I l e r e l y d e l i m i t
i n g the scope of the authority of the Federal Reserve 
a n 8
 to give either immediate or deferred credit and the extent 
of their discretion to refuse to permit use of any credit given. 
n t h
* other hand, section 210.11 is entirely new in that Regu-
0 n
 G previously contained no material governing the avail-
y of proceeds of noncash items. The principal purposes of 
I n
S these ..provisions as to noncash items are to provide a 
y with the provisions with respect to cash items and to 
n t
ent to the phrase "payment in actually and finally 
C

n
 addition, the revision is intended to avoid some 
questions which the former provisions of 

Regulation J and the operating circulars left unsettled with 
Aspect to the time for return of unpaid cash items other than 
checks. 
Section 210.14, Timeliness of Action, is without ante-
cedents either in Regulation G or Regulation J or in the operating 
Oculars of the Federal Reserve Banks. It is based upon the 
Pr
°visions
 o f 
t h e
 Uniform Commercial Code which, in effect, excuse 
/
l a y b y a n
y collecting bank or paying bank in taking action within 
111,6 l i r n i t s
 imposed or permitted by the Code if the delay is caused 
by 
' 
at>
y of the indicated circumstances, which in general fall within 
the act 
p 
n 
L
~ot-God category. Section 210.14 is intended to permit any 
^ank t 
o take advantage of the same excuses to the same extent 
not onl 
y with respect to time limits imposed by the Code (even 
though th 
b a n k
 roay be in one of the few jurisdictions lacking 
the CnH v 
e
> but also with respect to time"limits established by 
the 
ation. By virtu© of the interaction of this section and 
seCti0n 
0 t l
 210.12, a paying bank which returns a cash item warrants

P r i a t e
 Parties that it has acted within the applicable

a
8rees to

 indemnify a Federal Reserve Bank for any loss which may

l f l l n e d
 by it resulting from breach of that warranty. 
The provisions with respect to direct presentment of 
warrant-o are new and recognize the existence of a current 
P t a c t i
c e . 
B p (ecause some F-ederal Reserve Banks are now willing to 
to 
*<*ept as C a s h
 items certain warrants which are not payable or 

collectible through a bank and ate treating the nonbank payors 
thereof as if they were paying banks, section 210.15 was included 
its present form. 
. 
Section 210.16 continues, in slightly modified form, 
t h
« former provisions of Regulation G and Regulation J regarding 
t h
e issuance of operating circulars by the Reserve Banks.
