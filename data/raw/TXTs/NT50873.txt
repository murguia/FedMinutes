establish or acquire a subsidiary that would engage in the underwriting 
(through reinsurance) of credit life and credit disability insurance 
Written in connection with extensions of credit by subsidiaries of the 
aPPlicants. Prior to the 1970 amendments to the Act, the Board had 
several times specifically determined that such underwriting activities 
Were closely related to banking. However, the amendments now required 
the Board to consider the public benefits aspects of the activities, 
Which had not been directly considered in previous determinations. 
Examination of the current applications, Reserve Bank comments, and a 
s taff meeting with one of the applicants had raised serious doubts in 
the minds of the staff whether performance of the activities by an 
a ffiliate of a holding company would provide any public benefits. The 
ion r e c o m m e n d e d that the initial p u b l i c a t i o n of n o t i c e of the 
a P p l i c a t i o n s schedule an i n f o r m a l h e a r i n g before m e m b e r s of the staff

Discussion developed agreement with a suggestion that the draft 
n°tice be expanded to specify at greater length the issues to be con-
sidered at the hearing. Suggestion was made that it might be helpful 
t o consult with Dr. Dan M. McGill to identify the issues. 
The Board authorized the issuance of a notice of hearing in 
t l l e form attached as Item No. 3. The Board also authorized the reten-
tion of Dr. McGill, on the same terms as for his 1971 appointment related 
t o insurance company activities by bank holding companies.

First at Orlando Corporation. In memoranda dated January 17, 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets 
Section recommended approval of the applications of First at Orlando 
Corporation, Orlando, Florida, to acquire shares of The Commercial Bank 
& Trust 
Company of Ocala and Citizens Commercial Bank of Ocala, a pro-
Posed new bank, both of Ocala, Florida. The Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta 
believed that the proposed acquisitions would serve to increase 
the applicant's already dominant position in central Florida and 
r ecommended denial of the applications. The Board's staff, however, 
felt that the competitive effect of the proposed acquisitions would be 
°
nly slightly adverse and that other factors supported approval. 
Following discussion, the Board approved the application with 
r espect to Commercial Bank & Trust Company of Ocala, Governor Robertson 
dissenting. 
The Board also approved the application with respect to Citizens 
C°mmercial Bank of Ocala, Governors Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer 
dissenting. 
It was understood that appropriate implementing documents would 
1)6 Prepared for the Board's consideration, and that dissenting state-
m®nts might also be prepared. 
National Bancshares Corporation. The Division of Supervision 
a n d Regulation, in a memorandum dated December 8, 1971, recommended 
aPproval of the application of National Bancshares Corporation of Texas,

San Antonio, Texas, to become a bank holding company through acquisition 
°f shares of the successor by merger to National Bank of Commerce of 
San Antonio and Randolph Field National Bank, Universal City, Texas. 
0 ther documentation included a memorandum from the Banking Markets 
(Section dated January 17, 1972, discussing banking structure in Texas. 
The Board unanimously approved the application and authorized 
the issuance of an order reflecting that decision. A copy of the order 
is attached as Item No. 4. 
First Southwest Bancorporation. In a memorandum dated January 14, 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended denial of 
the applications of First Southwest Bancorporation, Inc., Waco, Texas, 
t o acquire shares of the successors by merger or reorganization to the 
following Texas banks: 
Bellmead State Bank, Waco; East Texas Bank & 
^fust Company, Longview; Kilgore National Bank, Kilgore; and Sabine 
National Bank of Port Arthur, Port Arthur. Other recommendations were 
favorable. In support of its adverse view, the Division cited an 
inequitable offer being made to minority shareholders, and several 
Circumstances bringing into question the soundness of operation by 
controlling group. Also, competitive considerations were believed 
t o be slightly adverse with respect to three of the four proposed 
S u bsidiaries. 
After discussion, the applications were denied by unanimous 
v°te. it was understood that documents reflecting this action would 
prepared for the Board's consideration.

Associated Bank Services. In a memorandum dated January 7, 
1972 . the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval 
of 
the application of Associated Bank Services, Inc., Green Bay, 
Wisconsin, to acquire shares of American National Bank of Green Bay. 
The Banking Markets Section also recommended approval. The Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago recommended denial, on the ground of the degree 
concentration that would result from the proposed acquisition. The 
Board's staff, however, felt that the competitive effect of the proposed 
acquisition would be only slightly adverse and that other factors supported 
approval. There had been preliminary discussion of the application at the 
m eeting on January 20, 1972. 
The Board unanimously denied the application, with the under-
standing that an order reflecting that decision would be prepared for 
the Board's consideration. 
Public interest factors. In a memorandum of January 19, 1972, 
the Legal Division explored the question of standards to be applied by 
the Board in evaluating the public interest factors involved in applica-
tions under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. The 
division recommended that the Board conclude that (1) when the record 
Presented to the Board indicates that there are some anticompetitive 
Effects in the proposed acquisition, the Board should not approve unless 
l t : finds benefits to the public that outweigh those effects; (2) where 
there are no adverse effects, the Board may approve (even in the absence 

140 
1/21/72

°f benefits); (3) in evaluating benefits to the public, the Board 
should consider all factors designated in the statute and any other 
r elevant material bearing on the public interest; and (4) the Board 
m a y consider matters outside the application to determine whether 
consummation of the transaction would be in the public interest. 
In a memorandum dated January 20, Mr. Cardon commented in 
Support of his recommendation against the Board's concluding that where 
there are no adverse effects, the Board may approve a proposed acquisi-
tion even in the absence of benefits. 
Discussion indicated general concurrence with the principles 
S u8gested. However, it could be assumed that the members of the Board 
^
ad these principles in mind in appraising the merits of individual 
cases. There was agreement that it would not be appropriate to adopt 
a formal statement of policy in this area. 
Crocker National Corporation. In memoranda dated December 17, 
1971, the Banking Markets Section and the Division of Supervision and 
R egulation recommended denial of the application of Crocker National 
Corporation, San Francisco, California, to acquire shares of Ralph C. 
A
S-jitr0 Co., Los Angeles, California, a mortgage banking company. In 
S uPport of the adverse recommendations, the staff cited the elimination 
o f both existing and potential competition and undue concentration of 
^sources that would result if the proposed transaction were consummated, 
ic benefits appeared marginal and did not outweigh the anticompetitive

which Mr. Leavitt responded to a number of questions posed by Governor 
Sheehan• 
After discussion, the application was denied, Governors Mitchell, 
Daane, and Sheehan dissenting. It was understood that appropriate 
documents implementing this decision would be prepared for the Board's 
consideration, and that a dissenting statement also would be prepared. 
Reserve Bank management. All members of the staff except 
Holland then withdrew, after which the Board discussed questions 
r elated to 
the management of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 
The meeting then adjourned.

The Fort Worth National Bank 
P. 0. Box 2050 
Fort Worth, Texas

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to The Fort Worth National Bank, Fort Worth, 
Texas, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the Federal 
Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, and to operate 
and maintain such branch subject to the provisions of such Section 
and of Regulation M . 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch will be used for developing new international business and 
not as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
United States. It is also understood that there is to be no con-
tact with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, 
staff, and bookkeeping may, at least in part, be supplied under 
contract by another party. 
In view of the special character of this operation, the 
foregoing permission is granted subject to (1) a continuing review 
of these types of facilities, and after due notice may be withdrawn 
or modified, (2) the condition that reserves shall be maintained 
against deposits in this branch under Section 213.7 of Regulation M 
without benefit of the deduction provided in subparagraph (ii) of 
Section 213.7(a) or the exclusion provided in proviso (1) of Sec-
tion 213.7(b), and (3) the further condition that adequate informa-
tion covering the branch's operations will be maintained at your 
head office and will be available to the Board and its accredited 
representatives. The Board should be promptly informed of any 
modification in the branch's methods of operation, including changes 
in any contract under which services are supplied to the branch. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before February 1, 1973, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date. 

143 
^ e Fort Worth National Bank

Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Dallas, when the branch is opened for business, fur-
uishing information as to the exact location of the branch. The 
Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in loca-
tion of the branch in Nassau. 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits pay-
a ble only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the States 
°f the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt from 
a n y limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 and 
Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve reauirements of Regulation D. The general 
Purpose of these exemptions is to allow foreign branches of United 
States banks to compete abroad with foreign banks. In these circum-
stances, it has long been and continues to be the policy of the 
Federal Reserve System to discourage deposits by United States resi-
d ents at foreign branches of United States banks unless such deposits 
W e been placed to serve a definite, necessary purpose in connection 
vith foreign or international transactions outside the United States. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
fund s provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated capi-
t a l , advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign assets for 
Purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. In view of the 
B°ard
!
s concern with minimizing the impact of foreign investments 
0 n the balance of payments, the above consent is given with the 
understanding that in the conduct of the branch's operations maximum 
Reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the United 
States. Accordingly, it is understood that any investment required 
w i l l be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines as they 
aPPly to your bank and affiliates. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

Mr. Robert P. Mayo, President 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
p . 0. Box 834 
Chicago, Illinois 
60690 
Dear Mr. Mayo: 
The Board has reviewed the "Policy Guidelines for a Program 
to Improve Federal Reserve Interdistrict Transportation of Checks 
Which were forwarded with your letter of December 6, 1971. 
The Board understands that the Guidelines suggested reflect 
your judqment that they constitute effective means for implementing 
the program. Cooperation on the part of the Reserve Banks is indeed^ 
essential, and will undoubtedly be forthcoming. 
In the final analysis, 
however, and consistent with its previous delegation, the Board looks 
•to the Chicago Reserve Bank for the satisfactory performance of the 
Systemwide Transportation Function. This implies that the Transporta-
tion Manager have sufficient authority and support to conduct the 
Function in a way that will insure its success, and that, since this 
is a new program and a novel approach, he will need to exercise 
vigorous leadership. 
In this regard the Board strongly endorses the 
Provision in the Guidelines for the Transportation Manager to analyze 
transportation costs included in individual Reserve Bank budgets and 
to request adjustments where appropriate prior to their submission to 
the Board of Governors for its consideration and approval. 
The creation of a centralized Transportation Staff at this 
time is consistent with a number of other initiatives being undertaken 
b y the Federal Reserve in the payments mechanism area. The establish 
"lent of new regional clearing facilities and the extension of immed ate 
Payment zones reflect a System commitment to ifrove the p a y m e n t f l o w s 
throughout the Nation. 
It is essential, therefore, that the System 
also pursue actively means of improving Federal Reserve performance in 
the physical movement of checks from location to location; in terms of 
expeditious handling, this service should be second to none. 
It is important, also, that we not lose sight of the need to 
consider and modify, where appropriate, " ^ h o d s being used to S 
the 
intra- as well as inter-territory movements. The Board feels that the 

Mr. Robert P. Mayo 
- 2 -
System objective should be to develop a fully integrated and substan 
tially improved nationwide transportation mechanism that will best 
serve all member banks and their customers. Within this context, 
the Board expects there may be an increase in the use of Federal Re-
serve transportation facilities as commercial banks cannot improve 
the quality of the System's transportation arrangements. 
While the Guidelines are written broadly with respect to 
the authority and scope of the National Transportation Function, the 
Board felt it desirable to state, at this time, its views as to how 
this program integrates with other measures directed at improving 
the payments mechanism. Subject to the above amplifications, the 
Board feels that the Guidelines as proposed serve as an acceptable 
basis upon which to develop a Federal Reserve transportation system. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

The Board of Governors has received the following five appli-

surance Company, Phoenix, Arizona. Fourth Financial Insur-
ance Company engages in the underwriting, as " i n s u r e r , or 
credit life and disability insurance in connection with credit 
extensions by Fourth Financial Corporation's subsidiarj ban*. 
The Board has not heretofore adopted general regulatory pro-
v i s i o n s regarding any insurance underwriting activities as closely 
t elated to banking. In addition to the issue whether the above insur-
underwriting activities are closely related to banking, the appli-
cations suggest the need to explore further the public benefits aspects 
8uch acquisitions. 
Among the specific questions in this area is the extent to 
^ t c h permitting holding companies to engage in underwriting credit 
H f e a n d 
a c c i d e n t 
a n d health insurance might reduce the cost of such 
d u r a n c e to customers. As an example, the question arises whether 
^ r c are tax savings or savings inherent in or attributable to increased 
e £fictency in the reinsurance form of operation involved here and whether 

G ny part: of such savings may be passed on to customers. Further 
^
G s t i o n s are whether credit life and accident and health insurance 
be required by the holding company (regardless of from whom such 
d u r a n c e is purchased) and, the extent to which holding companies 
sir?tng to engage in the underwriting of such insurance might be 
Squired to manage their own subsidiaries, as distinguished from such 
^nagercent service being provided by a nonaffiliated insurance under-
• 
u 
, ' _ . t 
V r i t e r i n return for a portion of the total premiums on insurance 
^ t t e n . 
The Board has decided to explore these questions at a hearing 
t 0 b G conducted by designated staff members of the Board at the Board 
Gilding at 20th Street and Constitution Avenue 011 March 24, 1972, 
Winning at 1.0 a.m.

s^ares of Commerce Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the 
sllares of the successor organization is treated herein as the proposed 
a cquisition of the shares of Commerce Bank, 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in accor-
d a U e e wtth § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments and views 
e*Pired. The Board has considered the application and all comments 
t e c elved in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
(I? 
U«S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant is a newly organized corporation. Consummation of 
e Proposal herein would result in Applicant controlling $276.8 million 
Presenting 1.0 per cent of total commercial bank deposits in the State 
Applicant would become the 10th largest banking organization and the 
largest bank holding company in Texas. (All banking data are as of 
ember 31, 1970, adjusted to reflect holding company formations and

Commerce Bank ($264.0 million in deposits) and Randolph Bank 
million in deposits) are both located within the San Antonio 
inking market which is approximated by Bexar, Guadalope, and Comal 
c°unties. On the basis of deposits, Commerce Bank is the 2nd largest 
0 f 
banking organizations within the market controlling 17.1 per cent 
of 
commercial bank deposits; Randolph Bank is the 24th largest banking 
rSani 2 ation holding 0.8 per cent of commercial bank deposits. 
Commerce Bank is a large wholesale bank which competes with 
other i 
large banks throughout Texas and the nation, while Randolph Bank 
i s * small retail-oriented institution located 18 miles from Commerce 
Bank 
c • 
• since 1969, several directors of Commerce Bank have held indirect 
, n etship of 51 per cent of the voting shares of Randolph Bank. This 
*
a tionship has had the effect of eliminating any meaningful competition 
t V e e n t^e banks, though it is doubtful that any such competition existed 
Prior 
. 
L O this time. Thus, Commerce Bank and Randolph Bank do not compete 
den other to any significant extent, and the development of such 
^Petition, in the future, even in the event of disaffiliation, appears 
likely because of the large number of intervening banks, the distance 
lnv( 
'OIVPH 
and the unit banking laws of Texas. Moreover, the slight in-
ase i n 
concentration in the market is not considered to be significant 
l n 
li u 
•^nt of the numerous existing banking alternatives. Accordingly, 
0tl ^ e h 
, 
°asis of the record before it, the Board concludes that consumma-
t e t\ of 
cne proposal would not have an adverse effect on competition in 
L e v a n t area.

The financial, managerial, and future prospects of Applicant 
atl(* Commerce Bank are regarded as satisfactory. Although acquisition of 
^ e Randolph Bank shares involves short-term debt, Applicant and Commerce 
Bank appear to be capable of servicing and repaying such debt without 
Un<3ue strain; the proposed debt to capital ratio does not appear to be 
at n 
a n unsatisfactory level. Future prospects of the Randolph Bank will 
b e improved by affiliation with Applicant since Randolph Bank will have 
G a sier access to necessary capital funds and a pool of trained manage-
m e i it personnel. Affiliation with Applicant will also provide Randolph 
with access to the expertise of Commerce Bank particularly with 
Aspect to trust matters, international banking, and other specialized 
S e rvices. Thus, considerations related to the convenience and needs of 
hL 
e community as well as financial, managerial, and future prospects of 
^
pPlicant and the banks involved lend some weight for approval. It is 
G Board's judgment that the proposed transaction is in the public 
iut 
etest and should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
th 
e reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order 
(b) later than three ironths after the date of this Order, unless such 
p e tiod is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve 
of Dallas pursuant to delegated authority.
