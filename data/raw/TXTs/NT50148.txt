Later, Governor Robertson referred to cases where comments 
were made on the applicant bank's capital position in letters approving 
branch applications. He suggested that consideration be given to estab-
lishing a fairly general rule that when such an application was made 
and the Federal Reserve Bank or the Board's staff was concerned, after 
appropriate analysis, about the bank's capital position or other appar-
ent inadequacies, the bank would be required, before the application 
was acted upon, to state what it intended to do by way of correcting 
the deficiencies. 
It was understood that the question of initiating such a pro-
cedure would be studied by the staff. 
Meeting with Stock Exchange officials. Governor Robertson 
reported that the new President of the New York Stock Exchange and one 
°f his associates would like to meet informally with members of the 
Board at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, September 29, to communicate their views 
°n several matters of interest to them. 
It was agreed that the meeting would be held, on a basis whereby 
an opportunity would be given to Mr. Haack and his associate to express 
t o the Board members their views on such matters as they might have in 
mind but without introduction into the discussion of possible Board pro-
posals for augmenting the regulatory apparatus in the area of stock 
^rket credit.

Officer salaries at Kansas City Bank (Item No. 8). Governor 
Mitchell, Chairman of the Board's Committee on Organization, Compensa-

ing on Friday, September 22, of proposed salaries for six officers of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, approval of which had been 
requested effective October 1, 1967, and stated reasons why he had con-
cluded that it would be appropriate for the Board to approve the proposed 
salaries. 
There was general agreement with Governor Mitchell's reasoning, 
and unanimous approval was given to the letter to the Kansas City 
Reserve Bank of which a copy is attached as Item No. 8. 
The meeting then adjourned.
