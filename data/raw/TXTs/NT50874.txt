Foreign branches of State member banks.

After a discussion primarily concerned with the frequency of 
on-site examinations, the Board unanimously approved the recommended 
Program. A copy of the letter sent to the Presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 6. 
Interest on deposits. 
In a memorandum dated January 21, 1972, 
the Legal Division noted that it was the practice of several Texas 
banks to use a representative who, after successfully bidding to become 
treasurer of a school district, would place the funds with the bank, 
Part in a demand deposit and the rest in a time deposit. The amount 
°f interest paid would be based on the total funds on deposit, but 
the interest would be credited only to the time deposit. Attached to 
the memorandum was a proposed interpretation of Regulation Q, Interest

Discussion indicated agreement with the interpretation; 
however, it was suggested that before taking any action the Board 
should consult the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks and the 
F e d e r a l Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
The Board thereupon deferred action, with the understanding 
that Mr. Holland would arrange to have the proposed interpretation 
referred to an appropriate System committee, and that it would be

similar rule with respect to nonmember insured banks. A copy of the 
letter to the FDIC is attached as Item No. 7. 
County National Bancorporation. 
In a memorandum dated 
December 13, 1971, the Division of Supervision and Regulation presented 
a n application of County National Bancorporation, Clayton, Missouri, 
t o acquire shares of Big Bend Bank, Webster Groves, Missouri. 
During discussion there was an indication that members of 
Board were evenly divided on the application. Accordingly, it 
W a s agreed to defer action until all Board members were present. 
The meeting then adjourned.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
Order Approving Application for Merger of Banks 
Item No. 7 
1/25/72 
Mechanics and Farmers' Bank of Albany, Albany, New York 
(Mechanics Bank"), a member State bank of the Federal Reserve System, 
s aPPlied for the Board's approval pursuant to the Bank Merger Act 
ha 
(12 i .. 
'
 U«S.C. 1828(c)) of the merger of that bank with The Tanners National 
Sank 
Catskill, Catskill, New York ("Tanners National"), under the 
cha 
tvo 
r t e r and title of Mechanics Bank. As an incident to the merger, the 
Present offices of Tanners National would become branches of the 
Suiting bank. 
As required by the Act, notice of the proposed merger, in form 
°ved by the Board, has been published, and the Board has requested 
*ep0rt. 
l c s on competitive factors from the Attorney General, the Comptroller 
Qf t h 
e Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
The Board has considered the application and all comments and 
t C s received in the light of the factors set forth in the Act, and 
that: 
Mechanics Bank ($34 million deposits), a wholly-owned subsidiary 
Bank of New York Company, Inc., New York, New York, the ninth 
t g e s t banking organization in the State, operates two offices in 
city of Albany and two offices in Albany County, in New York's 
Banking District. The Bank of New York Company, Inc., has no 
subsidiary located in the Fourth District, wherein Mechanics 
ranks as the sixteenth largest of 35 banks, holding 1.1 per cent 
Of t K 
n i s District
18 commercial bank deposits. Mechanics Bank is the 
est bank operating in the City of Albany. 
^inds 
The 
U 

161 
-2-
Tanners National ($9 million deposits), the smaller of two 
commercial banks in Catskill, operates two offices in the town and 
serves an area comprised of Greene County wherein it ranks as fifth 
Orgeat of the six banks operating in the county. Four of the five 
competing banks in the county are subsidiaries of multi-bank holding 
companies and are the largest banks headquartered in New York's Fourth 
B anking District. Tanners National is the twenty-sixth largest bank 
i n the District and controls only 0.3 per cent of the District's deposit*. 
The closest offices of Mechanics Bank and Tanners National 
a r e 33 miles apart, and there is no significant existing competition 
between them. It appears that the proposed merger would not foreclose 
V substantial 
amount of potential competition because of the distances 
Evolved and the presence of intervening banking offices. Tanners Bank 
IS TS 
Presently closely affiliated with Catskill's other bank, Catskill 
S a v ings Bank, through interlocking directorates, and it appears that 
c°
n3ummation of the proposed merger would serve to stimulate competition 
severing this affiliation by elminating the existing home office 
^
r°tection. Moreover, de novo entry appears unlikely since there are 
ready three commercial banking offices in the village of Catskill, 
^ich has a population of 5,317. It appears that consummation of the 
Pr c\ 
Posed merger would not materially increase the concentration of 
a n H n g resources in the Fourth Banking District nor adversely affect 
banks operating therein. 

-2-
162 
Based upon all the facts revealed in the record, the Board 
concludes that the merger would not have an adverse effect on competi-
any relevant area. Considerations under convenience and needs 
*
end some weight toward approval of the proposal since the residents of 
th 
6 town of Catskill would benefit by the addition of an alternative, 
f u H service banking facility. The banking factors as they pertain to 
^
e chanics Bank and Tanners National are satisfactory, and the future 
Pr°spects of the resulting bank appear favorable. It is the Board's 
jud 
8ment that consummation of the proposal would be in the public 
^terest and that the action should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order 
(b) 
later than three months after the date of this Order, unless 
U ch period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal 
^
e serve Bank of New York pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FIRST BANC GROUP OF OHIO, INC * 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First Banc Group of Ohio, Columbus, Ohio, a bank holding 
Cot&Pany within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
aPPlied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
l 842( a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares of the 
Accessor by merger to The Ashland Bank and Savings Company, Ashland, 
°hio ("Bank"). The bank into which Bank is to be merged has no 
s i § n i f i c a n c e 
except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of the 
Vofcing shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the 
s W e s of the successor organization is treated herein as the pro-
v e d acquisition of the shares of Bank. 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
a C c o r d a n c e with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
B k J views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
all 
1 comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
°
f t h e Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant controls nine banks with deposits of $715.5 
^ U o n , representing 3.2 per cent of the total commercial bank 
eP°sits in the State, and is the seventh largest banking organization 
i n °hio. ( A H banking data are as of June 30, 1971, and reflect 
°*ding c o m p a n y formations and acquisitions approved through Novem-
b e t 30, 1971.) Acquisition of Bank (deposits of $12.8 million) would 
i n c r e a s e Applicant's share of deposits in the State by an insignif-
^ ^ t amount. Bank operates two banking offices in Ashland County, 
approximates its banking market. It is the third largest of

f i v e banking organizations in the County with 18.4 per cent of total 
dePosits in that area. The two larger banks in the County respectively 
c°ntrol 39 and 21 per cent of market deposits. 
Applicant's subsidiary located closest to Bank is approximately 
1 1 miles west in adjacent Richland County and a second subsidiary is 
located approximately 20 miles east of Bank in adjacent Wayne County. 
AIh, 
^ugh some competition exists between Bank and Applicant's Richland 
atl<* Wayne County subsidiaries, the amount of competition is not con-
i d e*ed substantial. Elimination of this competition as a result of 
S u m m a t i o n of the proposed acquisition would not have a significantly 
*
8 e effect on competition in the area. Some potential competition 
e e n Appli c a nt a n d Bank might be foreclosed by consummation of the 
Pto 
P o s a l since Applicant could enter Bank's market de novo or through 
c^isition of a smaller bank. However, due to the present "overbanked" 
a cter of the market, the restrictive branching laws in the State 
and n H , 
u cher facts of record, there appears to be little likelihood that 
g n ificant competition between Bank and Applicant would develop in 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
Summation of the proposed transaction would not result in a monopoly, 
o e in 
furtherance of any combination, conspiracy or attempt to 
n°P°Uze the business of banking in any part of the United States, 
v°
uld not restrain trade, substantially lessen competition, or 
t o create a monopoly in any section of the country.

The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
f Applicant, its subsidiary banks and Bank are regarded as satisfactory 
and consistent with approval. Although there is no evidence that 
cant banking needs of the communities involved are going unserved, 
8tgnift 
pplicant proposes to expand mortgage and education loans, provide trust 
e*vices and municipal financing through Bank and suggests the possibility 
°f 
Pining additional branches in rural areas of the County. Accordingly, 
COlJgJJ 
•^stations relating to convenience and needs of the community lend 
V eight toward approval. It is the Board's judgment that the 
pr°Posed transaction would be in the public interest and that the 
cation should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
Reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated

Elding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act,

(12

comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c)

hibits Applicant's present subsidiaries and Bank from branching into 
the 
Primary service area of each other, there appears to be little 
^ l i h o o d that significant competition between Bank and Applicant

will ordinarily be conducted in each £ear in which 
an on-site examination is not conducted. Some 
deviation in frequency or variation in scope may be 
appropriate in specific cases, as determined in 
consultation with the Division of Supervision and

continue to be made in connection with examinations

The early part of each year, and before the end of March if at

U Possible, seems the best time to undertake the overseas examinations 
°ntemplated, but examinations may occasionally be scheduled at other 
for operational reasons and to enhance the element of surprise in 
t h e Program. 
Only four Federal Reserve districts presently domicile State 
e<nber banks with full-service branches to be examined under this program. 
^°wever> W i t h the increasing spread of international banking activities 
State member banks, the establishment of such branches by banks in 
districts must be anticipated. For this reason and because of 
p
 G desirability of strengthening examiner capabilities in the inter-
®
tl°nnl area in all districts, the on-site examination program is 
ev>ed as offering a means of providing training and experience to 
J^
m iners throughout the System. Individual Reserve Banks will be 
i°
ntaoted about periodic participation of their examination personnel 
t? °
verseas branch examinations, with priority in the early phases of 
f o
e Program to those Banks with the greatest existing or potential needs 
eXaminers with international banking backgrounds.

Those Reserve Banks in districts domiciling branches subject 
on-site examination under this program may wish to discuss the program 
interested State banking departments, which may wish to consider 
in the examinations.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
5 5 0 Seventeenth Street, N.W.

Dear Frank: 
The Board has asked that a copy of the enclosed draft of 
a Proposed interpretation of Regulation Q be sent to you. 
The P
r o ^ 
Posed interpretation relates to computing interest on a time deposit 
with reference to the customer's demand deposit. 
It is designed to 
Prevent a member bank from paying interest on a demand deposit by 
taking it appear that the interest is earned only on the time deposit. 
The impetus for the proposal was the practice of some Texas 
b j m k s to use a representative who, purportedly acting in his individual 
capacity, bids to become treasurer of a school district and, if success-
places the funds with the bank, part of which are placed in a demand 
deposit and the rest in a time deposit. 
The amount of interest that is 
is based on the total funds on deposit, but the interest is credited 
only to the time deposit. 
There have been reports of similar practices 
involving nonmember banks as well as member banks. 
The purpose of the 
interpretation would be to indicate that such a practice constitutes a 
Payment of interest on a demand deposit in violation of the statutory 
Prohibition against such payments of interest. 
The Board would appreciate any comments you may have regarding 
approach of the proposed interpretation, and an indication as to 
Whether the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation might be willing to 
a d o P t a similar rule with respect to non-member insured banks. 
The 
B°ard would like to give this matter prompt attention and, accordingly, 
i t : hopes that your comments could be received, if possible, within two 
*eeks. 
Very truly yours, 
(signed) Tynan Smith
