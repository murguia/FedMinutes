a review of selected domestic and international economic and financial 
developments of the kind customarily given in advance of meetings of 

JO ' ? ' )

the Federal Open Market Committee. The staff comments were based to 
some extent on materials that had been assembled preparatory to tomor-
row's Committee meeting, and copies of the relevant documentation have 
been placed in the Committee's files. 
Members of the staff particularly interested in the economic 
presentation then withdrew, and the meeting continued with a money 
market review during which Mr. Baker summarized developments in the 
Government securities market, Mr. Eckert commented on bank credit 
trends, Mr. Ettin discussed the corporate and municipal bond markets, 
along with savings flows at financial intermediaries, and Mr. Bradshaw 
commented on the gold and foreign exchange markets. 
Members of the research staff then withdrew and the following 
entered: Messrs. Hexter, General Counsel; Leavitt, Deputy Director, 
and Egertson, Assistant Director, Division of Examinations; and Wiles, 
Economist, Division of Research and Statistics. 
Discount rates. The establishment without change by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on March 25, by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Minneapolis on March 27, by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleve-
land, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas on March 28, 
and by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on March 29, 1968, of the 
rates on discounts and advances in their existing schedules was approved 
unanimously, with the understanding that appropriate advice would be 
sent to those Banks.

Report on competitive factors. Approval was given to the 
transmittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of a report 
on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of American 
Bank and Trust Co. of Pa., Reading, Pennsylvania, with The Peoples 
National Bank and Trust Company of Norristown, Norristown, Pennsyl-
vania, in which the conclusion was stated as follows, Governor Mitchell 
indicating, however, that in his judgment the competitive effect might 
be no more than slightly adverse: 
A small amount of competition exists between The 
Peoples National Bank and Trust Company of Norristown and 
American Bank and Trust Co. of Pa., Reading; consummation 
of the proposed transaction would eliminate potential for 
greater competition between them through de novo branching. 
While numerous alternative banking facilities are located 
in the areas involved in this proposal, consummation of 
the transaction would eliminate a locally headquartered 
bank with deposits of almost $42 million and 10 offices. 
The overall competitive effect of the transaction would 
be adverse. 
Governor Brimmer noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of Phila-
delphia had indicated that the actual and potential effect of the 
proposed merger on competition would not appear to be adverse. 
This 
caused him to raise the question whether all of the Reserve Banks were 
working within the same framework as the Board's staff. 
He understood 
that the Board's staff had had some conversations with staff of the 
Richmond Reserve Bank, and he asked whether there had been discussions 
with other Banks also. 

4/1/68

Mr. Wiles said there had been some discussions, principally in 
terms of the degree of emphasis that should be placed on potential com-
petition. 
Governor Daane commented that although the Reserve Banks should 
be familiarized with the factors considered by the Board's staff, they 
should be left free to present views based on their first-hand knowledge 
of local conditions. Governor Brimmer made it clear that he had been 
addressing himself to assuring an understanding of the criteria used, 
following which Chairman Martin commented that, while discussion to 
promote understanding of criteria should be encouraged, he considered 
it rather healthy to have slightly different judgments placed before 
the Board for consideration from time to time. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland and Kenyon 
then withdrew and Mr. Solomon of the Division of International Finance 
was called back into the meeting. 
Prospective staff appointment (Item No. 1). Mr. Holland said 
that Governor Robertson had asked that there be cleared with the Board 
a proposal from Mr. Solomon with respect to a prospective addition to 
the staff of the Division of International Finance. 
Mr. Solomon said that he had requested authority to negotiate 
an arrangement whereby John F. L. Ghiardi, presently an officer of the 
Department of State, would join the Board's staff on a reimbursable 
loan basis for a period of about two years, with the title of Adviser 

122 7

in the Division of International Finance and with principal responsi-
bility for the work relating to the British Commonwealth and conti-
nental European areas. Reimbursement would be made to the State 
Department on the basis of Mr. Ghiardi's present salary with the 
Department. 
The members of the Board indicated that they would be agreeable 
to such an arrangement, and it was understood that negotiations for 
Mr. Ghiardi's services would be in order. 
Attached as Item No. 1 is a copy of a letter subsequently sent 
to the State Department. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: 
The requirements 
contemplated by the Board's action on 
February 15, 1968, in approving the 
issuance of a preliminary permit to 
United Virginia Bank International, 
Norfolk, Virginia, having been com-
pleted, a letter was sent to that 
corporation on March 29 transmitting 
a final permit to commence business.

Dear M r . Mace: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
requests the services of M r . John F. L . Ghiardi, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for International Monetary Affairs, on a reimbursable 
basis for a period of two years commencing on or about M a y 5, 1968, 
subject to termination upon 30 days notice by either agency. 
Should the Department of State agree to this request, 
M r . Ghiardi would be assigned to the Board's Division of Interna-
tional Finance with the title of Adviser and would have primary 
responsibility for the supervision and direction of the Europe and 
British Commonwealth Section. 
The Board feels that M r . Ghiardi 
could make a substantial contribution in this senior position in 
its Division of International Finance. 
We understand that M r . 
Ghiardi has indicated a willingness to accept this temporary as-
signment if it meets with the approval of the Department of State. 
If this request is agreeable with the Department, we 
would appreciate it if your office could contact M r . Edwin J . 
J o h n s o n , Director, Division of Personnel Administration, for the 
purpose of working out the details of this arrangement. 
The Board hopes that the Department of State will find 
it possible to agree to this request. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland
