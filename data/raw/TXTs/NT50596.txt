Mrs. Byrn of the Office of the Secretary 
Staff presented the usual weekly money market review, prefaced 
by a report on current nonfinancial economic data. Copies of the indi-
vidual briefings have been placed in the Board's files along with copies 
of the statistical charts and tables distributed for purposes of the 
review. 
Discussion related to the staff review included reference to the 
reserve-free base made available last summer when a marginal reserve 
requirement was established on certain foreign borrowings, primarily

of Eurodollars, by member banks. Question was raised by Chairman Burns 
whether the action providing the reserve-free base should not be reviewed 
by the Board, and it was indicated that a memorandum from the staff was 
\

in process which would provide a basis for further consideration of the 
question. 
There was also discussion of the value of projections of the 
monetary aggregates for the formulation of monetary policy during which 
Governor Maisel said that he had on his desk a record of the accuracy 
of past projections that he would be glad to make available to the 
Chairman or others if desired. Comments followed on the uses of such 
projections, particularly those for longer than a month ahead, as a 
defense in detecting incipient excessive tendencies and making correc-
tions. This led to further comments during which Governors Daane and 
Brimmer expressed some apprehension that current expectations in the 
financial community concerning the trend of monetary and fiscal policy 
might stimulate undue credit expansion. There were staff reports, on 
the other hand, that business sentiment, usually less volatile than 
that in financial circles, appeared to be rather pessimistic. Mr. Gramley 
said that he had a paper in process discussing the behavior of the money 
supply and bank credit around cyclical turning points, and Governor 
Maisel expressed the hope that there would be an opportunity to focus 
on the relationship of the money supply to time deposits and the bank 
credit proxy at a meeting with the staff prior to the Open Market Commit-
tee meeting on Tuesday, April 7.

review then withdrew and Messrs. Hexter, General Counsel, Doyle, Senior 
Attorney, Legal Division, and Poundstone, Review Examiner, Division of 
Supervision and Regulation, entered. 
BIS stock. Memoranda from the Division of Supervision and Regu-
lation and the Legal Division dated March 23 and 26, 1970, discussed 
the request of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, New York, New York, 
for permission to subscribe to additional shares of the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements, Basle, Switzerland. 
(In June 1969 the authorized 
capital of the BIS was trebled. One-quarter of the newly authorized 
shares would be paid by the issuer, and the stockholders would be 
obligated to pay in the balance on call. The obligation to pay in gold 
francs raised a question under the Federal statute that prohibits entering 
into "any obligation which purports to give the obligee a right to require 
payment in gold....or in an amount in money of the United States measured 
thereby". The Legal Division had studied the matter from that standpoint 
and had drafted a reply to the U.S. bank.) Manufacturers Hanover had 
obtained the shares in the early 1930s as one of a syndicate of banks that 
took over the U.S. share in the BIS after it has been decided that the 
Federal Reserve would not participate in the ownership of the BIS. The 
New York Reserve Bank understood that Manufacturers Hanover was the only 
bank of that syndicate that still maintained its ownership of shares in 
the BIS.

Governor Brimmer noted that he had considered it advisable for 
this matter to be brought before the Board rather than to deal with it 
under delegated authority. 
He and other members expressed some doubt 
during the ensuing discussion whether the New York Bank was correct in 
its statement that no U.S. banks other than Manufacturers Hanover contin-
ued to hold stock of the BIS, although it was indicated by Mr. Doyle that 
First National City Bank of New York might be involved in the voting 
process only, without ownership of stock. 
Aside from the technical point about the obligation to make pay-
ment in gold francs which Governor Brimmer felt was dealt with satisfac-
torily in the draft of reply to Manufacturers, the immediate request in 
itself seemed to be of relatively little concern. 
However, it touched 
upon policy issues relating to matters such as the appropriateness of 
the continued holding of BIS stock by U.S. commercial banks and, more 
fundamentally, the role of the Federal Reserve in relation to the BIS. 
Governor Daane recalled that some time ago he had asked the Division of 
International Finance for a memorandum on these questions, and such a 
memorandum was reported to be in process. 
The letter to Manufacturers Hanover (a copy of which is attached 
as Item No. 1) was then approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that the broader issues to which reference had been made would be given 
further consideration by the Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.
