Standards Act. 
In the opinion of Board staff, the bill would apply to 
i 
the Board and would (1) eliminate unnecessary advisory committees and 
coordinate supervision over them in the Office of Management and Budget, 
and (2) require greater opportunity for public knowledge of the operations 
°f remaining committees. 
During the discussion it was noted that the Board had two 
advisory committees that appeared to be subject to the bill, the Federal 
Advisory Council and the Truth in Lending Advisory Committee. 
Concern 
was expressed that OMB supervision of the FAC might threaten the inde-
pendence of the Federal Reserve System, and that public knowledge of 
discussions in the FAC might hinder its effectiveness because of the 
Possible unwillingness of its members to speak for the record. 
It was agreed that the Board should make known its opposition 
to inclusion of the FAC in the bill. There was no decision on the Truth 
in Lending Advisory Committee, and it was noted that the Board had less 
concern with the bill's application to this Committee. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff attendance. 
Governor Daane summarized the results of the monthly meeting of 
the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland. 
Governor Robertson discussed a problem concerning Bank of the 
Commonwealth, Detroit, Michigan. 
The meeting then adjourned.
