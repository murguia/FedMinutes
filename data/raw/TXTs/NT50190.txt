Procedure for reporting violations. A letter to the Depart-
ment of Justice suggesting a change in the procedure followed in 
reporting possible violations of criminal provisions of the Federal 
banking laws was approved unanimously, with the understanding that 
upon receipt of the Department's reply the outstanding instructions to 
the Federal Reserve Banks would be clarified. A copy of the letter to 
the Department of Justice is attached as Item No. 2. 
Float reports. A letter to the Federal Reserve Banks request-
ing the submission of summary float reports covering each Federal 
Reserve office on a regular quarterly basis was approved unanimously. 
A copy is attached as Item No. 3. 
Purchase of real estate. A memorandum dated December 11, 1967, 
from the Division of Bank Operations recommended approval of the 
proposed purchase by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond of three lots 
to be used for expansion of the Baltimore Branch. If it should not 
prove possible to obtain adjacent property that would also be needed 
for the contemplated expansion program, it appeared that the three lots 
^ 
-f^.-
probably could be disposed of without loss. 
After a discussion during which the view was expressed that it 
was unlikely that the Baltimore Branch would become isolated from the 
financial center of the city in the foreseeable future, a telegram to 
the Reserve Bank interposing no objection to the acquisition of the three 
lots and authorizing an expenditure of $500,000 for that purpose was 
approved unanimously. A copy is attached as Item No. 4.

continuation of the London gold pool arrangement. 
The meeting then adjourned.

TO THE BOARD

Bankers International Corporation, 
16 Wall Street, 
New York, New York. 10015 
Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of October 31, 1967, 
the Board of Governors grants consent for your Corporation 
to purchase and hold up to 49 per cent of the common stock 
of Bullco Sociedad Anonima Commercial de Mandatos y Financiera, 
Buenos Aires, Argentina, at a cost of approximately US$70,600. 
.4 < «, v .. ' . 1 i 
The foregoing consent is being given with the under-
standing that the investment now being approved, combined with 
other foreign loans and investments of your Corporation, and 
Bankers Trust Company, will not cause the total of such loans 
and investments to exceed the guidelines established under the 
voluntary foreign credit restraint effort now in effect and 
that due consideration is being given to the priorities con-
tained therein. 
Very truly yours,

Assistant Attorney General,

Department of Justice, 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Sir: 
Pursuant to an arrangement made some time ago, the Federal 
Reserve Banks report to the appropriate United States Attorney, to 
the appropriate Federal Bureau of Investigation field office, and to 
the Board of Governors, possible violations of various criminal pro-
visions of the Federal banking laws involving the Reserve Banks or 
State member banks. The Board forwards two copies of each report to 
the Department of Justice. If the Department's copies of these 
reports were sent directly to it by the Reserve Banks, the reports 
Would be received more promptly by the Department, and, at the same 
time, the management of the reports within the Federal Reserve System 
Would be made simpler and more economical. 
The Board would appreciate being advised whether such a 
modification in the reporting procedure would be satisfactory to the 
Apartment. 
Very truly yours 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

°ear Sir: 
The Board has noted with considerable interest the results 
the September 1967 float survey included in the November 30, 1967, 
Report of the Subcommittee on Collections; and also the approval by 
the Conference of Presidents at its September 1967 meeting of a rec-
ommendation that each Federal Reserve office establish procedures for 
Maintaining on a continuing basis float data of the kind compiled for 
September 1967 survey. 
The regular compilation of such data should be of material 
assistance to the managements of the Reserve Banks in their efforts 
o reduce float and could be helpful to the Board in keeping abreast 
the results of such efforts. Accordingly, the Board would like to 
e summary float reports from each Federal Reserve office on a 
regular basis. It is requested that--
1. Reports in the format of the attached sample 
be submitted quarterly, beginning with the 
report covering the first three months of 1968. 
2. Data in these reports showing components of float 
be compiled in a manner consistent with the spec-
ifications prepared in connection with the 
September 1967 survey, but subject to any modifications 
in such specifications as may be decided upon by the 
Subcommittee on Collections.

3. The data reported for each month represent 
the daily average during the month on a 
calendar-day, rather than a business-day, 
basis in order that the information may be 
compatible with that shown in the Board's 
Weekly Statement of Condition of Each 
Federal Reserve Bank (H.4.1). 
4. The quarterly reports be addressed to the 
Division of Bank Operations.
