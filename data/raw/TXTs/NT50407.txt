Foreign banking matter. Unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to Citizens and Southern International Corporation, Atlanta, 
Georgia, granting consent to its continued holding of the stock of 
The Jamaica Citizens Bank Ltd., Kingston, Jamaica, despite certain 
activities of the latter for which prior approval should have been 
obtained. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 1. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of The First National Bank 
°f Quantico, Quantico, Virginia, into The National Bank of Manassas, 
Manassas, Virginia, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the conclusion reading as follows: 
The proposed merger of The First National Bank of 
Quantico into The National Bank of Manassas, a subsidiary 
of First Virginia Bankshares Corporation, Arlington, a 
registered bank holding company, would eliminate some 
competition which exists between them in the Woodbridge 
area and the potential for competition through de novo 
branching. Overall, the effect of the proposal on 
competition would be adverse.

A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Westam, Inc., Phoenix, Arizona, a noninsured institution whos 
only asset consisted of stock of Western American Industries, a newly-
formed holding company, with Pioneer Bank of Arizona, also of Phoenix, 
was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. The conclusion stated that consummation of the 
proposed merger (which was merely a transaction to facilitate the 
acquisition of Pioneer Bank of Arizona by Western American Industries) 
Would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Island State Bank. The Board authorized issuance of an order 
and statement reflecting its approval on February 5, 1969, of the 
application of Island State Bank, Patchogue, New York, to merge with 
First National Bank of Bay Shore, Bay Shore, New York. Copies of the 
documents, as issued, are attached under Item No. 2. 
Governor Robertson, who was not present at the meeting when 
the decision was made on the application, requested that the record 
show that if he had been present he would have voted to deny the 
aPPHcation. 
Nassau branches. Pursuant to the understanding at yesterday's 
meeting, there had been distributed a revised draft of press release 
in which would be announced the Board's approval (on February 18, 1969) 
the applications of a number of institutions for permission to 

628 
2/20/69

establish branches in Nassau, Bahamas. Included in the release were 
reasons for the dissenting votes of Governors Robertson and Brimmer. 
Attached to the proposed press statement was a sample of the 
letter that would be sent to the respective applicant institutions. 
After certain further language changes had been agreed upon, 
issuance of a press release in the form attached as Item No. 3 was 
authorized. The sending of the proposed letters to the applicant 
institutions also was authorized; copies of the letters, as trans-
mitted, are attached under Items 4 through 17, inclusive. 
Citizens Trust and Savings Bank. An application by Citizens 
Trust and Savings Bank, South Haven, Michigan, for permission to 
acquire the assets and assume the deposit liabilities of The West 
Michigan Savings Bank, Bangor, Michigan, was denied, Governor Daane 
dissenting from the decision. It was understood that an order and 
statement reflecting the decision would be prepared for the Board's 
consideration, along with a statement that might be used by Governor 
Daane in explanation of his vote. 
Directors Day. A memorandum from Mr. Morgan dated February 13, 
1969 » outlined a suggested program for the annual meeting with newly-
aPPointed directors of the Federal Reserve Banks and branches. The 
Pr°gram was scheduled for Thursday, March 20, with dinner at a local 
k°tel the preceding evening.

The suggested format was indicated to be satisfactory, and 
it was understood that Governor Maisel would work with Mr. Morgan 
in firming up, within the agreed-upon general framework, the necessary 
arrangements. 
Statement of principles on bank holding company legislation. 
There had been distributed, with a memorandum from the Office of the 
Secretary dated February 19, 1969, a further draft of a statement of 
i ^ 
Principles that might be adopted by the Board with respect to amend-
ments to the Bank Holding Company Act. This draft reflected comments 
and suggestions made at yesterday's meeting on which there appeared to 
have been general agreement among the Board members. 
It was reported that Governor Brimmer, before leaving the city 
°n business, had made known his willingness to accept the language of 
the revised draft. 
Today's discussion focused almost exclusively on the manner in 
which reference should be made to possible dispersion among the 
federal bank supervisory agencies of authority for the administration 
bank holding company legislation. 
It remained the unanimous view 
fchat such authority should be centered in a single agency, preferably 
the Board. The remaining question, then, was whether a dispersal of 
authority, couched in terms of appropriate safeguards, should be cited 
an 
an alternative, although admittedly a less desirable one, or whether 

2/20/69 
-3-
dispersal should simply be recognized as a possibility—not favored 
by the Board—with commentary on how such dispersal might be 
accomplished. 
While shadings of opinion were registered, with one exception 
the members of the Board present eventually expressed their willingness 
to use language in the statement of principles indicating that dispersal 
°f authority was recognized as an alternative, though a less desirable 
one. 
During the foregoing discussion Governor Robertson said he had 
n o w concluded that it would not be feasible, for reasons he mentioned, 
to develop a statement of principles that would be satisfactory to the 
other members of the Board and at the same time encompass his own views. 
Accordingly, he had decided not to join in the statement and instead 
w°uld want to attach a brief explanatory comment concerning his position. 
The method of procedure suggested by Governor Robertson having 
been agreed upon, further discussion resulted in minor amendments to the 
Proposed statement of principles. One change decided upon was to omit 
a footnote table in which the intent was to illustrate how a dispersal 
authority might be accomplished, the reason for its omission being 
the table was not necessary and perhaps would be somewhat confusing. 
The statement of principles, in a form reflecting the changes 
a8reed upon at this meeting, was then approved for publication, Governor 
Rob ertson refraining from participation in it, with the understanding 

2/20/69 
-3-
that an expression of Governor Robertson's views would be attached and 
that copies of the statement would be sent to the Treasury and to the 
Bureau of the Budget as well as to the Federal Reserve Banks. 
It was also understood that before the statement was released 
the Secretary would contact Governor Brimmer and advise him of the 
changes in language as compared with the February 19 draft that Governor 
Brimmer reportedly had endorsed. 
Note: Upon being contacted, Governor Brimmer advised that he 
could not agree with the language that had been worked out with regard 
t o dispersal of authority among the three Federal bank regulatory 
agencies. 
It was therefore decided that in the circumstances there 
Would be attached to the statement of principles a comment reflecting 
Governor Brimmer's view on that point. 
Attached to these minutes as Item No. 18 is a copy of the state-
ment of principles in the form in which it was released later in the 
day> and attached as Item No. 19 is a copy of the accompanying press 
release. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland and Kenyon 
then withdrew from the meeting. 
Appointment of First Vice President at Atlanta. The appointment 
°f Kyle K. Fossum as First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atl 
Aanta, effective March 1, 1969, for the unexpired portion of the 

1/iH 2/20/69 
-8-
five-year term ending February 28, 1971, was approved unanimously, 
along with payment of salary to Mr. Fossum at the annual rate of 
$35,000 during the period March 1 through December 31, 1969. 
Also approved unanimously was the payment of salary to Robert E. 
Moody as Senior Vice President of the Atlanta Bank at the annual rate 
of $30,000 during the period March 1 through December 31, 1969. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Chairman of the Atlanta Bank 
pursuant to the foregoing actions is attached as Item No. 20. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Reference is made to your letter of September 9, 1968, 
regarding the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of Jamaica 
Citizens Trust Company, Ltd. ("JC Trust") by The Jamaica Citizens 
Bank Ltd. ("JCB"), Kingston, Jamaica, without prior approval of 
the Board of Governors, and certain other activities of JC Trust 
AND JCB. 
It is understood that you are aware that prior approval 
0 
the Board of Governors is required for an investment of this 
type by JCB. The Board cannot condone purchases of shares of for-
eign corporations without prior specific approval When such approval 
8 required. However, in the circumstances, and on the basis of 
e information furnished, the Board of Governors grants consent 
° r your Corporation to continue to hold the stock of JCB after JCB 
Purchased all of the outstanding shares of JC Trust, at a cost of 
approximately $11,975, and the acquisition by JC Trust of all of 
he shares of Northshore Convention Hotel Co., Ltd. ("NCHC"), 
Kingston, Jamaica. 
The Board's consent to the purchase and holding of 
ares of JC Trust by JCB is granted subject to the following con-
ations: 
(1) That JCB shall not hold, directly or indirectly, any 
shares of stock of JC Trust if JC Trust at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, 
with the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase 
and hold stock, or if JC Trust establishes any branch 
or agency or takes any action or undertakes any opera-
tion in Jamaica or elsewhere, in any manner, which at 
the time would not be permissible to your Corporation; 

634 
Citizens and Southern 
International Corporation 
-2-
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors your 
Corporation will furnish the Board with such reports 
regarding the activities of JC Trust as it may require 
from time to time; and 
• (3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by JC Trust 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in 
the same manner as if JC Trust were a corporation or-
ganized under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board sus-
pends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of 
the foregoing paragraph so far as it relates to restrictions on loans 
granted by JC Trust in Jamaica in the currency of that country. 
The continued holding of shares of NCHC by JC Trust is 
subject to the same conditions prescribed in the third paragraph of 
this letter except for the substitution of JC Trust for JCB and NCHC 
for JC Trust. 
Please furnish the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, with the Memoranda of Association and By-Laws 
o f JC Trust and NCHC. 
Your letter of September 9, 1968, also advised that JCB had 
opened three branches in Jamaica: One at the Carib Theatre building, 
Kingston; one at "Halfway Tree," Kingston; and a mobile bank "branch" 
moving about Kingston and performing banking operations at various 
designated stops. Your letter also advised of the intention of JCB 
t o establish a branch at Lane Plaza, Kingston, and to acquire another 
mobile bank "branch" to serve the Montego Bay, Jamaica, area. 
Your attention is again directed to the conditions prescribed 
i n the Board's letter of January 6, 1967, which granted consent for 
y°ur Corporation to purchase and hold shares of JCB, and to the provisions 
°f Section 211.6 of Regulation K. In the circumstances, the Board of 
Governors interposes no objection to establishment of the above branches. 
Very truly yours,

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

In the Matter of the Application of 1 
ISLAND STATE BANK

First National Bank of Bay Shore 
1 
ORDER APPROVING MERGER OF BANKS

State Bank, Patchogue, New York, a State member bank of the Federal 
Reserve System, for the Board's prior approval of the merger of that 
bank with First National Bank of Bay Shore, Bny Shore, New York, 
the charter and title of Island State Bank, Notice of the proposed

o f the factors set forth in said Act, including reports furnished 
y the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
c°rporation, and the Attorney General on the competitive factors 
Evolved in the proposed merger,

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY ISLAND STATE BANK 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH 
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF BAY SHORE 
STATEMENT 
Island State Bank, Patchogue, New York ("Island State"), 
with total depo sits of $27 million, has applied, pursuant to the Bank 
Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Boards prior approval of the 
merger of that bank with First National Bank of Bay Shore, Bay Shore, 
New York ("First National"), with total deposits of $43 million.^/ 
The banks would merge under the charter and name of Island State, 
which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As an incident to 
the merger, the resulting bank would have its main office at First 
National's present main office, and would operate all other offices 
the two banks (including Island State's present main office) as 
^ranches. 
Competition. - The four offices operated by Island State 
and First Nationalfs seven offices are all located in the Towns of 
Br°okhaven, Islip, and Babylon, in Suffolk County, Their main offices 
a r e 15 miles apart, and their nearest offices are 3 miles apart, 
Yl—— 
i' Figures are as of June 29, 1968. 

638 
-2-
Offices of other banks are located in the intervening areas. The 
service areas of the two banks overlap in the To\m of Islip, and the 
proposed merger uould eliminate the existing competition between the 
two banks, and the potential for competition from further branching 
of the banks within the relevant market area. Both banks, as noted at 
greater length below, are in direct competition with other banks. 
The relevant market area may be taken as the Bay Shore -
Patchogue area in the southwestern portion of Suffolk County, Long 
Island, some 50 miles east of New York City. This area is presently 
served by 69 offices of 15 commercial banks. Upon consummation of the 
Proposed merger, the resulting bank would rank second in deposit size 
in the area, with 12 offices^ holding 15 per cent of area deposits. 
However, there are 7 other commercial banks headquartered elsewhere, 
x*ith branches in the area, that would be larger than the resulting 
banlc when deposits at all offices are considered. Among these 7 banks 
are two with total deposits in excess of $1 billion. 
A substantial proportion of the area's population commutes 
t o New York City and Nassau County, and thus have additional banking 
alternatives in those areas. In addition, the population of Suffolk 
°unty is rapidly growing and the Bay Shore - Patchogue area is 
tractive for new bank entry. 
2j 
— 
Including a branch of Island State, which has been approved but 
has not yet opened. 

639 
-3-
The Board concludes that the slightly adverse competitive 
effects of the proposal are outweighed by the relevant market area's 
highly competitive nature (which would not be significantly altered 
by the proposed merger), by the fact that the resulting bank (a 
medium size one) would be able to offer more effective competition to 
the larger banks which presently operate in the area, and by the likeli-
hood of entry by neu banks or branches* 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The 
—••*—~—• 
hanking factors with respect to Island State and First National are 
reasonably satisfactory, and this would be true also of the resulting 
bank. 
1 r5 
Convenience and needs of the communities. - The application 
• i • 
•• 
1 
• • 
indicates that the resulting bank would offer expanded services, 
especially in the field of trust facilities, and would be of suffi-
cient size to make efficient use of electronic data processing equip-
ment. Considerations under this factor, although not of great 
height in view of the many banking alternatives already available, 
lend some support to approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of the foregoing 
considerations, the Board concludes that the application should be 
aPproved.

Po 
r immediate release. 
February 20, 1969. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced 
°day its approval of applications of the following institutions to es-
abUsh branch facilities in Nassau, Bahama Islands: 
National Shaumut Bank, Boston; New England Merchants National 
» Boston; State Street Bank and Trust Company, Boston; Franklin 
°nal Bank, Mineola, New York; National Bank of North America, New 
C i ty; Sterling National Bank and Trust Company, New York City;

s°uthGrn 
M 
National Bank of Georgia, Atlanta; Mercantile Trust Company, N.A., 
St, 
L 
°uis; and The Bank of California, N.A., San Francisco. 
The branches are applying for nonresident licenses from the 
au authorities under terms of which they can receive deposits from 
e a s in currencies other than sterling and make loans outside the 
das . 
» out cannot accept deposits from Bahamians or make loans to them, 
cants plan to seek funds abroad to lend to customers outside the 
\ 
a 
aPPli

States, especially to foreign subsidiaries of U. S. corporations. 
"•it* 
X , 
After extensive consideration, the Board concluded that, on 
» establishment of the proposed facilities would serve to further 

the 
641 
- 2-
foreign commerce of .he United States by enabling U. S. banks that 
d° not now have foreign aranches to expand their international oper-
, 
ation8. This decision recognizes as a matter of equity the fact that 
ltlany o t her banks already have foreign branches engaged in accepting 
foreign deposits from and lending abroad. The Board concluded that 
*8teblishment of the proposed branch facilities would neither undermine 
th 
e Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Program nor adversely affect the 
0, e 
• balance of payments. Accordingly it granted its approval to the 
QPPUcation, subject to the following conditions: 
ll ' 
--Operations of the branch facilities are to be subject to 
°ntinuing special observation and review and, after due notice, the 
B°ard's approval may be withdrawn or modified. 
--The applicants are to advise the Board of the exact location 
. .2 O . C'-tii' O•: . 
each branch facility, and when each facility is opened for business. 
y future changes of location in Nassau are to be reported to the Board. 
--The banks are to conduct operations of the branches for the 
Putp 
s e of developing new international business and not as a means of 
*hift1 
loans or deposits from offices in the United States. 
--Any investments in the branches are to be made within the 
totden 
*mes established under the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint 
H r a m . 
--The applicants are to maintain at their head offices adequate 
mation covering the branches' operations.

Voting for this action were Chairman Martin and Governors 
^tchell, Daane, Maisel, and Sherrill. Voting against it were Governors 
R°t>ertaon and Brimmer, 
Governor Robertson voted against the Board's action because 
the Proposed facilities would be "shell" offices with all substantive 
° P e r a t l o n s performed by the head offices in the United States and 
ecause, in his opinion, the Board should not approve devices that are 
Patently designed to avoid the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Program . 
that potentially could be used to avoid the application of reserve 
teciuirement8 and deposit interest-rate limitations under the Board's 
Nations D and Q, as well as margin requirements under Regulation U. 
H^ f i 
e t also that these applications should not be approved because the 
£ 
acilities would not further the foreign commerce of the United States, 
cne furtherance of the foreign commerce of the United States" is, by 
Uw t> 
' 
n e 80le ground on which the Board is authorized to permit the es-
9blUhment of foreign branches. 
Governor Brimmer, who shared Governor Robertson's reservations, 
ai8o 
°PPosed the action because he felt that the Board should not admin-
ister 
Program designed to improve the balance of payments position of 
u"ited Stat es--the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Program--and 
at th e same time deliberately approve facilities of the kind here con-
^Pl 
e d that would undercut that program. Furthermore, it was his 
Jud^ 
that through the operation of such skeleton facilities member 
°uld be enabled to intercept at such facilities Euro-dollar deposits 
w°uld otherwise flow into the United States and thus make a definite, 
P°sittve contribution to the U. S. balance of payments.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to The National Shawmut Bank of Boston,

of the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, 
Bahamas, and to operate and maintain such branch subject to the 
Provisions of such Section and of Regulation M. 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch will be used for developing new international business 
and not as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in 
the United States. It is also understood that there is to be no 
contact with the local public at tie branch, and that its quarters, 
staff3 and bookkeeping may, at lea3t in part, be supplied under 
contract by another party. In viev of the unusual character of 
this operation, the foregoing permission is granted subject to 
continuing special observation and review by the Board and after 
due notice may be withdrawn or modified. The foregoing permission 
is also granted on the condition that adequate information covering 
the branch's operations will be rraintained at your head office 
and will be available to the Board and its accredited representatives 
The Board should be promptly notified of any modification in the 
^ranch's methods of operation, including changes in any contract 
under which services are supplied to the branch. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened 
tor business on or before March 1, 1970, all rights granted 
hereby shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority 
ereby granted will automatical1}' terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
eserve Bank of Boston, when the branch is opened for business, 
urnishing information as to the exact location of the branch, 
he Board should also be promptly informed of any future change 
n location of the branch in Nassau.

As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the 
form of allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be 
regarded as foreign assets for purposes of the foreign credit 
restraint effort. In view of the Board's concern with minimizing 
the impact of foreign investments or. the balance of payments, the 
above consent is given with the understanding that in the conduct 
of the branch's operations maximum reliance will be placed on 
resources obtained outside the United States. Accordingly, it 
is understood that any investment required will be made within 
the guidelines established under the foreign credit restraint 
effort now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending and 
investment activities of your bank arid Shawmut International 
Corporation, and that due consideration is being given to the 
priorities contained therein.

Item No. 18 
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES 
2/20/69 
BY THE 
BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WITH RESPECT TO 
AMENDMENTS TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT 
For several months the Board of Governors has been engaged in 
an intensive study of the problems presented by the recent trend in the 
formation of one-bank holding companies. The Board's deliberations have 
led it to adopt the following statement of principles with respect to 
Possible amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: 
1. The Board believes that it is essential that one-bank hold-
ing companies be included within the purview of the Act. 
2. The Board considers that under present circumstances the 
law should not permit a bank to become a part of a con-
glomerate organization. The unique characteristics of 
banks led the Congress in 1933 to separate banking from non-
banking businesses, and in 1956 to reinforce that policy by 
limiting the activities of multibank holding companies to 
the management and control of banks and closely related 
activities. The Board believes that this separation should 
be maintained. 
It also believes, however, that, consistent with con-
tinued growth and development of a dynamic and increasingly 
complex economy, banks should be granted greater freedom to 
innovate new services and procedures, either directly, or 
through wholly-owned subsidiaries, or through affiliates in 
a holding company system, subject to administrative approval 
of entry and acquisitions to prevent activities inconsistent 
with the purpose of the Act. 

Certain kinds of activities in holding company systems are 
in the public interest if accompanied by proper safeguards 
against perverse consequences. In determining whether a 
particular activity by bank holding company organizations 
is consistent with the public interest, consideration must 
be given to whether the benefits of such affiliation out-
weigh the potential dangers at which the separation of 
banking from nonbanking businesses has been directed. Such 
benefits would include greater convenience to the public, 
increased competition, and gains in efficiency for the 
economy generally as well as for the holding company organ-
ization. The potential dangers which might result from bank 
affiliation with nonbanking businesses are undue concentra-
tion of resources, decreased competition, conflicts of 
interest leading to less equality in the availability of 
credit, and dangers to the soundness of the nation's banking 
business. 
The Board considers that one-bank holding companies and 
multibank holding companies should be afforded equal treat-
ment under the law with respect to bank and nonbank acquisi-
tions or approvals of de novo entry. 
Bank holding companies should be allowed to enter certain 
nonbanking areas of activity, specified in statute or agency 
regulation, which would facilitate broader services for the 
public. Determinations by the appropriate banking agency 
would involve an evaluation of the benefits and dangers of 

-3-
673 
such entry. Unless otherwise provided by law, entry by 
acquisition, purchase of assets, merger, consolidation, or 
otherwise should be on the basis of considerations similar 
to the competitive and banking factors contained in the 
present Act.-^ 
6. The Board believes that it would be most effective for one 
agency (preferably the Board) to continue to administer the 
Bank Holding Company Act with respect to the holding 
companies themselves and with respect to the approval of 
acquisitions by the holding companies. Just as it believes 
the present system of a single agency determining the approval 
of new acquisitions by holding companies is proper, the Board 
believes that the acquisition of subsidiaries by individual 
banks should be dispersed among the three bank regulatory 
agencies. 
7. Alternatively, and less desirably, if the Bank Holding Company 
Act were to be amended so that administrative authority over 
bank holding companies would be dispersed among the three 
agencies which now share in the regulation of banks, dispersion 
1/ Because of the risk of undue concentration of resources, an 
aPPlicant proposing an acquisition involving a relatively large amount 
nonbank assets would ordinarily bear a greater burden of proving that 
e acquisition was not contrary to the public interest. 
Any expansion of bank holding company activities is predicated 
the assumption that the economy generally will also benefit from the 
ility of such institutions to operate more efficiently in performing 
ttain functions. However, it should be recognized that entry into 
v activities particularly those that are financially related--
ether de novo or by acquisition—raises the question of the effect on 
^Petition between bank and nonbank institutions. Preserving the 
aHlity of such competition may be of overriding importance. The 
obability of anticompetitive consequences appears greater in acquisi-
°ns of existing concerns than in de novo entry. 

674 
might occur in the following manner: 
(a) Vest authority over multibank holding company 
acquisitions of banks and of nonbanking activities 
in the Board. 
(b) Disperse authority over one-bank holding companies 
in the three agencies with a requirement that regula-
tions be jointly promulgated as to permitted nonbank 
lines of activity and containing guidelines as to 
acquisitions and mergers which because of 
s ize, or 
market, or related activities would be presumed to be 
opposed to the public interest. These regulations 
would also be applicable to nonbank acquisitions by 
multibank holding companies. 
8. Although one-bank holding companies should generally be 
subject to the Act to the same extent as multibank holding 
companies, one-bank holding companies in existence before 
the recent trend to their formation should be given special 
consideration. This would mean a qualified exemption for 
those companies with respect to which the Congress or the 
agency determines that the combination of bank and nonbank 
assets does not give rise to any significant extent to the 
2/ 
evils at which the Act is directed.— 
> 
2/ There are various possible forms such an exemption might take: 
^ exempting one-bank holding companies with relatively small bank and 
£°nbank assets; (2) exempting one-bank holding companies in existence 
e*ore the recent trend began (generally accepted as July 1, 1968) as 
as they conduct no activities other than those conducted on the 
t-off date and do not acquire (by purchase of assets, merger, consoli-
ation, or otherwise) any interest in any other Enterprise; (3) exempting 
uch companies irrespective of their activities as long as they make no 
Cclui8itions; and (4) exempting such companies irrespective of their 
tivities or acquisitions but require agency approval of any acquisition. 

675 
-5-
NOTE: This statement of principles is directed to 
the major issues involved in bringing one-bank holding 
companies within the coverage of the Bank Holding 
Company Act. Other amendments to the Act also merit 
favorable action by Congress. Among these are amend-
ments (1) to bring partnerships within the coverage of 
the Act; (2) to broaden the Board's authority to deter-
mine that a company owns or controls a bank; (3) to give 
the Board jurisdiction over mergers where the resulting 
bank is a subsidiary of a multibank holding company; 
(4) to prohibit a bank from voting bank stock held in 
trust unless it has voting instructions from the 
beneficiary; and (5) prohibit tie-in arrangements. 

676 
STATEMENT OF VIEWS OF GOVERNOR ANDREW F. BRIMMER 
Governor Brimmer is in agreement with all elements of the 
Board's statement of principles regarding bank holding companies 
except for Item 7 regarding dispersal of authority among the three 
Federal bank regulatory agencies. He believes as a matter of 
principle that the administrative authority under the Bank Holding 
Company Act should be vested in a single agency. 
STATEMENT OF VIEWS OF GOVERNOR J, L. ROBERTSON 
Governor Robertson did not join in this statement. His 
views on the major issues involved are: (1) one-bank holding 
companies should be brought within the coverage of the Bank Holding 
Company Act without a "grandfather clause" (although small one-bank 
holding companies might be given special consideration); and (2) 
some expansion of the powers of banks through subsidiary corporations 
or through collateral affiliates in a holding company system is justi-
fied; but (3) the most important consideration is that the administra-
tion of the Holding Company Act should be vested in one Federal agency 
to assure uniformity in its application, which is essential from the 
standpoints of the banking community, the Government, and the public.
