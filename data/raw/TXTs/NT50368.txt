draft. 
The entry was now presented for approval by the Board. 
U p o n d i s t r i b u t i o n of the preliminary draft, one of the Commit-
tee members (Mr. H i c k m a n ) had suggested stating that a m i n o r i t y of the 
Committee advocated "moderately firmer m o n e y m a r k e t conditions" 
instead of "at least a slight increase in m o n e t a r y restraint." 
It 
w a s the v i e w of the Board m e m b e r s that the original language was 
Preferable and should be reinstated. 
It was noted that those Corn-
e t tee m e m b e r s w h o voted in the m i n o r i t y , including M r . H i c k m a n , were 
free to express their reasons in a later part of the entry. 
The entry was then approved unanimously, subject to the change 
noted. it was understood that it would be distributed to the Reserve 
Bank Presidents primarily for information but with an indication of 
the date by which any further comments should be received. It was 
contemplated that the entry would be released to the press about
