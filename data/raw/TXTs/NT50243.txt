interposing no objection to a change in title

In connection with Item No. 3, Mr. Sanders (Legal Division) 
said a suggestion had been made that the Board might refer to the 
Uniform Consumer Credit Code being prepared by the National Conference 
of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. 
In testimony on the pending 
truth in lending legislation, the Board had indicated that it hoped 
enactment of such legislation at the Federal level would prompt States 
to pass similar legislation so that after a period of years the need 
for Federal legislation and regulation would be reduced to a minimum

since it was anticipated that disclosure with respect to credit trans-
actions in States adopting the code would be governed by State rather 
than Federal law and regulation. However, work on the Uniform Code 
had not yet been completed and there would be nothing specific to 
recommend to the States for adoption. This, plus the fact that the 
truth in lending legislation had not yet been enacted, led Mr. Sanders 
to recommend that no mention be made of the Uniform Consumer Credit 
Code at this time. There was agreement with Mr. Sanders' recommendation 
Policy record entry. With a memorandum from Mr. Broida dated 
March 20, 1968, there had been distributed a draft of policy record 
entry covering the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on 
January 9, 1968, as revised to take account of comments received 
following distribution of a preliminary draft. During consideration of 
the proposed entry at the meeting on March 22, 1968, additional sugges-
tions were made, and in a memorandum of the same date Mr. Broida 
presented proposed changes that would take account of those suggestions. 
The entry was now submitted for approval by the Board for 
inclusion in its Annual Report for 1968. If approved, the entry would 
be distributed to the Reserve Bank Presidents, primarily for informa-
tion but with an indication of the date by which any further comments 
should be submitted. The entry would be released about April 8, 1968. 
Subject to clearance of the proposed changes with members of 
the Board who were not present at today's meeting, the entry was

approved for inclusion in the Annual Report. 
Financial support for statistical series. There had been 
distributed a memorandum dated March 19, 1968, from Mr. Brill relating 
to a request from the Department of Commerce for Reserve Bank finan-
cial support (in the amount of about $50,000 a year for two years 
beginning July 1, 1968) for the continuation of a quarterly statistical 
series on personal income by States compiled by the Office of Business 
Economics. The System Research Advisory Committee supported, by split 
vote, the financing of the series and had referred the question to the 
Conference of Presidents, which agreed that the Reserve Banks should 
provide the requested support for a temporary period. The Board's 
staff had little direct interest in these statistics, but some Reserve 
Banks found them of value. 
If the Board approved the action of the 
Conference of Presidents, it was recommended that the Controller be 
authorized to enter into a contract with the Department of Commerce, 
making periodic payments to that agency and billing the Reserve Banks 
for their pro rata shares. 
The action of the Conference of Presidents was approved unani-
mously, and the Controller was authorized to enter into the contract 
with the Department of Commerce. 
The meeting then adjourned.

today approved on behalf of the Board 
the following items:

of that Division for a period of approximately one year beginning 
about mid-June 1968.
