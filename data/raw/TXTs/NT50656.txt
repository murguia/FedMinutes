a
 draft letter reflecting this recommendation. 
Questions were raised as to the nature of branch activities

With branches in London and continental Europe would want also to

a
ttempt to develop additional information along those lines.

The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Reserve requirements. 
In a memorandum dated July 28, 1970, 
the Division of Research and Statistics suggested that consideration 
be given to a reduction in reserve requirements as a means of pro-
viding an increase in the liquidity of all commercial banks and that 
the effect be moderated through imposition of reserve requirements 
commercial paper. 
(A proposed amendment to Regulation D, Reserves 
°f Member Banks, that would apply reserve requirements to certain 
types of bank-related commercial paper had been published for comment 
m January but had not been finally acted upon.) 
The following documents dealing with the general subject had 
also been distributed: 
Memorandum from the Division of Research and Statistics 
dated April 20, 1970, regarding the application of Regula-
tion D to bank-related commercial paper; 
Memorandum from the Division of Research and Statistics 
dated May 13, 1970, discussing the question of boundaries 
between banks and their affiliates; 
Memorandum from Messrs. Solomon and Gemmill dated June 9, 
1970, relating to reserve requirements on commercial paper; 
and 
Memorandum from the Legal Division, dated June 9, 1970, 
regarding commercial paper issued by bank subsidiaries.

At today's meeting Chairman Burns expressed the wish to 
discuss further, with a view to early action, his previously defined 
proposal that (1) a reserve requirement of 4-1/2 per cent be imposed 
on bank-related commercial paper, and (2) the reserve requirement on 
time deposits over $5 million be reduced from 6 to 4-1/2 per cent, 
the actions to be taken simultaneously. An argument against the 
imposition of reserve requirements on bank-related commercial paper 
had been the restrictiveness of the action, but the parallel actions 
suggested would deal with that difficulty. A second argument in 
favor of his proposal stemmed from the slow but definite erosion of 
System membership, which he understood was attributable in large 
measure to reserve requirements. 
He also was of the view that the 
economic climate was appropriate for such a move at this time. 
In 
addition, there was a strong feeling in the country, whether or not 
Justified, that the System was pursuing a tight credit policy. 
Bank 
indebtedness to the Federal Reserve System had risen, and interest 
r
ates seemed to him disconcertingly high. A release of reserves 
s
hould serve the purpose of enabling banks to buy mortgages and State 
a
n d local government issues, the areas in which improvement was needed 
to bolster the economy now that the capital expenditures boom had 
ended. 
Mr. Partee expressed the view that, for reasons set forth in 
a
 staff memorandum dated August 13, 1970, (distributed at the meeting), 

8/13/70 
-7-
economic and financial arguments weighed on the side of making a cut 
in reserve requirements. Also, the suggested combination would not 
raise total required reserves significantly for any group of banks. 
(A distributed table showed the reserve impact of the proposal among 
various classes of banks.) 
Chairman Burns pointed out that the proposal would result in a 
virtual stand-off for New York City banks. 
The degree of easing that 
would occur in total would depend to large extent on the decisions of 
the Federal Open Market Committee. 
If the Board decided to take the 
Proposed action, the Committee should be apprised of the fact at its 
next meeting in order that the action might be taken into account in 
the Committee's deliberations. 
He would view the proposed action as 
beneficial psychologically and helpful to the Committee in attaining 
its desired objectives. 
Governor Mitchell stated that he was not alarmed by the size 
°f the proposed reduction, although he did have some hesitancy about 
the cut for country banks as compared with reserve city banks, par-
ticularly since large country banks would be the chief beneficiaries. 
He would prefer not to tackle the question of demand deposits, which 
in his view, should be restructured. 
Governor Mitchell inquired whether there would be any 
significant loopholes with respect to commercial paper that could not 
k
e
 reached, and the staff agreed that certain loopholes would exist. 

2320 
8/13/70 
-8-
To meet this problem it had been suggested that the Board's announcement 
with respect to reserve requirements might be accompanied by a state-
ment urging banks to abide by the spirit of the regulation. 
It was 
also suggested that some of the loopholes could be closed if the Board 
adopted a proposed amendment to Regulation Q, Interest on Deposits, 
that had been published in the Federal Register for comment on November 5, 
1969. 
However, comments reflected some sentiment in favor of confining 
attention to Regulation D. 
Governor Maisel stated that he would prefer a more neutral move, 
such as reduction of the reserve requirements on time deposits over $5 
million from 6 per cent to 5 per cent and the imposition of a 5 per 
cent reserve requirement on bank-related commercial paper. 
He was not 
Persuaded that erosion of System membership would be slowed down through 
the reserve requirement move. 
Governor Robertson stated that he continued to favor putting 
commercial paper and large certificates of deposit on the same basis, 
w
ith respect to both Regulations Q and D . Arguments made in the past 
for not applying Regulation Q were in his opinion no longer valid since 
the Board had lifted the ceiling on 30-89 day deposits of $100,000 or 
more. Like other members of the Board, he noted that the present pro-
posal would benefit principally the large country banks. 
He would 
like to see a stand-off at New York City banks, and he wondered whether 
a n
 adjustment of reserve requirements against demand deposits might not 
d o
 a better job of maintaining essentially a neutral position. 

8/13/70 
-9-
Following further discussion during which other possible 
variations of a reserve requirement move were suggested, it was 
understood that the staff would develop estimates reflecting the 
approximate reserve effects thereof and that the matter would then 
be considered at greater length. 
The meeting then adjourned.

APPLICATION BY 
MARINE MIDLAND GRACE TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH

Marine Midland Grace Trust Company of New York, New York,

h a s
 applied, pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), 
the Board's prior approval of the merger of that bank with 
T h e
 Community Bank, Lynbrook, New York ("Community Bank"), which

The banks would merge

t o
 open a branch in Carle Place, also in Nassau County. Marine Grace 
i s
 the eighth largest bank in New York City. The 12 banks controlled 
by Marine Midland hold 6 per cent of the total bank deposits in the 
State, making the holding company the State's seventh largest banking 
o r
ganization. With the exceptions of Marine Grace and Marine Midland 
Tinker National Bank, East Setauket, Suffolk County ("Marine Tinker"), 
Marine Midland's bank subsidiaries are located in upstate New York. 
Community Bank operates its head office and a drive-in branch 
i n L
ynbrook and a branch in West Hempstead; the bank derives the bulk 
its business from these communities and from East Rockaway, Rockville 
C e
n t r e , Malverne and Valley Stream, all of which are in southwestern 
Nassau County. Community Bank with 7.5 per cent of the deposits, is 
t l l e S m
allest of nine banks that operate 19 offices in this area; five of 
hL 
e
 other banks are large New York City-based institutions. 
The nearest office of Marine Grace to Community Bank are 
branches in central Queens County and in Jericho, which are, respec-
t i v e ^ 12 and nine miles distant; numerous banking alternatives inter-
V e n e
« 
The proposed Carle Place branch of Marine Grace will be five 
northeast of West Hempstead, and separated from the latter by 
c
°ngested residential and commercial region. The nearest office 
0 f
 Marine Tinker to an office of Community Bank is at Brentwood, thirty 
m l l e

The proposed merger would not eliminate any meaningful 
listing competition. 
State law permits de novo entry into Nassau

County by New York City-based banks, but the home-office-protection 
feature of State law precludes Marine Grace from establishing a new 
branch in Lynbrook, The proposed merger would open Lynbrook to 
novo entry by other banks. 
The effect of the merger on competition would be no more 
than slightly adverse. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The 
banking factors with respect to each of the banks proposing to 
I i l e r
«
e
 are satisfactory, as they would be with respect to the 
S u i t i n g bank. 
Convenience and needs of the community. - It does not 
a
ppear that there is any important need for banking services in 
t . L 
e
 area served by Community Bank that is not being met with 
r e
asonable convenience. 
However, the proposed merger would pro-
vide a convenient alternative source of full banking services for 
the customers of Community Bank, and open the Lynbrook community 
to H 
novo branching. 
Summary and conclusion. - In the judgment of the Board, 
^•be e f f e c t of the proposed merger on competition would be no more 
t
ban slightly adverse and would be offset by benefits to the bank-
convenience and needs of the area served by Community Bank. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the application 
S h o
" l d be approved.

The proposal is designed as a first step by the Trust in 
c
omplyi ng with the 1966 amendments to the Act, which require that the 
T r u s t
> by July 1, 1971, either cease to be a bank holding company or 
C o n
f o r m to the prohibitions of the Act against ownership of non-banking 
*
n t
erests by a bank holding company. Consummation of the proposed 
t r
ansaction will not, in itself, terminate the status of the Trust as a 
b a n k
 folding company, since it will control Applicant as a result of its 
t G c
e i p t of shares of Applicant in exchange for the bank shares which the 
Trvi 
s
t now owns. Compliance by the Trust with the provisions of the Act 
^ill require that subsequently, but in any event prior to July 1, 1971, 
i t :
 eliminate any and all relationships with Applicant which would enable 
it t 
0
 exercise, with respect to Applicant and/or its subsidiary banks, a 
0 r
*trolli ng influence prohibited by the Act to a company which is not a 
holding company. Therefore, while the present proposal would appear 
0
 M i l i t a t e an orderly divestiture of the subject banks by the Trust, 
t s
 consummation will not immediately effectuate such divestiture. 
That 
depend upon the effectiveness of the subsequent steps taken by the 

2 3 3 5 
- 5 -
Trust, including a sale to the public of any shares of Applicant which 
would enable the Trust to exercise prohibited control over Applicant or 
its subsidiary banks. 
The effectiveness of the subsequent steps taken to 
accomplish the statutory requirements will, of course, be a subject of 
continuing interest to the Board in the performance of its responsibilities 
under the A c t . 
Views and recommendations of supervisory authorities. -
A s
 required by section 3(b) of the A c t , the Board gave written notice 
receipt of the application to the Comptroller of the Currency and 
Florida Commissioner of Banking, and requested their views and 
r
°commendations. 
The Comptroller offered no objection to the proposal, 
and the Commissioner recommended approval of the application, as it 
r e
lates to banks under his supervision. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
^ a t the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
Monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
^ n o p o l i z g or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part 
the United States. 
Nor may the Board approve a proposed acquisition, 
th 
M l e
 effect of which, in any section of the country, may be substantially 
to 1 
lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any 
°ther manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that 
e
 anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed 
the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting 

* J 3 3 6 
- 6 -
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. 
In each case, 
the Board is required to take into consideration the financial and managerial 
Resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks 
concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. 
Competitive effects of the proposed transaction. - 
The 
frust is, and Applicant would become, the largest of 17 bank holding 
companies in Florida. 
The 30 subsidiary banks are located in 20 counties 
in 
Widely separated areas of the State, and account for 8 per cent of the 
deposits and 6.3 per cent of the banking offices of all banks in Florida. 
Except for two banks (Opa-Loclca Bank and Lake Shore Bank) 
^hich were organized since 1960 under sponsorship of the Trust, all of 
th 
subj 
ect banks have been affiliated with the Trust for more than 10 
y e a r s
> and most have been so affiliated for more than 20 years. 
Because 
these long-standing affiliations, none of the banks in the group competes 
any of the others. Moreover, 14 of the banks are located in communities 
and 
counties separate from any of the others, so that, even in the absence 
of f-u 
i-ne present affiliation, competition among them or with other subsidiaries 
0 f
 the Trust would be unlikely. 
In each of six counties, there are located two or more of the 
Pr
°Posed subsidiary banks. Miami Bank, Coral Gables Bank, and Opa-Loclca Bank 
9 t e
 
located in Dade County. 
Together, they control 7.5 per cent of 
c
°vinty deposits, and constitute the fourth largest banking organization in 
the 
county. Miami Bank has been controlled by the Trust since 1931, and 
^°
r
al Gables Bank and Opa-Locka Bank have been affiliated with the group 
8
*
n
c e their organization in 1944 and 1960, respectively. 

ifgpp 
2337 
- 7 -
Five of the subject banks are located in Duval County -
Jacksonville Bank, Arlington Bank, Dealers and Growers Bank, Lake Shore 
Bank, and Northside Bank - and account, in the aggregate, for about 
27 «« 
Per cent of county deposits. Four other holding companies, one of 
which is larger than the Trust in terms of local deposits, have subsidiary 
hanks in the Jacksonville area. 
Two of the banks are located in each of the counties of 
Escambia, Palm Beach, Polk, and Volusia. 
The subsidiaries in each of 
ti 
G
 three latter counties, however, are located from 16 to 37 miles 
a
Part, and primarily serve distinct sections of the county in which they 
a r e
 located; in each case, there is at least one banking organization 
with a larger share of county deposits. 
The two proposed subsidiary 
hanks in Escambia County - Pensacola Bank and Brent Bank - are both 
S e a t e d in the Pensacola Area. Although the Trust is the largest banking 
°
r
8anization in the County, controlling 24.5 per cent of county deposits, 
does not dominate banking either in the county or the Pensacola area. 
Although Applicant would become the largest banking organization 
Florida, the proposed subsidiary banks do not appear dominant either 
the State as a whole or in any local area, and their affiliation under 
c
°
n
trol of the Trust does not appear to have had anticompetitive effects. 
It i 
l s
 also significant that the 1966 amendments to the Act indicate no 
C
°
n
8ressional intent that the banking group, as such, be broken, as 
e v i
-denced by the fact that the Trust was given the option of retaining all 

its banking subsidiaries and divesting its non-banking interests, 
these reasons, the Board is of the view that competitive considerations 
d o 
n o t
 present a bar to consummation of Applicant's proposal. 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
c
°nsummation of the proposal would not result in a monopoly, or be in 
furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the 
business of banking in any area, and would not restrain trade, 
substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly in any 
S G
ction of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant, a newly-chartered corporation, would begin operations with 
S a t
isfactory financial condition and with assets consisting of its 
investments in the 30 proposed subsidiary banks. The banks are in sound 
financial condition and prospects of the group are favorable. 
Management of Applicant and its subsidiary banks is competent. 
^°cause of the statutory requirement that the Trust divest itself of 
c
°utrol of Applicant, changes in Applicant's management will be required 
p r i
o r to July 1, 1971. Applicant has indicated that, prior to that date, 
Ganges will be effected so that thereafter no trustee, officer, director. 
°
r
 employee of the Trust or its subsidiaries will be either an officer 
director of Applicant. Applicant has demonstrated that there is within 
th k 
e
 banking group sufficient qualified personnel who would have no connection 
^ t h the Trust or its affiliates to provide assurance that divestiture by 
the 
e
 Trust can be accomplished without presenting management succession 
Pr
°blems to Applicant. 
•

- 9 -
To the extent that consummation of the proposal would 
facilitate divestiture by the Trust in compliance with the Congressional 
m
andate, while at the same time avoiding possible difficulties which 
smaller banks among the proposed subsidiaries might face were they to be 
deprived of the banking affiliations upon which they have become dependent, 
considerations under the banking factors weigh in favor of approval 
o f
 the application. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. -
Consummation of Applicant's proposal would likely effect little 
°hange in the convenience or needs of the communities served by the 
P
r
°posed subsidiary banks. The principal benefits to the communities 
involved would result from the fact that the proposal would permit the 
anks to continue to serve in much the same manner as in the past, 
avoiding the disruptions which might result from possible alternative 
Methods of terminating their affiliation with the Trust and its non-
b
a n k i n g subsidiaries. 
These considerations provide additional weight in support 
of approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all of the relevant 
acts contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set 
f®tth 
in section 3(c) of the A c t , it is the Board's judgment that the 
Pr
°Posed transaction would be in the public interest, and that the 
appli 
•••cation should be approved.

Gentl emen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, 
New York, N e w York, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 9 and 
of the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Norfolk 
ouse, Frederick Street, Nassau, Bahamas, and to operate and main-
tain such branch subject to the provisions of such Sections and 
o f
 Regulation M . 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
ranch will be used for developing new international business and 
J|°t as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
nited States. 
It is also understood that there is to be no con-
a c
t with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, 
staff } 
a n c j bookkeeping m a y , at least in part, be supplied under 
contract by another party. 
In view of the special character of 
is operation, the foregoing permission is granted subject to 
continuing observation and review by the Board and after due 
Notice may be withdrawn or modified. 
The foregoing permission is 
so granted on the condition that adequate information covering 
e branch's operations will be maintained at your,head office and 
* 1 be available to the Board and its accredited representatives, 
e Board should be promptly informed of any modification in the 
anch's methods of operation, including changes in any contract 
e r

Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before September 1, 1971, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, when the branch is opened for business. 
"Je Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Nassau. 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits pay-
le only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the States 
0
 
the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt from 
p
n y
 Imitations oil rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 and 
^gulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D (but see Sec-
^ °n 213.7 of Regulation M) . The general purpose of these exemptions 
s to allow foreign branches of United States banks to compete abroad 
n
 foreign banks. 
In these circumstances, It has long been and 
c
°ntinues to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System to dis-
courage deposits by United States residents at foreign branches of 
ited States banks unless such deposits have been placed to serve 
^finite, necessary purpose in connection with foreign or inter-
a t
i o n a l transactions outside the United States. 
£ 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
unds provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated 
Pitalj advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign 
sets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort.

Gent 1 emen: 
As requested in your letter of July 6, 1970, the Board 
°f Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("MHIBC") to pur-
chase and hold approximately 333,334 additional shares of Commercial 
Export Credit Company Ltd. ("CEC"), London, England, at a cost of 
a
Pproximat ely $680,000, provided such shares are acquired within 
one year from the date of this letter. 
In this connection, the pur-
chase and holding of such shares in excess of 10 per cent of your 
Corporation's capital and surplus is also approved. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
shares of CEC by MHIBC is granted subject to the following con-
ditions: 
(1) 
That MHIBC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in CEC if CEC at any time fails 
to restrict its activities to those permissible to 
a corporation in which a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, with 
the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase and 
hold stock, or if CEC establishes any branch or agency 
or takes any action or undertakes any operation in England 
or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the time would 
not be permissible to MHIBC; 
(2) 
That, when required by the Board of Governors, MHIBC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of CEC as it may require from time to 
time; 

2 3 4 3

Banking Corporation 
(3) 
That any share acquisitions or dispositions by CEC 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K 
in the same manner as if CEC were a corporation 
organized under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve 
Act; and 
(4) 
That MHIBC shall not carry on its books the shares of 
CEC at a net amount in excess of its proportionate 
share of the book capital accounts of CEC, after giving 
effect to the elimination of all known losses. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
°f the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as 
they relate to restrictions on loans granted by CEC in England in 
the currency of that country. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Sank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
°f Association, and By-Laws of CEC. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding that 
the investment now being approved will be made within the guidelines 
established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect 
a s
 they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities of 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and its subsidiaries, and that 
due consideration is being given to the priorities contained therein.
