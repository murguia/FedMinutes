Minutes of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System on Wednesday, May 7, 1969. The Board met in the Board 
Room at 9:30 a.m. 
PRESENT: Mr. Martin, Chairman 
Mr. Robertson, Vice Chairman 
Mr. Mitchell 
Mr. Daane 
Mr. Maisel 
Mr. Brimmer 
Mr. Sherrill 
Mr. Johnson, Director, Division of 
Personnel Administration 
Staff salaries. 
In furtherance of the discussion on March 21, 
1969, concerning salaries of the Board's official staff, as recorded 
in the memorandum attached as Item No. 1, Governor Sherrill presented 
a series of recommendations for Board action. First, on the basis of 
further study following the March 21 discussion, he recommended as a 
general action an approximate 10.3 per cent increase to members of the 
official staff. This was intended to provide an adjustment in such 
salaries reasonably commensurate with the intended midyear increase in 
Civil Service salary schedules. 
After discussion, the Board approved this recommendation. 
Mr. Johnson then withdrew from the meeting and Governor 
Sherrill stated that there were additional recommendations for special 
salary increases for certain members of the official staff that he 
wished to present for consideration by the Board. After explaining the 
considerations underlying each of the proposed special salary increments, 
he called particular attention to the increases proposed for the top

three staff members, Messrs. Holland, Brill, and R. Solomon. He 
pointed out that in the present circumstances these three men served 
as the Board's chief policy advisers, and that in addition Mr. Holland 
was serving as the Board's chief of staff. The Board had come to 
employ the officials in these three positions as the equivalent of 
Assistant Secretaries in most of the Executive Departments of the 
Government. They operated on behalf of the Board as equals with 
Assistant Secretaries in interagency negotiations, and had been paid 
at about the same salary level as most Assistant Secretaries prior to 
the increase in Federal executive salaries last winter. An additional 
reason for a substantial increase in the top advisers' salaries was 
to be able to pay them and their subordinates enough to attract and 
hold highly competent staff members in the face of competing employment 
opportunities inside and outside Government. Accordingly, Governor 
Sherrill recommended that the annual salaries of Messrs. Brill and 
Solomon be raised to $38,000—equivalent to Level IV in the Federal 
executive pay schedule, which included most Assistant Secretaries—and 
that Mr. Holland be raised to $39,000 annually in recognition of his 
additional responsibilities as chief of staff. This would place all 
three of these officials appropriately below Federal executive salary 
Level III (which included all Board members except the Chairman), with 
the expectation that no further salary increases for these officials 
would be considered in the absence of future changes in the general 
salary levels of Board members and Federal executives.

After discussion, the Board approved the recommended special 
salary increases. Attached as Item No. 2 is a list showing all of 
the official staff salary revisions as approved by the Board, effective 
May 18, 1969. 
Governor Robertson dissented from the above salary actions 
taken by the Board, and his dissenting statement is appended to these 
minutes as Item No. 3. 
At this meeting the Board also approved the appointment of 
Milton W. Schober as Assistant Director in the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation at an annual salary of $23,500, and of John D. Smith as 
Assistant Director of the Division of Administrative Services at an 
annual salary of $21,000, both appointments being effective on this date.

"Laundry list" for one-bank holding company bill. There had 
been distributed a memorandum from Mr. Cardon dated May 5, 1969, 
reporting a request from the staff of the House Banking and Currency 
Committee for assistance in developing statutory language more specific 
than either the present law or the Administration bill in describing 
activities permissible for bank holding companies. A draft of such 
language was attached to Mr. Cardon's memorandum, should the Board 
wish to supply it, in present or revised form, to the Committee staff. 
This request reflected primarily the interest of Congressman 
Reuss, although several members of the Committee had, during hearings, 
commented on the need for greater specificity. Chairman Martin had 
agreed that that was desirable, although difficult, and had agreed to 
try to help the Committee in its efforts to develop a so-called "laundry 
list." 
Mr. Cardon reported that since preparing his memorandum he had learned 
that, in response to a similar request for assistance, the Office of the 

1531 
5/7/69 
' 
-5-
Comptroller of the Currency had stated that such a list could not be 
devised. However, it was understood that this had been on the mistaken 
assumption that Mr. Reuss would not accept the inclusion of a "basket 
clause." The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had also been 
contacted by the Committee staff, but because of the absence of Chairman 
Randall that agency had not yet responded. However, Mr. Reuss expected 
some report on the matter when Mr. Randall testified before the 
Committee on Friday, May 9. 
Mr. Cardon suggested that a number of alternative courses appeared 
to be open to the Board. First, it might simply state that it viewed the 
development of such a list as impracticable. Second, it could direct 
the staff to submit a list to the Committee staff, keeping the communi-
cation at that level and avoiding a formal Board position. Or it could 
submit a list--that attached to Mr. Cardon's memorandum or another—as 
an official Board position. 
In response to a question, Mr. Cardon stated that, while the 
Board was probably not committed to reply by Friday, it was important 
that any list submitted be available early enough to be compared with 
other recommendations before the Committee went into executive session. 
That argued for a final decision by early next week. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he thought the Board should take 
an official position on the matter as soon as possible. He understood 
that the Committee itself had differences on the matter and was relying 

1531 
5/7/69 
' 
-6-
on recommendations from the banking agencies to provide a focus for its 
deliberations. 
Governor Brimmer also reported that the Administration's position, 
as conveyed to him by Treasury Under Secretary Walker, was one of 
being opposed in principle to the "laundry list." However, if such a 
list proved necessary--and their opposition was apparently not strong— 
they would favor the direction in which the Board seemed to be moving. 
Mr. Holland noted that the Treasury had itself submitted a 
list of permissible activities, but Mr. Cardon pointed out that it had 
not been cast in statutory language and was more comparable to the 
informal list included in Board testimony than to the currently proposed 
list. 
Governor Sherrill suggested that the inclusion of specific pro-
hibitions in the list should be examined carefully. As an example he 
pointed to item (A): an institution "lending funds on its own account 
(but not a savings bank or a savings and loan association) or for the 
account of others." He felt that it would be premature for the Board 
to recommend exclusion of ownership of thrift institutions; in his, 
opinion, some of those institutions might ultimately have to become 
bank-related if they were to survive. Governor Mitchell, on the other 
hand, stressed the importance of competition between the thrift 
institutions and commercial banks. 
(However, Governor Mitchell urged 
that ownership of finance companies, not specified in the current draft, 
be permitted.) Question was raised whether the Congress had not already 

1531 
5/7/69 
' 
-7-
taken some action to limit holding company ownership of savings and 
loan associations; it was believed that that legislation had limited 
such ownership to a single association, but neither the intent nor 
the precise provisions of the legislation could be recalled with cer-
tainty. Mr. Cardon predicted that an explicit authorization, in con-
trast to the explicit prohibition now included, would be rejected by 
the Congress for a variety of reasons, both philosophical and practical. 
It was then suggested, and agreed to by Chairman Martin, that the 
"laundry list" might best remain silent on the question of thrift 
institutions. 
Governor Maisel, who expressed a willingness to have the list 
go forward at either Board or staff level, suggested three language 
changes. In item (F) he would relax the requirement to "acting as 
an insurer primarily in connection with extensions of credit by other 
subsidiaries of the holding company," although he was hesitant to 
recommend a specific cut-off point. Some interest was also expressed 
in the use of the word "principally." 
Governor Maisel's second change was in item (K), where he would 
broaden the last phrase, perhaps to refer to "banking organization and 
facilities." He suggested that better language might be found, but 
urged that "resources" not be used, since the point at issue was not 
money. Finally, he referred to the sentence in the middle of page 2 
beginning "Such regulations . . . " and suggested that use of the word 

1531 
5/7/69 
' 
-8-
"anticompetitive" might in effect limit the Board to applying the 
provisions of the Clayton Act. He felt that such a limitation would 
be undesirable and urged that the language be broadened. 
Possible language to limit the activities that would be per-
mitted under items (E) and (G)--acting as an insurance agent or broker 
and providing accounting or data processing services, respectively— 
had been included (in brackets) in the draft list. Mr. Cardon reported 
that the qualification in (E) reflected a concern that otherwise 
insurance agents might be led to push for a complete exclusion. It 
was generally felt that the bracketed language should be retained, al-
though Governor Sherrill favored a somewhat broader statement. There 
was, however, a question as to whether the income referred to would 
be most accurately described as "premium" or "commission." It was 
agreed, at Mr. Cardon's suggestion, that the point would be checked 
and whichever term had been employed in earlier statements on the matter 
would also be used here. 
No objections were raised regarding retention of the bracketed 
language in item (G). 
Governor Robertson objected to the list as a whole because it 
placed no limit on location. Mr. Holland suggested insertion of location 
as one of the relevant factors serving as a basis for the establishment of 
limitations on permissible activities; however, Governors Mitchell and 
Maisel opposed a limitation on location. While differences of view thus 

X 5 J 4 
5/7/69 
-9-
existed, there was general agreement that a fundamental issue of policy 
was involved and that it should be recognized. Governor Brimmer 
expressed the view that the issue could only be resolved by the Con-
gress and suggested that the present bill might provide an appropriate 
vehicle. 
Returning to the items enumerated in the draft list, Mr. Cardon 
expressed concern that the reference to housing goals in item (J) was 
too broad and suggested insertion of the phrase "for low-income families." 
However, Governor Maisel pointed out that in the past Congress had 
referred to both "low-income" and "moderate-income" in a single phrase 
and suggested that that might also be necessary here. Also with regard 
to item (J), Governor Robertson urged that the reference to "employment 
opportunities" be narrowed. 
After further discussion, Chairman Martin urged that an effort 
be made to resolve the differences of opinion that obviously existed in 
such a way that a response might be made to the Congressional request 
as promptly as possible. On that note it was understood that the draft 
"laundry list" would be considered further at tomorrow's meeting. 
Other agenda items. It was understood that the other items that 
had been listed on the agenda for consideration at today's meeting would 
be rescheduled for discussion on the earliest practicable dates. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Subject? Official 3taff salaries 
fc OCl Office of the. Secretary 
At the conclusion of the meeting on March 21, 1969, the members 
of the Beard (Chairman Martin absent) met in executive session with the 
Director of the Division of Personnel Administration. 
Governor Sherrill raised with the Board the issue of revamping 
the. official staff salary structure and reviewed briefly the developments 
that had produced, the current pattern of official salaries. 
(See memo-
randum dated March 3L, 1969, from Governor Sherrill summarizing such 
information.) He pointed out that voluntarily limiting the Board's offi-
cial salary actions in recent years to the dimensions generally set by 
the structural increases in Civil Service Grades 16, 17, and 1.8 had pro-
duced a staff salary structure that was extremely compacted and that had 
lost ground competitively to other employment. This year's major struc-
tural increase in Executive Pay Schedules, including salaries of Board 
^embers, afforded an opportunity to redress these shortcomings in a manner 
vhich should encourage efficient staff performance. 
Accordingly, Governor Sherrill recommended that the Board undertake 
three kinds of salary actions at this time. The first recommendation was 
for a general increase of 12.5 per cent in official staff salaries. 
This 
Increase, in turn, could be broken down into two parts, A 10.3 per cent 
increase would match the average of midyear structural increases proposed 
for Civil Service Grades GS-16 (9.7 per cent), GS-17 (10.3 per cent), and 
GS-18 (10,8 per cent). This would allow Board staff salaries to share 
fully in the upcoming increase in the Civil Service structure to match 
estimated recent increases in private compensation levels. An additional 
general 2.3 per cent increase in Board salaries was proposed to strengthen 
the competitive position of the staff salary structure and in recognition 
the intended high standards for quality of staff work. 
Second, Governor Sherrill recommended to che Board, as a matter 
°f policy, that additional salary adjustments be made in a number of 
instances in recognition of individual responsibilities and performance, 
He discussed briefly the special considerations attaching to each of the 
Proposed increases in this category. He felt, as a general rule, that 
such increases might best be. combined with the equivalent of the Civil 
Service structural increase and announced around the turn of each year. 
suc.h a year-end review had been made by the Board in earlier years and 
was believed to add more to the staff's sense of achievement than an 
annual automatic increase coincident with a Civil Service structural adjust-
ment. 

Finally, Governor Sherrill recommended that the Eoard fellow up 
the rise in Executive Pay Schedules by making a corresponding increase in 
the salaries of those top staff officials most closely involved in the for-
mulation of Board policy. In particular, the three highest ranking staff 
officials (Messrs. Brill, Holland, and Robert Solomon) had previously been 
paid a salary about equal to Assistant Secretaries in the Executive Depart-
ments (Level IV, one level below that of Board members) and in fact often 
dealt with that level of official in representing the Board in cooperative 
efforts with other Federal agencies. It seemed appropriate, therefore, for 
the salaries of these staff officials to be raised commensurately, 
After discussion, the majority of the Board members indicated their 
general agreement with the principles and recommendations presented by 
Governor Sherrill. The consensus was that moving in the direction cut-
lined would be a proper exercise of Board responsibility in the interest 
of recruiting and retaining a talented staff. The Board withheld a final 
Vote as to whether the proposed general salary increase should be 12.5 per 
cent or .10.3 per cent, pending further discussion and study of the record.

>01. Governor Sherrill. 
The following information is furnished in connection with the Board's 
discussion of official staff salaries in Executive Session on March 21, 1969. 
» 
Background information 
The Board has had a policy of considering the salaries of its official 
staff on an individual basis rather than aligning them precisely with the 
compensation provisions of Civil Service Grades GS 16, 17 and 18. 
Formerly, 
official salaries were revised on an annual review basis, taking into con-
sideration the responsibilities and performance of individual incumbents. 
However, when the GS grade salary levels began to be increased substantially 
in a series of structural adjustments the Board felt it advisable to grant 
increases to its official staff simultaneously, in amounts generally similar 
in percentage to the increases in Grades 16, 17 and 18. 
Those increases largely used up the head room formerly available for annual 
salary adjustments based upon responsibilities and performance. 
As a result, 
there have been very few performance-related year-end adjustments in recent 
years. 
Considerable compaction developed between salaries of the official 
staff members, as well as between the top staff salaries and those of Members 
of the Board. 
July 1968 increases 
At that time Civil Service Grades GS 16, 17, and 18 were adjusted to a 
maximum of $30,239 in Grade 18; however, since the rate of Executive Pay 
Schedule Level V was $28,000, no salary was increased in excess of $28,000, 
with the remainder of the increase being deferred until such time as the 
executive schedule was revised. When revisions in that schedule became ef-
fective recently, the incumbents of Grades 16, 17, and 18 received the remainder 
of the salary increase approved in July 1968. 
The Board approach in July 1968 followed the Civil Service format. 
The 
official staff were given approximately 10 per cent increases with $29,000 as 
a maximum salary (just below the $29,500 salary of Board Members). .Two 
officials, Brill and Holland, who were at $29,000 at that time, received no 
increases. 
When the salary of the Board Members (Executive Pay Level III) was in-
creased to $40,000, the Board made the necessary adjustments in the salaries 
of those officials who had not received the full 10 per cent in July. 
These 
salary adjustments were effective February 24, 1969, resulting in salaries 
ranging up to $32,000 (Brill and Holland) for the official staff. 

1538 
To: Board of Governors

Probable increases in July 1969 
The Administration has released for publication its planned recommenda-
tions for further adjustments in salary structures effective in July 1969. 
The top step of Grade 18 will become $33,495 at that time. As this amount 
is lower than the Executive Pay Level V ($36,000), the full amount of all 
increases will be effective at that time. 
Under the Board's present practice, official staff salaries would again 
be adjusted generally upward in July 1969 in amounts corresponding to the 
structural increases in GS Grades 16, 17 and 18. 
Attached is additional information which might be of interest to the 
Board, including (1) a table of comparison of increases for its official 
staff at the rates of 10.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent; 
(2) a schedule of 
present salary structures, with the possible July 1969 salaries inserted; 
(3) comparisons of pay levels for certain economist type Government official 
Positions the incumbents of which are appointed by the President; and (4) 
a review of instances where salaries of the Board's official staff exceeded 
the salaries of Board Members.

1541 
Item No. 3 
5/7/69 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
Governor Robertson dissented from the Board actions to approve 
the listed salary schedule for the Board's official staff. 
It was his 
position that the salaries being approved were excessive for tha follow-
ing reasons: 
(1) While he is as desirous as any other Board member of ade-
quately compensating staff, he believed that the compensation should not 
drastically exceed the compensatory levels provided for other govern-
ment employees in recent legislation. Outside of the Federal Reserve 
Board, the salary of the top career employee of any department of the 
Government is now less than $31,000; even after the proposed July 1 
increase, it will not exceed $33,500 (Grade 18). The salaries being 
approved for three members of our staff are equal to or in excess of 
the $38,000 level which Congress fixed for Assistant Secretaries of 
Executive Departments - individuals who serve in non-career, policy-
making positions, subject to the whim of politics and without the 
security of tenure surrounding members of our staff. 
It was his view 
that the action of the Board in increasing compensation of its officers 
to such a high level was not only unnecessary and unwise but violated 
the spirit of the recent Congressional legislative action, which set 
a much lower ceiling for government employees. 
In response to the 
argument that the higher salaries were needed in order to give status 
to our staff officers, he stated that he could see no greater reason 
for having three members of the staff at or above the Assistant Secre-
tary salary level than for having the Director of the Division of 

1542 
5/7/69 
-2-
Supervision and Regulation and the General Counsel in that status -
they are just as important to the Board's work. 
(2) In his view the salaries approved represent an action 
which is unfair to the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve (that posi-
tion will be available for Presidential appointment after January 31 of 
next year), for that individual may not have the confidence in our 
economist officers that the present Board members do, and may wish to 
bring in other individuals. However, this would be difficult to do 
because career people will be receiving salaries which leave no room 
for the insertion of a higher salary echelon. 
(3) In a period of inflation such as now, he felt that it was 
bad enough for Congress to increase so greatly the salaries of elective 
and Presidential-appointive officials, but that it was equally bad, and 
perhaps even worse, for the Federal Reserve - which should be in the 
forefront of inflation-fighters - to increase salaries of its career 
officials by extreme amounts in such a period. 
(4) It was his view that good personnel policy calls for the 
retention of sufficient head-room to provide for salary increases in
