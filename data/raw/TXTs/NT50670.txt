Chairman Burns first mentioned various complaints concerning 
Board handling of Reserve Bank officers' salaries that had been con-
veyed to him at luncheon by several Presidents. 
After some discussion 
°f the matter, he asked Governor Maisel, as incoming Chairman of the 
Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, to arrange 
t 0 m e e t with the Presidents or appropriate representatives thereof to 
talk over the points at issue. 
Chairman Burns reported to the Board the progress of various 
d i cessions concerning the pressing credit needs of the Penn Central 
Tic 
sPortation Company, now in the hands of court-appointed trustees. 
iscussion touched upon the apparent inability of the trustees to raise 
s Privately, the implications of a shutdown of the railroad's opera-
t~ i n s> the probable inability of the firm to qualify for a Federal 
Re S G r v e loan, and the possible alternative steps that might be pursued 
by j-u e railroad and the interested arms of Government.

Chairman Burns then raised the subject of changing various 
assignments and delegations of authority to Board members. 
He said 
he felt some changes in assignments were called for, both in view of 
the number of problems calling for close Board attention and the desir-
ability of rotating assignments as feasible to share the burden of work 
and broaden the contacts of the Governors with such problems. He dis-
tributed a memorandum to the Board dated September 15, 1970, outlining 
the changes he thought desirable (copy attached). 
Subject to any 
comments or desires for changes therefrom expressed by any of the 
Governors, he proposed to put such changes into effect. No requests 
changes were expressed at the meeting. 
(Note: Nor were such re-
^estsmade subsequently. 
The changes therefore were put into effect.) 
At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Holland then outlined the 
course of various discussions with the Federal Advisory Council, offi-
cials of the American Bankers Association, and Chairman Martin of the 
u m e Loan Bank Board concerning the latter's regulation, effective 
September 14, 1970, permitting member savings and loan associations 
t° make authorized transfers to third parties from shareholder accounts. 
Cha" 
irman Burns planned a meeting on the subject with Chairman Martin of 
the Home Loan Bank Board on September 16. Some sympathy was expressed 
giving member commercial banks similar authority, but it was recog-
ized that this combination of actions could well produce major changes

the financial system over the long run that had not been fully 
explored. While such changes might on balance prove desirable, Board 
members requested a more thorough staff analysis of the various steps 
in question and their implications. 
The meeting then adjourned.
