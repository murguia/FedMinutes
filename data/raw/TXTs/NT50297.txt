Sterling balances credit package. There was distributed a 
further revised draft of a "Proposal for U.S. Participation in Sterling 
Balances Credit Package." 
This draft, dated July 2, 1968, read as 
follows: 
It is proposed that the Treasury, through the ESF, 
Participate as principal in the arrangement with the BIS; 
that is, the Treasury would undertake a commitment to make 
three-month renewable dollar/sterling swaps with the BIS 
for the U.S. share (approximately $600 million). As out-
lined in the BIS plan, such swaps could be drawn upon by 
the BIS - to finance drawdowns of sterling balances - dur-
l n
8 a three-year period and, after a two-year grace period, 
would be repayable during a five-year period ending ten 
years after the initiation of the scheme. 
When and to the extent that the swap was drawn upon 
b
y the BIS, the dollars would be made available by the ESF. 
If the resources of the ESF are insufficient to meet these 
and other commitments, the Federal Reserve would be prepared 
to warehouse temporarily for the ESF necessary portions of 
the sterling it acquires as a result of the swap with the 
BIS.

In view of the principle that the Federal Reserve 
should confine its foreign operations to short-term maturi-
ties, the Treasury will provide assurance to the Federal 
Reserve of its readiness, upon request, to take back the 
warehoused sterling within a reasonably short period. In 
any event, the Treasury will stand ready, upon three months' 
Prior notice, to reacquire each warehoused drawing at any 
time beginning one year from the date of warehousing. Any 
rewarehousing of sterling involved in a particular drawing 
will be at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. 
Chairman Martin stated that he and Governor Robertson had 
m e
t yesterday with the Secretary of the Treasury and late in the 
afternoon with the President, who had given his approval to moving 
forward with U.S. participation in a sterling balances credit package 
that would include an arrangement of the kind stated in the proposal 
distributed at this meeting. 
Governor Robertson reviewed the changes that had been made, 
c a ^ • 
l n
8 attention particularly to the addition of the last sentence, 
W h
ich
 s p e c i f i e d
 that any rewarehousing of sterling involved in a 
Particular drawing would be at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. 
H e
 said the Treasury had agreed to the addition of that sentence. 
Mr. Holland said he had contacted the Reserve Bank Presidents 
h
°
 W e r e 
v
°ting members of the Federal Open Market Committee and 
d i 
c
ussed the proposal with them. They were all agreeable to nego-
t l a
ting on the basis set forth in the proposal. 
Governor Robertson said there had been an understanding that 
the U s 
'
 W o u l
d not participate in the sterling balances credit package 
0
 a greater extent than $700 million. That would be the U.S. share 

7/2/68 
-3-
if the French did not participate; if they did participate, the U.S. 
share would be about $620 million. In negotiating at the forthcoming 
Basle meeting, he would have no authority to go beyond those amounts. 
It was noted that if the negotiations at Basle proceeded along 
the lines anticipated, the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting 
July 16, 1968, would be called upon to approve an increase in the 
authorization for acquisition of warehoused sterling equivalent to the 
U s 
h 
• snare in the proposed sterling balances credit package. 
Members of the Board then indicated that they found the 
memorandum of understanding between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve 
a c c
eptabl e in the form of the draft dated July 2, 1968.

R 
o r

S u
pplied by the applicant and analyzed by Mr. Sammons of the Division 
o f
 International Finance in a memorandum of June 26, 1968. 
Governor Brimmer then made reference to a prospective visit 
today by 
representatives of the Belgian-American Banking Corporation, 
New York, New York, who sought an exception to the guidelines of the 
foreign credit restraint program to enable the extending of nonexport 
credits to continental Western Europe on the basis of a program the 
nature of which he described. Governor Brimmer said he planned to 
e a c t n e
8
a
tively, thus maintaining a position taken previously, and 
t
hat he simply wanted the Board to be aware of the matter.

ments , as issued, are attached under Item No. 5, along with a copy

the issuance of an order exempting Piedmont Trust Bank, Martinsville, 
Virginia, from the registration requirements of section 12(g) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and thereby also from the registra-
tion requirements of Regulation F, Securities of Member State Banks)

a
 revision of grades 1 through 11 of the salary structures applicable 
to employees of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and its branches, 
W l
th the understanding that the Bank's proposal for a single structure 
f o 
0 r
 the District in grades 12 through 16 was not approved and that the 
Division of Personnel Administration would work with the Bank toward 
formulating revised structures for those grades. A copy of the letter 
S e
nt to the Reserve Bank is attached as Item No. 7.

a
 recommendation that the Committee on Personnel undertake a survey 
of programs at the Reserve Banks relating to the hiring of disadvan-
taged persons. 
A memorandum dated July 1, 1968, from the Office of the 
Secretary and the Division of Personnel Administration noted that 
the subject was a matter of Systemwide interest as to which the Board 
had expressed concern and that a survey such as contemplated should 
develop information that could be used in carrying forward various 
a s
Pects of the total equal employment opportunity program. 
As recommended in the memorandum, unanimous approval was 
given to a letter to the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks in 
t h
e form attached as Item No. 8. 
Call report. Under the procedure prescribed by statute the 
c 1 o 
s e
 of business June 29, 1968, had been selected as the date for the 
c
ond call for reports of condition to be made by insured banks within 
t he 
e
 calendar year 1968. The call was to be announced on July 3. 
In accordance with the usual procedure, a telegram had been 
e n t
 to all Federal Reserve Banks on July 1 advising that a call for 
r e
Port s
 of condition by State member banks as of the close of business 
J u n e
 
should be made at a specified time on forms previously 
f
Wnished by the Board. 
The sending of the telegram was ratified by unanimous vote.

Discount study. Upon recommendation by Mr. Holland, the 
B
°ard approved a budget overexpenditure to the extent necessary to 
effect a more widespread distribution than originally contemplated 
°f the Final Report of the Steering Committee for the Fundamental 
Reappraisal of the Discount Mechanism and of the research results 
°f the discount study. This reflected a suggestion by discount 
officers of the Federal Reserve Banks that copies of the Steering 
Committee report be sent to all member banks, together with greater 
interest than anticipated on the part of others in that document and 
t he research material. The printing of the Committee report was to 
b e
 done by contract, while the printing of the other material was to 
b e
 done on the Board's premises. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Oral presentation, - On July 29, 1967, there was published in 
the Federal Register (32 Federal Register 1109G) a notice of receipt of 
the application by the Board. The notice provided that within 30 days 
Publication comments and views on the proposed acquisition could be 
filed with the Board. Opposition to the proposal was filed on behalf 
°f The Brown Deer Bank, Silver Spring Bank (a subsidiary of Marshall & 
Hsley Bank Stock Corporation, a registered bank holding company), and 
Hampton State Bank ("Protestants"), all located in Milwaukee, Uisconsin. 
The Brown Deer Bank requested a public hearing. 
In view of the fact that the Comptroller of the Currency did 
n
°t recommend disapproval of the application, no hearing was required 
the Bank Holding Company Act. However, the Board found it appropriate 
i n t h e
 public interest to afford Protestants an opportunity to appear 
b e
£ore the Board to fully state and support their opposing views, and 
f o r
 Applicant to respond thereto. Accordingly, the Board, acting in its 
dl
-scretion, ordered that an oral presentation of views be conducted be-
f o r e
 the Board. Notice of the oral presentation was published in the 
Federal Register (32 Federal Register 18126), and, in accordance therewith,

oral presentation was held at the Board

wonopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
Part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed acquisi-
tion the effect of which, in any section of the country, may be substan-
tially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which 
in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Board 
finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are 
c
learly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the 
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be 
°erved. in each case the Board is required to take into consideration 
financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank 
folding company and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs 
o f
 the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - The 10 largest

organizations in this area, all of which are Milwaukee-based bank holding 
companies, control about 65 per cent of the total deposits in the SMSA 
a

o
f
 A p p l i c a n t control 34 per cent of the deposits in the SMSA and 38 per 
cent of the deposits in Milwaukee County. 
Since the instant proposal involves the acquisition of a pro-
Posed new bank x^hich will be opened only in the event of approval of the 
application, no existing or potential competition between Bank and 
applicant's present subsidiaries would be eliminated by the proposal and 
n
° immediate increase in banking concentration in any area would result. 
Nevertheless, in view of the significant degree of concentration reflected 
b y t h e 
f
oregoing data, and the extent of Applicant's participation in such 
a
rge organization control of banking resources, it cannot be said that a 
Proposal by Applicant to establish a new subsidiary in the area of its 
Neatest domination (Milwaukee County) presents no competitive issues. 
Q
smuch as entry into a commercial banking market is restricted, oppor-
Un
ities for deconcentration are limited. This is particularly true in 
a Cf 
e such as Wisconsin, where branching is highly restricted. If every 
X7
ly developing need for banking facilities which arises in a concentrated 
m a
rket 
were to be filled by the market's dominant organization, any mean-
deconcentration of the market's banking resources would be made 
P°ssiblGj and further concentration might be encouraged. Each appli-
cat i 
-ion by such an organization to expand within its present trade area, 
eve trough acquisition of a new bank, must therefore be examined to 

-3-
determine its probable effect on existing concentration, whether it will 
foreclose an opportunity for new entry which could provide additional 
competition and possibly promote a decrease in concentration, and its 
effect in limiting the development of existing competitors located in 
°r near the area to be served by the new institution. 
In the performance of the afore-described analytical process, 
fc
he Board has been aware that an overly restrictive approach to such 
Proposed expansion would serve only to limit such an organization's ability 
t o
 Provide a more convenient competitive alternative to institutions more 
P
r
oximately located to the area which the neu bank proposes to serve. In 
t t l e
 absence of an evidentiary basis for concluding that existing institu-
tions require this protection, such an approach would impede, rather than 
Promote, the public interest in a competitive banking market. To deny 
ev
°ry proposed expansion by an organization of Applicant's size is poten-
t i a
H y as inimical to competition as would be a practice of approving 
ev<e
*y such proposal. Recognizing that such expansion may have significant 
ant
icompetitive effects in a particular case, but need not have such effects 
^ every case, inquiry must be made as to whether the record facts demon-
s t r
ate such effects to be so probable in the particular case as to require 
Q t
Hal unless clearly outweighed by other considerations. 
Without minimizing the extent of existing concentration in 
Hi] 
au
ke<e County, in analyzing the probable effect of the proposal on the 
^ k e t structure it is significant that there is presently a pronounced 
toward deconcentration in the area. Between the end of 1960 and 

June 30, 1967, the share of Milwaukee County deposits held by the three 
iargest bank holding companies has declined from 76.5 per cent to 72.1 
cent. Applicant's market share has declined by 3.3 per cent over 
fc
he same period, and by about 22 per cent since 1945. Assuming the 
accuracy of the projection that Bank will have about $3.9 million in 
deposits after three years of operation, Applicant's market share would 
increase by .16 per cent if all of such deposits represented new growth. 
Actually, however, since the projection is based upon the anticipation 
t
hat there will be a transfer to Bank of deposits now held by Applicant's 
subsidiary, First Wisconsin National Bank, it is unlikely that the increase 
iu Appii c a n t» s p r e s G n t market share will be that great. In any event, 
Sir* 
G
 Applicant's market share has been declining at an annual rate of 
about ^ 
* P
e
* cent since 1961, the predictable effect of the proposal would 
be 
, 
reduce slightly and temporarily the rate of deconcentration, rather 
han to increase concentration. Under these circumstances, the Board con-
g e s that the proposed transaction would not result in a monopoly nor 
in furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize 
the h usiness of banking in any relevant area.

The projected primary service area 
of the new bank comprises 
a
PProiH imately nine square miles in the northwestern part of the city of 
Mil 
»w«uKee, The area is still in the early stages of industrial, commercial,

Several banking offices are located near the area, including three offices 
of Appii c a nt-1 s largest subsidiary bank, some five to seven miles to the 
s
°uth and southeast of Bank
f
s site. Each of the Protestant banks is located 
about three miles from the site. 
Protestants claim that there is not yet sufficient banking business 
b c i n
S generated within Bank's proposed service area to justify the establish-
m e n
t of a new bank at this time. They assert that approval of Applicant's 
Proposal now would preclude at a later, more needful time, the establishment

 banking institution, unaffiliated with present competitors, which

The record, however, amply supports Applicant's contention that the

possibility is accorded but slight weight in analyzing the public 
interest f 
tactor with respect to the proposal, particularly where, as here, 
theye j 
l s
 no indication that Applicant's proposal is itself inimical to the 
s
ervation of sound banking competition. 

iOV) / A-/ 
-8-
As to the effect of the proposal on existing competitors, it 
appears that all of the banks located near the area to be served by Bank, 
including the Protestants, have shown reasonably good growth. Each appears 
to have the ability to respond to any increase in competition which might 
result from consummation of Applicants proposal. The expectation of 
such increased competition for local accounts tends to support approval 
the proposal, rather than weigh against it. 
On the basis of the record before it, the Board concludes that 
consummation of Applicants proposal would not substantially lessen com-
petition, tend to create a monopoly, or restrain trade in any section of 
the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant's financial condition, and that of its subsidiary banks, is 
regarded as satisfactory. Its prospects are also regarded as favorable, 
a s a
re those of its subsidiary banks. The management of Applicant and its 
Su
bsidiary banks is considered capable and experienced and in all respects 
S a
tls£actory. 
Bank has no financial or operating history. Based upon its 
P

°jected growth and earnings, which projections appear reasonable, and 
the f a c t t ^ a t i t s m a n a g C m e n t u i n be derived from Applicant's present

 also regarded as consistent with approval of the application. 
Convenience and needs of the community involved. - The conven-

Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained i n the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
In administrative bodies, no less than in the courts, it is 
the "good" cases that are largely responsible for bad decisions. If 
the Applicant here were an out-and-out predatory aggressor, using every 
m e a
n s available to gain a strangle hold over a given market, no member 
this Board would have experienced any difficulty with the case. But 
e
*actly the opposite is true here; although the Applicant is the largest 
hanking institution in a highly concentrated banking market, its degree 
domination has been decreasing - not increasing. 
The exemplary performance of this Applicant over the years 
makes it exceedingly difficult to withhold the privilege of establishing 
a
 new bank in an outlying area for the purpose of better serving its 
C u
stomers. But if a supervisory agency is to make its fullest contri-
bution to the public welfare by providing the very best administration 
legislative measures, such as the Bank Holding Company Act and the 
B a
nk Merger Act, it must, to the fullest extent possible, make its 
P°sitions clear and applicable to all alike. Evenhanded justice pre-
cludes twisting positions on the basis of the character of the Applicant 
°lther in a lenient direction for a "good" Applicant or in the opposite 
S e c t i o n for another. 
Three bank holding companies headquartered in Milwaukee control 
cent of total deposits in the Milwaukee Standard Metropolitan 
^
t a
tistical Area, and 72 per cent of the total deposits in Milwaukee 
c
°unty, ihe Applicant, First Wisconsin Bankshares, the largest banking 
Or
8anization in Milwaukee and in the State of Wisconsin, controls about 

2575 
-2-
per cent of the total deposits in the SMSA and about 38 per cent of 
the total deposits in Milwaukee County. It is this bank holding company 
which seeks to expand its operations by establishing a new bank, The 
p
i r s t N o r t h w e s t e r n National Bank of Milwaukee, in a location where its 
e c
onomic feasibility, during the first two years at least, is dependent

transfer of accounts held at offices of its other subsidiaries. 
**
ut
 another way, the new bank is to be established at a place where the 
n e
ed and profitability are insufficient now to justify others in attempting 
t o
 compete for the privilege. 
The majority acknowledges that it would be undesirable to per-
m
it a dominant banking organization in an already highly concentrated 
market to gobble up every site for which an actual or potential need for 
inking services may exist, since to do so would tend to promote increased 
concentration and to foreclose a possible avenue of deconcentration. 
Nevertheless, the Board has approved First Uisconsin's application on 
stated premise that "the record . . . amply supports Applicant's 
Cot
*tention that the present population (11,000) and projected commercial 
d e
v c l 0 p m e r i t 0 f t h e a r e a i s adequate to support profitable operations of 
Bank" 
» and upon the absence of any evidence of record reflecting that a 
c
ompetitively preferable proposal for serving the community's banking 
n e
eds would be forthcoming in the event of denial of the present appli-
C a
tion. 
In my view, the Board's attention should focus, not on the 
N a t i o n of x^hether the area x^ill support profitable operations of this 

••J/"* 
tb 
-3-
particular bank, but on whether, in the alternative, the area would 
support profitable operations of a bank unaffiliated with this holding 
company, in an early decision under the Act, the Board, in denying an 
application of a large bank holding company to acquire a proposed new 
bank, observed that: 
"Bank holding companies often have the available 
resources, and therefore the ability, to act more 
quickly than a group of individuals in endeavoring 
to establish a new bank in an area xjhich gives 
promise of supporting a successful banking operation. 
Such early establishment of a bank, and the acquisi-
tion of its stock by a bank holding company, may 
benefit the community in some respects. On the other 
hand, such an entry into an area by a bank holding 
company bank may, in some circumstances, 'expand the 
size or extent' of the bank holding company system 
in such a manner or to such a degree as to have a 
strong tendency to preclude later entry by a bank 
which is not controlled by a bank holding company. 
It is apparent that in such a situation control of 
a bank by a bank holding company would run counter 
to [competitive] considerations . . . and should not 
be approved unless there are considerations favorable 
to the application that are sufficient to offset such 
adverse circumstances. "1/ 
In the present case, it is anticipated that the new bank will 
become profitable in its third year of operation, at the end of which it 
V 7 i
H have deposits of $3.9 million. However, a large portion of its 
deposits are expected to be derived from the transfer of accounts of 
area residents presently held by Applicant's other subsidiaries. Deposits 
area residents at offices of Applicant's subsidiaries now total approx-
imately $3 million, and it is reasonably anticipated by Applicant that

its ownership of a bank more conveniently located with respect to such 
customers should result in a transfer of many such accounts. 
Applicant's posture is that of offering a more accessible 
location to present customers, whereas an unaffiliated institution must 
b e
gin with no established customer loyalties. The foregoing circumstances 
clearly evidence Applicant's competitive advantage, the nature of which, 
i n m y
 judgment, strongly parallels a competitive position criticized 
m o
*e than twenty years ago by Judge learned Hand in the case of United 
Spates v # Alcoa. 143 F. 2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945)* Referring to Aloca's 
Monopolization of the aluminum ingot market, Judge Hand observed: 
"[Alcoa] insists that it never excluded compet-
itors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion 
than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as 
it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity 
already geared into a great organization, having the 
advantage of experience, trade connections, and the 
elite of personnel." Jtf. at 431. 
The Board's approval of this application enables the Applicant 
to 
establish a new office in an area far in advance of the time when any-
a o
 else could be expected to compete for the privilege. In such case, 
it:
 is hardly surprising that there is no evidence of a competitively 
Preferable proposal. 
In my opinion, a bank holding company which already controls 
a
 nuge proportion of the bank deposits in its area of operation 
should not be permitted to expand by acquiring a new bank within that 
a
 in advance of the time at which a bank at the same proposed location 
could k 
°e profitably established by others not enjoying the benefit of the 
hiding company's market position. 

-3-
Approval of the instant application enables the Applicant 
to exploit its considerable market pouer to foreclose opportunity for 
other prospective market entrants. Carried to its logical conclusions, 
such approval could lead to similar and successive steps to pre-empt 
aev banking sites before others can afford to compete therefor, resulting 
in. even greater concentration of banking pouer in Milwaukee than nou

(1) the bank has assets of $31«9 million and equity capital 
o f
 $2.9 million; 
(2) the bank has outstanding 219,615 shares of capital stock, 
owned by 539 shareholders as of December 31, 1967; 
(3) there is some trading activity and a regular market in 
the bank's stock, with considerable, although primarily local, interest 
such stock; and 
(4) compliance, at this time, with the registration and 
reporting requirements of the Act would impose a severe burden on 
the bank and its personnel.

Dear Sir: 
At the June 17, 1968 Conference of Presidents approval was 
given to the recommendation of the Committee on Personnel that a 
survey be undertaken of programs at the Reserve Banks relating to 
the hiring of disadvantaged persons. As a part of the System's over-
all equal employment opportunity program, the Board is deeply concerned 
w
ith the development of plans to widen the employment opportunities of 
Persons who may be disadvantaged. For this reason the Board is pleased 
to know of the survey that is planned. 
In order that the results of the survey may be as beneficial 
a s
 possible, the Board would favor having its scope broad enough to 
include such areas as recruitment, training anu development programs 
at various levels, and relations with appropriate community and 
educational organizations. It is also suggested that the Committee 
making the survey develop a positive plan of action to promote all 
Phases of equal employment opportunity for consideration by the Board 
a
nd the Reserve Banks. The Board has designated Mr. Edwin J. Johnson, 
Director of the Division of Personnel Administration, and Mr. Robert C. 
Holland, Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, to work with the Confer-
e
nce Committee on the survey. 
The reports filed recently by the Reserve Banks with 
reference to equal employment opportunity (Report EEO-1) are being 
reviewed at this time. Within a few days a summary tabulation • 
reflecting the current pattern of minority group employment will be 
sent to you. 
Very truly yours, 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.
