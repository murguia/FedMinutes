Consent calendar. 
The Board approved unanimously an applica-
tion by Virginia Commonwealth Bankshares, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, 
to acquire the shares of The Bank of Virginia of Roanoke Valley,

Foreign banking matters. 
The Board approved unanimously a let-
ter to Crocker-Citizens National Bank, San Francisco, California, grant-
ing its request for permission to carry on its books shares of Banco 
de Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador, longer than the 12-month period 
specified in Regulation M for the carrying of shares of a foreign bank 
acquired to prevent loss on a debt previously contracted. A copy of 
the letter is attached as Item No. 5. 
Information requested by a Board member previously having now 
been supplied by the staff, the Board approved unanimously a letter to 
First National City Overseas Investment Corporation, New York, New York, 
granting its application for permission to establish two Delaware 
subsidiaries to hold stock in a Belgian finance company, such arrange-
ment being necessary to enable applicant to vote all of its shares in 
the 
finance company. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 6. 
Report on competitive factors. The Board approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency a report on the 
competitive factors involved in a proposed consolidation of The Connecti-
cut National Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and The First New Haven 
National Bank, New Haven, Connecticut. 
The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed consolidation of The 
Connecticut National Bank, Bridgeport, and The First New 
Haven National Bank, New Haven, would eliminate a signifi-
cant amount of existing competition, particularly in the 
local Bridgeport and New Haven banking markets. 
Moreover, 

63G

there is potential for greater competition between the two 
banks through de novo branching or through merger with other 
possible alternatives in which the anticompetitive effects 
would be considerably lessened.

The subject proposal would join the fifth and seventh 
largest banks in the State, creating a bank which would rank 
third, holding about 12 per cent of the State's total commer-
cial bank deposits. Thereafter, the four largest commercial 
banks would hold 58 per cent of total deposits in Connecticut. 
Such a move would continue concentration of banking resources 
in Connecticut in the large banks. 
Overall, the competitive effect of the proposed consoli-
dation would be substantially adverse. 
Holding company application. 
The Board approved unanimously 
an application by First Massachusetts Financial Corporation, Westwood, 
Massachusetts, to become a bank holding company by acquiring shares 
of Massachusetts Bank and Trust Company, Brockton, Massachusetts, and 
authorized the issuance of an order reflecting that decision. A copy 
of the order is attached as Item No. 7. 
Farm Credit Act of 1971. The Board considered a draft of let-
ter proposed to be sent to the Office of Management and Budget in 
response to its request for the Board's views on a draft bill prepared 
by the Farm Credit Administration and known as the Farm Credit Act of 
1971, which would modernize and expand the lending authority of the 
Farm Credit System and would effect many changes in its internal pro-
cedures . 
Members of the Board suggested a number of points for considera-
tion by the staff in preparing a revised draft of letter for review by 
the Board at a time when the Chairman could be present.

Banking problem. 
The Board's attention was called to advice 
from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that two banks in the State 
of Michigan, one a member bank in East Tawas and the other a nonmem-
ber bank in Hale, were encountering difficulty as the result of a 
check-kiting operation. 
It appeared possible that some kind of merger 
or holding company arrangement would have to be worked out promptly, 
perhaps over the forthcoming weekend, to permit the continuation of 
banking operations at the Hale location. 
After discussion, Governor Robertson was authorized to act on 
behalf of the Board over the weekend if the matter should develop in 
such fashion that action on the part of the Board was required. 
(Note: Such action did not prove to be necessary.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), the application of Virginia Commonwealth Bank-
• *.'. x s < ; 
. 
shares, Inc., Richmond, Virginia ("Applicant"), a registered bank 
folding company, for the Board's prior approval of the acquisition 
100 per cent of the voting shares of The Bank of Virginia of 
Roanoke Valley, Vinton, Virginia, a proposed new bank. 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
Written notice of receipt of the application to the Commissioner 

639 
-2-
of Banking for the State of Virginia and requested his views and 
recommendation. The Commissioner recommended approval of the 
application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on January 14, 1971 (36 Federal Register 575), 
Providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
was forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
consideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and 
all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
aftd managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant 
and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the 
communities to be served. Upon such consideration, the Board 
finds that: 
Applicant is the fourth largest banking organization 
and the second largest bank holding company in Virginia, controlling 
banks with aggregate deposits of $582.1 million. This represents 
i. 
8.0 per cent of total banking deposits in the State of Virginia. 
(Banking data are as of June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect holding 

640 
- 3 " 
company acquisitions and formations approved by the Board through 
February 28, 1971.) Since Bank is a proposed new bank, consummation 
of the proposal would not increase concentration in any market. 
Bank would have a single office in the town of Vinton and 
would primarily serve that town, the eastern side of the city of 
Roanoke, and eastern Roanoke County. The three largest banks in 
the city of Roanoke each have branches in Vinton, with which Bank 
would be in competition. The relevant banking market is considered 
c° approximate the cities of Roanoke and Salem and all of Roanoke 
County. Applicant has two bank subsidiaries with offices in that 
market. One such subsidiary, The Bank of Virginia, headquartered 
in Richmond, has a branch office in downtown Roanoke. The other, 
The Bank of Virginia of the Southwest, has four offices in Salem and 
its environs. These two subsidiaries of Applicant together hold 
approximately 11.5 per cent of deposits in the relevant market. Under 
Virginia 
law, no present banking subsidiary of Applicant may establish 
a branch in Bank's primary service area. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
consummation of the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse 
effect on competition in any relevant area and might have a pro-
competitive effect through the introduction of an additional banking 
al-ternative for residents of eastern Roanoke County, presently the 
fastest growing area in the relevant market. The banking factors, 

-2-
10 
as they relate to Applicant, its subsidiaries, and Bank, and consider-
ations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities to 
be served, are regarded as consistent with approval of the application. 
It is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in 
the public interest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered, For the reasons set forth in the 
findings summarized above, that said application be and hereby is 
approved, provided that the action so approved shall not be consum-
mated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of 
this Order, or (b) later than three months after the date of this Order; 
and provided further that (c) The Bank of Virginia of Roanoke Valley 
shall be opened for business not later than six months after the date 
°f this Order. The time periods described in (b) and (c) above may 
ke extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank 
Richmond pursuant to delegated authority. 
By.order of the Board of Governors, March 15, 1971.

Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill.

WASHINGTON, D. C. 
l n the Matter of the Application of 
THE FARMERS SAVINGS AND TRUST COMPANY, 
Mansfield, Ohio, 
approval of merger with the Lucas 
ate Bank, Lucas, Ohio. 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
t h e Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), an application by The Farmers 
Saving3 and Trust Company, Mansfield, Ohio ("Applicant"), a member State 
bank of the Federal Reserve System, for the Board's prior approval of 
the merger of that bank and the Lucas State Bank, Lucas, Ohio ("Bank"), 
Under the charter and the name of Applicant. As an incident to the 
^ g e r , the sole office of Bank would become a branch of Applicant. 
**otice of the proposed merger, in the form approved by the Board, has 
published as required by said Act. 
Pursuant to the Act, the Board requested reports on the 
competitive factors involved from the Attorney General, the Comptroller 
0 f the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The 
has considered all relevant material contained in the record in

tlle light of the factors set forth in the Act, including the effect 
the proposal on competition, the financial and managerial resources 
and prospects of the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of 
the communities to be served, and finds that: 
Applicant (deposits $44 million), the third largest of 
Seven banks located in Richmond County, holds about 17 per cent of 
Richmond County commercial banking deposits. (All banking data are 
as °f June 30, 1970.) Bank (deposits $3 million) is the smallest of 
t h e seven institutions located in Richmond County. Applicant is a 
8ubsidiary of First Banc Group of Ohio, Inc., Columbus, Ohio, which is 
n e fourth largest registered bank holding company in the State, con-
tr°Hing about 3 per cent of deposits in the State of Ohio. Consumma-
te 
0 n of the proposed merger would not increase substantially the 
°ncentration of banking resources in any relevant area. 
Applicant was instrumental in organizing Bank in 1928 and 
pr°vided Bank with its initial management. Since that time Appli-
cant-
and Bank have been closely associated, and each president of 
has been either a president or senior officer of Applicant. 
Th 
e r e is no indication that this close relationship which exists 
etween Applicant and Bank is likely to change in the foreseeable 
fut 
U r e regardless of the Board's action with rcspect to the present 
Plication. In view of the close relationship which has existed

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK

There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to

SV' ^ 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
n°ttc e of receipt of the application to the Ohio Superintendent of Banks 
r guested his views and recommendation. The Superintendent recom-
ed Qpproval of the application. 

16 
- 2 -
Nottce of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on January 26, 1971 (36 Federal Register 1232), pro-
viding an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
Views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application was 
forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its con-
sideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and all 
those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
ai*d the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Upon 
8uch consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant, the second largest bank holding company and the 
fourth largest banking organization in Ohio, controls 10 banks with 
a8gregate deposits of $1,038 million, representing 5.2 per cent of 
tl*e commercial bank deposits in the State. (All banking data are as 
°f June 30, 1970, and reflect holding company acquisitions approved 
by 
the Board to date.) Upon acquisition of Bank ($32 million deposits), 
Applicant would control 5.3 per cent of the corrmercial bank deposits 
in the State; its position relative to other banking organizations 
holding companies would remain the same. 
Bank is by a substantial margin the smallest of four banks 
headquartered in Youngstown and the sixth largest of 14 banks in the 
Youngs town-Warren SMSA, holding less than 4.1 per cent of total area 

deposits. The fifth largest bank in this market has control over aimost 
three times as many deposits as Bank. Applicant's closest subsidiary 
bank is located 33 miles from Youngs town and there is no meaningful 
competition between Bank and that bank or any other of Applicant's sub-
sidiaries . Further, in light of the distances involved and Ohio law 
restricting branching, it seems unlikely on the facts of record that any 
significant competition would develop in the future. Based on the fore-
going, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposal would have 
no adverse effect on competition in any relevant area and might stimulate 
competition in the Youngs town area. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
communities to be served lend some weight toward approval of the appli-
cation as affiliation with Applicant would facilitate loan participations 
at*d would enable Bank to provide international banking services. The 
banking factors are regarded as consistent with approval. It is the 
board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
^terest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered, For the reasons set forth in the findings 
8vimmarized above, that said application be and hereby is approved, pro-
dded that the action so approved shall not be consummated (a) before 
the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order, or 
(b) later than three months after the date of this Order, unless such

In the Matter of the Application of 
UNION BANK, 
Los Angeles, California, 
for approval of merger with Bank 
°f Long Beach, N.A., Long Beach, 
California. 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), an application by Union Bank, 
Los Angeles, California, a member State bank of the Federal Reserve 
System, for the Board's prior approval of the merger of that bank and 
Sank of Long Beach9 N.A., Long Beach, California, under the charter 
a n d name of Union Bank, As an incident to the merger, the two existing 
offices and an approved office (not yet in operation) of Bank of Long 
®each, N.A. would become branches of the resulting bank. Notice of 
'he proposed merger, in form approved by the Board, has been published 
a s required by said Act. 
In accordance with the Act, the Board requested reports on 
competitive factors involved from the Attorney General, the 
Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
ORDER APPROVING APPLICATION 
FOR MERGER OP BANKS UNDER 
BANK MERGER ACT 

051 
- 2 -
The Board has considered all relevant material contained in the record 
in the light of the factors set forth in the Act, including the effect 
of the proposal on competition, the financial and managerial resources 
and prospects of the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of 
the communities to be served, and finds that: 
Union Bank (deposits of $1,5 billion) is the seventh largest 
hank in California, having about 3.3 per cert of the commercial bank 
deposits in the State, (All banking data are as of June 30, 1970.) 
It operates its main office and 16 branches in southern California; 
in northern California it maintains ten offices and has recently 
(February 11, 1971) received approval to operate another office as 
an incident to a merger. Bank of Long Beach, N,A. (deposits of $16 
million) operates two offices in Long Beach, California, and has 
received approval to operate an office in the downtown district of 
that city. 
Bank of Long Beach, N,A,, with about 2,5 per cent of 
market deposits, ranks eighth among the 12 banks (total of 50 offices) 
°Perating in its market area, which includes the cities of Long Beach, 
Lakewood, and Signal Hill, Among the competitors of Bank of Long 
Beach, N,A. are five of the largest banks in the State; these five 
banks operate 64 per cent of the offices located in the area and 
c°ntrol about 69 per cent of the deposits in the area. 

652 
-2-
The office of Union Bank located closest to the nearest 
office of Bank of Long Beach, N.A. is in Torrance, which is about 
12 miles west of Long Beach. A large number of offices of other 
banks are located in the densely populated areas intervening between 
the present offices of Union Bank and Bank of Long Beach, N.A, There 
is, therefore, no substantial existing competition between these two 
banks. 
Under California law each bank could be permitted to 
establish de novo branch offices in the areas served by the other. 
Because of the small size of Bank of Long Beach, N.A., it appears 
unlikely that bank would in the near future establish a d£ novo 
branch outside its market. It also does not appear probable that 
Union Bank would establish a de novo branch office in the Long Beach 
area. In 1966, Union Bank withdrew an application to establish such 
a branch because a large scale real estate development did not pro-
gress beyond the planning stages; since that time, Union Bank indicates 
tllat the area is not sufficiently attractive for establishment of a 
3s, novo office of Union Bank, Furthermore, since Bank of Long Beach, 
^•A, has only a very small share of the deposits in its area, the 
amount of potential competition between the merging banks which would 
^e eliminated in this market area by the proposed transaction is not 
significant; at the same time, Union Bank's entry into the market 
acquisition of Bank of Long Beach, N.A. would likely increase 
competition among the large banks in the market.

On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
consummation of the proposal would not eliminate significant existing 
or potential competition. Considerations relating to the financial 
and managerial resources and future prospects of the banks are con-
sistent with approval of the application. Customers of Long Beach, 
N.A. would benefit by the merger because Union Bank plans to offer 
them an additional source of a wider range of banking services, such 
as computer and trust services, and through its larger lending limit 
would be better able to meet the needs of medium and large-sized 
business customers. Therefore, convenience and needs considerations 
lend support to approval of the application. It is the Board's 
judgment that consummation of the proposed merger would be in the 
public interest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered. On the basis of the findings summarized 
above, that said application be and hereby is approved, provided that 
fche merger so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth 
calendar day following the date of this Order, or (b) later than three 
m°nths after the date of this Order, unless such period is extended for 
good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
Pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, March 12, 1971. 
Voting for this action: Vice Chairman Robertson and Governors 
Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill. 
Absent and not voting: Chairman Burns.

ADDRESS OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE 
TO THE BOARD

First National City Overseas 
Investment Corporation, 
399 Park Avenue, 
New York, New York.

Gentlemen: 
In response to your letter of January 7, 1971, the Board 
of Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("FNCOIC") to pur-
chase and hold all the shares of Nessus Investment Corporation ("NIC") 
and Yonder Investment Corporation ("YIC") to be incorporated in 
Delaware, with a capital of $1,000 each, provided such shares are 
acquired within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of NIC and YIC by FNCOIC is granted subject to the condi-
tion that NIC and YIC will restrict their activities to the holding 
of shares of foreign financial corporations other than banks, the 
purchase and holding of which is permissible at that time for FNCOIC, 
and that FNCOIC will cause NIC and YIC (1) to permit examiners selected 
or auditors approved by the Board to examine NIC and YIC, and (2) to 
furnish the Board with such reports as it may require from time to 
time including reports of share acquisitions or dispositions as described 
in Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K. 
The Board also grants consent for FNCOIC to make additional 
investments in NIC and YIC through the transfer of shares in foreign 
financial corporations other than banks as a contribution to the sur-
plus of NIC and YIC. This consent includes the transfer of shares 
held by FNCOIC of Credivit S.A., Namur, Belgium, as set forth in your 
letter of January 7, 1971.

Upon corapleti on of the proposed acquisitions, it is re-
quested that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal 
Re serve Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association 
Memorandum of Association, and By-Laws of the corporations. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding that 
the investments now being approved will be made within the guidelines 
established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect 
as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities of 
First National City Bank and its subsidiaries, and that due consideration 
is being given to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours,

Item No. 7

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
FIRST MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL CORPORATION, 
Westwood, Massachusetts, 
for approval of action to become a bank 
holding company through the acquisition 
of 51 per cent or more of the voting 
shares of Massachusetts Bank- and Trust 
Company, Brockton, Massachusetts. 
ORDER APPROVING ACTION TO BECOME 
A BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(1)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by First Massachusetts Financial 
Corporation, Westwood, Massachusetts, for the Board's prior approval 
of action whereby Applicant would become a bank holding company 
through the acquisition of 51 per cent or more of the voting shares 
of Massachusetts Bank and Trust Company, Brockton, Massachusetts.

- 2 -
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
Written notice of receipt of the application to the Massachusetts 
Commissioner of Banks and requested her views and recommendation. 
The Commissioner recommended approval of the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on February 19, 1971 (36 Federal Register 3221), 
Providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
^as forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
c°nsideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and 
a l l those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
Effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
and managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant 
and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the 
immunities to be served, and finds that: 
Applicant is a nonoperating corporation formed for the 
Purpose of acquiring Bank (deposits $8.6 million). As it has no 
Resent operations or subsidiaries, consummation of the proposal 
V,°uld eliminate neither existing nor potential competition. On 
contrary, the acquisition would, as noted below, have a pro-
s p e c t i v e effect by strengthening one of the three commercial banking 
^ernatives in the City of Brockton. 

Considerations relating to the financial and managerial 
resources of Bank lend strong support toward approval of the appli-
cation.* Bank suffers from a substantial capital weakness and, as 
part of the proposal, and in an attempt to remedy this situation, 
Applicant will immediately place new capital into Bank through the 
purchase of common stock. Applicant further proposes to provide 
additional capital to Bank, if needed, at the conclusion of the 
first year after acquisition. Applicant proposes managerial changes 
which should also serve to strengthen Bank and both changes should 
permit it to become a viable competitor in Brockton. Both the 
Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation have strongly recommended approval of the applica-
tion, in both cases on the basis of considerations concerning the 
banking factors. While there is no evidence that substantial 
banking needs of the Brockton community are going unserved, the 
proposal would benefit the convenience and needs of the community 
by strengthening a convenient local source of banking services. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the com-
munities to be served thus lend additional weight toward approval 
of the application. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest, and that the 
application should be approved. 

It is hereby ordered, for the reasons set forth aboVe, 
that said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the 
acquisition so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the 
thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order or (b) 
later than three months after the date of this Order, unless such 
period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, March 12, 1971. 
Voting for this action: Vice Chairman Robertson and 
Governors Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill. 
Absent and not voting: Chairman Burns.
