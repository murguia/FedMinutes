In connection with Items 2 and 3, Governor Robertson expressed 
some concern about the extent to which banks, through their Edge sub-
sidiaries, were investing in a wide variety of businesses. During 
j • 
iscussion it was noted that in these particular cases the investments 
could formerly have been made under the general consent provisions of 
^egulation K (Corporations Engaged in Foreign Banking and Financing 
under the Federal Reserve Act), and Governor Robertson suggested that 
when Mr. Dahl's study on the foreign operations of U.S. banks was com-
pleted the Board should take another look at the overall picture. 
In connection with Item No. 11, the Legal Division in a memo-
randum dated August 20, 1968, had raised the question of possible anti-
t*>" 
implications of this international joint venture. 
It concluded 
tha £ the record did not contain sufficient information to permit reach-
n8 a definite opinion on the competitive effects domestically, thus 
raisin 
n8 the question whether further investigation was warranted. Com-
ments h-, 
°y members of the Board reflected reluctance to pursue the matter 
^Urthe 
r at this time (by attempting to obtain more information) in the 
absence * guidelines which it was understood the staff was developing 
assist the Board in determining what procedures should be followed 
as a r> 
general practice.

National Bank of Gardner, Gardner, Massachusetts, was approved unani-
mously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The con-
clusion read as follows: 
No significant competition exists between The Safety 
Fund National Bank of Fitchburg and The First National 
Bank of Gardner, although there is potential for increased 
competition between them through de novo branching. Con-
summation of the proposed consolidation might enable the 
resulting institution to compete somewhat more effectively 
with branches of the substantially larger Worcester County 
National Bank. The overall competitive effect would be 
slightly adverse.-
After discussion, the transmittal of a report to the Comptroller 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The Hackettstown National Bank, Hackettstown, New Jersey, 
into The First National Bank of Washington, Washington, New Jersey, was 
•^HEj^ved, although Governor Robertson expressed a preference for use of 
th 
term "adverse" as suggested by the Examinations Department of the 
eral Reserve Bank of New York. As transmitted, the conclusion read 
a s follows: 
TIL 
There would appear to be a small amount of competition 
existing between The Hackettstown National Bank and The 
First National Bank of Washington and potential for more. 
The overall competitive effect of the merger would be 
slight ly adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
erger of Russell County National Bank, Honaker, Virginia, into Wash-
ington T 
irust Bank, Bristol, Virginia, was approved unanimously for 
tfa Srnittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the conclu-
s l 
° n b e i n g stated as follows:

Consummation of the proposed merger of Washington 
Trust Bank, Bristol, Virginia, a subsidiary of Virginia 
Commonwealth Bankshares, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, a 
registered bank holding company, with Russell County 
National Bank, Honaker, Virginia, would have no adverse 
competitive effects. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
erger of Pennville State Bank, Pennville, Indiana, into The Citizens 
Ra 1 
of Portland, Portland, Indiana, was approved unanimously for 
ransmittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The conclu-
sion read as follows: 
There is no meaningful competition between The 
Citizens Bank of Portland, Portland, Indiana, and 
Pennville State Bank, Pennville, Indiana, to be 
eliminated by the proposed merger. Overall, the 
transaction would have no adverse effects on compe-
tition. 
Application of Citizens State Bank. A memorandum from the

ivision of Supervision and Regulation dated August 7, 1968, and other 
pertinent papers had been distributed in connection with an applica-
tions 1 
n by The Citizens State Bank, Sturgis, Michigan, for permission to 
quire the assets and assume the deposit liabilities of E. Hill & 
Sons Cf-cate Bank & Trust Company, Colon, Michigan. The recommendations 
W e r e favorable. 
Following comments by Mr. Egertson, the application was approved 
unani 
m o u s ly> with the understanding that an appropriate order and state-
ment w ould be drafted for the Board's consideration.

record entry covering the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee

% further suggestions for changes had been received, and the entry 
w$isnow being submitted for final review. 
The release of the entry to the press on Monday, August 26, 
W a s approved unanimously. 
Advisory Committee on Truth in Lending (Item No. 12). There 
h a d b e e n distributed a Jiiemorandum from Governor Maisel dated August 20, 
l968, raising the question whether the size of the Advisory Committee 
n ^ t h in Lending should be increased from 20 to 22 so as to include 
representative of the mutual savings banks as well as another public 
^mber (to provide balance). Names of possible candidates were sug-
gested i n (-fog memorandum. 
In commenting on the matter, Governor Maisel stated that the 
^Xqci if-* 
e V i c e President of the National Association of Mutual Savings 
Bankg f ] 
^ 
nad expressed disappointment that no representative of that 
dustry w a s included on the Advisory Committee. The Association had 
been on 
" 
of the early supporters of the legislation and had contributed 
®igni f -» 
cantly to its final passage. Also, in addition to their con-
8iderabl e volume of retail mortgage lending, mutual savings banks were 
lmp0rt n t factors in other types of consumer lending. He (Governor 
Maisel) 
was more or less neutral with respect to the proposal, but 
Govern 
W 
Brimmer felt rather strongly in favor of it.

Governor Robertson observed that the Chairman of the Committee 
had recently expressed the view that a membership of 20 was an outside 
maximum for working purposes. Governor Robertson added that he was 
inclined to agree. He noted that if the Committee was increased out 
0 respect to one group there would be pressure for further enlarge-
mer*t to accommodate other groups. 
Governor Daane stated that he would share Governor Robertson's 
view. He suggested that qualified persons proposed for membership who 
not selected at this time could receive consideration as turnovers

Grover W. Ensley, 
Executive Vice President, 
National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, 
2°0 Park Avenue, 
New York, New York. 10017 
Dear Grover: 
The Board has seriously considered the problems raised 
c
y t h e f a ct that the Truth in Lending Advisory Committee, as now 
instituted, d o e s n o t include representatives of all segments of 
r
 e c°nsumer credit industry covered by the Act. The Board also 
^ecognizes that, among the groups not now represented on the 
^ommittee, some merit more consideration than others by virtue 
their past efforts on behalf of this legislation. After fur-
Co*r consideration, however, it was decided that the Advisory 
mmittee could not be increased in size without beginning to 
^eopardize its effectiveness as a working group. There will be 
s
U r n o v e r °f membership on the Committee and those qualified per-
ns suggested for membership who were not selected at this time 
1 1 be a prime source for the selection of replacements. 
As you know, the Advisory Committee is not the only 
enue of communication between the industry and the Federal 
: C B e r v e Sys 
tem on the Truth in Lending regulation. In fact, dis-
^ 
sion of the technical problems imposed by the regulation can 
o f "l0re effectively conducted on an individual basis for each type 
le , e n d e r than in a meeting including representatives of various 
Co** 6 r a n d retailer groups. You may be sure that we shall welcome 
W e , e n t s anc* suggestions from you and your associates as soon as 
have a draft of the regulation distributed for review. 
// ; . 
The Federal Reserve System has long enjoyed close and 
^rmonious working relationships with you and the National 
tL.°ciation of Mutual Savings Banks, and we hope to continue on 
ls mutually beneficial basis. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) Bob
