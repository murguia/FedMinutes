Allied Bank International. There were on today's agenda 
several matters relating to the affairs of Allied Bank International, 
New York, New York. 
The first question, discussed in a memorandum of December 3, 
1969, from the Division of Supervision and Regulation, involved 
the Board's deferment, on June 25, 1969, of action on the proposed 
participation of United States National Bank of Oregon, Portland, 
Oregon, as a stockholder of Allied. After reviewing the reasons why 
a decision on the matter had been deferred, along with additional 
information that had been obtained, the Division summarized the 
arguments for denial and for approval and expressed the view that 
the arguments in favor of approval were the more persuasive. 
Discussion of the question revealed a division of opinion 
among the Board members. Three members (Governors Robertson, Mitchell, 
and Brimmer) were inclined toward the view that United States National 
Bank should not be permitted to become a stockholder in Allied Bank 
as long as it continued to own its own Edge corporation, even though 
that corporation had been inactive and was of the "in-house" variety 
(located on the same premises as its parent bank). Within that group, 
some doubt also was expressed as to whether in any event it would be 
appropriate for a bank as large as United States National (with total 
assets of some $1.7 billion) to become a participant in Allied Bank. 

3785 
12/17/69

The other three members present were of the opinion that the 
granting of permission for United States National to become a stock-
holder in Allied Bank while retaining its Edge corporation would in 
fact be a pro-competitive move since it would admit the possibility 
that United States National, while a stockholder of Allied, might at 
the same time build up its Edge corporation to the extent that it would 
become a major competitor, in which event United States National might 
choose to withdraw from participation in Allied. 
Also discussed in the aforementioned memorandum of December 3, 
1969, were pending applications by four of Allied*s shareholding banks 
for permission to establish limited branch facilities in Nassau, Bahamas. 
(It was understood that other shareholding banks likewise had applications 
under active consideration.) 
Furthermore, as mentioned in the December 3 memorandum, and 
as presented more specifically in a memorandum of December 10, 1969, 
Allied Bank International had itself filed an application for permission 
to establish a Nassau branch. 
The Division expressed the opinion that in view of the 
special character and limited nature of Nassau branch facilities, the 
establishment of such facilities by banks that were shareholders in 
Allied would not raise serious anticompetitive questions and that in 
fact it might help to maintain a competitive environment between the 
participating banks and Allied. If the Board agreed, the Division 

3786 
12/17/69 
-4-
indicated that the applications by the individual banks would be 
processed and presented to the Board in accordance with the usual 
procedures. The Division also recommended approval of Allied's 
application to establish a Nassau branch. 
A discussion of the Nassau branch applications was interrupted 
when the meeting recessed to permit participation in a phase of the 
Board's Christmas program. When the meeting reconvened, at 11:05 a.m., 
it developed that Board members continued to have questions with regard 
to the appropriateness of approving the establishment of Nassau branch 
facilities by banks participating in Allied Bank or by Allied itself. 
One view was that it would be preferable to grant applications of the 
participating banks rather than to approve Allied's application, 
while another line of reasoning suggested that if banks chose to become 
affiliated with Allied they perhaps should not undertake Nassau operations 
themselves. 
There was also indicated to be some concern, about which 
Board members would like to reflect further, with regard to the 
general pattern and scope of Allied's operations as they appeared to 
be evolving. 
In the circumstances, it was suggested that all of the 
matters involving Allied Bank International that appeared on today's 
agenda be held over and that they be given further consideration as 
a package at a future meeting, hopefully one at which all of the 

3 7 8 7 
12/17/69 
-5-
members of the Board were present. There was agreement with this 
suggestion. 
The foregoing procedural agreement related not only to the 
matters heretofore mentioned but also to requests by Allied Bank 
International (1) for permission to issue, either directly or through 
a wholly-owned subsidiary, medium-term and long-term obligations up 
to a maximum amount of $100,000,000; (2) for a ruling that guarantees 
by Allied Bank of such obligations issued by the wholly-owned subsidiary 
did not come within the limitations contained in sections 211.9(b) and 
211.9(c) of Regulation K, Corporations Engaged in Foreign Banking and 
Financing under the Federal Reserve Act; and (3) for permission to 
exclude such obligations in applying the limitation on aggregate 
liab ilities contained in section 211.9(c) of Regulation K. 
During the course of today's discussion the staff, at the 
suggestion of Governor Brimmer, was requested to consider what problems 
might be involved if member banks of the Allied group desired to form 
Edge corporations for the specific purpose of investing in PEFCO (Private 
Export Funding Corporation). 
Nassau branch. An application by First National Bank of 
Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minnesota, for permission to establish a 
branch in Nassau, Bahamas, was approved, Governor Robertson dissenting 
and Governor Brimmer abstaining. A copy of the letter sent to the 
bank pursuant to this action is attached as Item No. 1. 

3788

In taking this action the Board was aware that another 
subsidiary bank of the same holding company (First National Bank of 
Saint Paul, St. Paul, Minnesota) was a shareholder in Allied Bank 
International, New York, New York, and had also applied for its own 
branch in Nassau. 
First National Corporation. The application of First 
National Corporation, Appleton, Wisconsin, to acquire shares of The 
Clintonville National Bank, Clintonville, Wisconsin, was approved 
unanimously, with the understanding that an order and statement 
reflecting the decision would be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Proposed credit card legislation. As stated in a memorandum 
from Mr. Cardon dated December 16, 1969, the Bureau of the Budget had 
asked for a report on a revised draft bill to restrict the unsolicited 
wailing of credit cards and to limit the liability of cardholders. 
The draft bill would require those who made unsolicited mailings to 
send pre-mailers 45 days in advance notifying the addressee that 
a card would be sent and providing him a stamped, addressed return 
form for use if he wanted to refuse the card. It would also require 
issuers to include with mailed cards a statement notifying the recipient 
Â°f his right to refuse the card and of the limits on his liability. 
The bill would fix a limit of $50 on liability for the unauthorized 
use of a card, and that liability could arise only under certain 
conditions. 

3783 
12/17/69 
-7-
In broad outlines, the bill appeared to Mr. Cardon to carry 
out the Board's previous recommendations, including the recommendation 
that the rules be spelled out in the statute rather than giving the 
Board, or any other agency, the duty of spelling them out in regulations. 
Enforcement responsibilities would be divided up in the same way as 
under the Truth in Lending Act. Nevertheless, Mr. Cardon understood 
that some Board members had expressed concern about the possibility that 
different enforcement agencies might interpret the statute differently. 
Governor Brimmer commented that the draft bill was a product 
of the interagency conference he had mentioned at a recent Board meeting. 
It represented a negotiated settlement, one to which he believed that 
the agencies concerned would generally subscribe. As Mr. Cardon had 
indicated, there might still be a question with regard to the proposed 
distribution of responsibilities among the various agencies; also, he 
would hope that the Board, in its response to the Budget Bureau, would 
s uggest further consideration of a requirement for the use of a double 
envelope procedure in connection with the mailing of credit cards or 
notices of intent to mail such cards. In all the circumstances, 
however, he would drop the position that no legislation was needed in 
this area and support the proposed legislation generally, although 
w i t h the recognition that its passage might impose some additional 
burden upon the Board, particularly at the staff level. In the 
n egotiations he had advanced the thought that it might be desirable 

12/17/69 
-8-
to have the statute implemented by regulations that could be changed 
as necessary rather than to have everything imbedded in the statute, 
but he gathered that such a position probably would not be supported 
because it would raise questions as to where responsibility for the 
issuance of regulations should be lodged. 
After a discussion during which general agreement was 
expressed with Governor Brimmer's comments, it was agreed that the 
Board's position in replying to the Budget Bureau should be one of 
supporting the proposed legislation as a whole, that no question 
should be raised about whether there should be provision for the prescribing 
Â°f regulations interpreting the statute, and that a suggestion should be 
made that further consideration be given to including a requirement for 
a double envelope procedure. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Budget Bureau pursuant to the 
foregoing understanding is attached as Item No. 2. 
H.R. 7491. As stated in a memorandum from Mr. Cardon dated 
December 16, 1969, the Bureau of the Budget had asked for a report on 
enrolled bill H.R. 7491, which would expand the powers of States to 
tax national banks. The bill provided that after January 1, 1972, a 
n ational bank would be treated as a State bank for the purposes of 
Federal and State taxation. Until then (1) the home State could 
lmPÂ°se any nondiscriminatory tax other than a tax on intangible 
Personal property, and (2) other States could impose nondiscriminatory 

3791. 
12/17/69 
-9-
sales and use taxes, documentary stamp taxes and similar taxes on 
documents, taxes on tangible personal property, and other fees or 
taxes on ownership"or use of personal property. 
The bill also directed the Board of Governors to study 
the impact of the amendment slated to take effect January 1, 1972, and 
to report to the Congress by December 31, 1970. The study was to 
determine the probable impact of the amendment on the banking systems 
and other economic effects, and the Board was to consult with the 
Treasury and with State banking and tax authorities. The report was 
to include recommendations as to what additional Federal legislation, 
if any, might be needed to reconcile promotion of the economic 
efficiency of the banking systems of the nation with achievement of 
effectiveness and local autonomy in meeting the fiscal needs of the 
States and their political subdivisions. 
Pursuant to Mr. Cardon's recommendation, it was agreed 
unanimously to send to the Budget Bureau a letter recommending that 
the bill be signed by the President. A copy of the letter sent 
Pursuant to this action is attached as Item No. 3. 
It was understood that a proposal would be submitted for the 
Board's consideration on arrangements that might be made for conducting 
the study that would be required if the bill was signed. 
H.R. 15091. As stated in a memorandum from the Division of 
Research and Statistics dated December 16, 1969, the Chairman of the 

3 7 9 2 
12/17/69 
-10-
Senate Banking and Currency Committee had requested the Board's 
views on the provisions of section 4 of H.R. 15091, a bill to extend 
interest rate ceiling controls and for other purposes that had been 
ordered reported out by the House Banking and Currency Committee. 
Section 4 of the bill would attempt to improve the depth 
and liquidity of the secondary home mortgage market by authorizing the 
j.,-
Federal Home Loan Banks, under the direction of the Home Loan Bank 
i 
Board and acting through such agencies and instrumentalities as that 
Board might deem appropriate, to buy, service, sell, hold, and 
otherwise deal in mortgages originated by members of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank System or by any insured bank or insured savings and loan 
association. No outer limits would be set on the scope of the secondary 
niarket operations of the Federal Home Loan Banks. 
With the memorandum there had been submitted a draft of 
Proposed report, the language of which was intended to be consistent 
with the Board's earlier position on this type of question, particularly 
as expressed in a letter of November 13, 1969, to the Chairman of the 
Senate Banking and Currency Committee with reference to S. 2958, a 
bill to authorize the Federal National Mortgage Association to purchase, 
service, sell, lend on the security of, or otherwise deal in conventional 
Mortgages. However, section 4 of H.R. 15091 raised a number of additional 
questions, as noted in the December 16 memorandum, and they also were 
discussed in the proposed report. 

3733 
12/11/69 
-11-
At today's meeting Mr. Cardon summarized majority and 
minority views expressed in the House Committee report, copies of 
which had become available only this morning. 
Members of the Board noted that a fundamental change in 
the character of operations of the Federal Home Loan Banks would be 
involved, that there appeared to be several points of concern, but 
that it was difficult to appraise the weight that should be given to 
those questions in the relatively short time provided for consideration 
Â°f them. It was not clear that an immediate need for the legislation 
existed, which suggested that an adequate opportunity should be 
provided for consideration of points of concern such as had been 
mentioned before the legislation was enacted. 
In light of the foregoing discussion it was agreed that 
the draft of letter to Chairman Sparkman should be revised to indicate 
lri what respects the Board was concerned about the implications of 
the proposed legislation, which obviously would involve a fundamental 
change in the operations of the Home Loan Banks, and to suggest that 
those circumstances the legislation should not be enacted without 
thorough study. The letter, as rewritten, would not take a position 
ift opposition to such legislation, but it would express the view that 
the legislation should be considered very carefully. 
Accordingly, unanimous approval was given to a letter to 
chairman Sparkman in the form attached as Item No. 4.

The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Officer 'salariesÂ« 
Pursuant to the recommendation of the 
Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, as set 
forth in a memorandum of December 16, 1969, the Board approved 
unanimously payment of salaries to the officers of ten Federal 
Reserve Banks (all except New York and Minneapolis) at the annual 
rates fixed by the Boards of Directors of the respective Banks, 
effective January 1, 1970. Copies of the letters sent to the Banks 
pursuant to the Board's action are attached as Items 5-14, inclusive. 
There followed an executive session at the request of 
Governor Sherrill, after which the meeting adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to First National Bank of Minneapolis, 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 
the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, 
a n d 
t o operate and maintain such branch subject to the provisions 
such Section and of Regulation M. 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
ranch will be used for developing new international business and 
|jot as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
nited Stages. It is also understood that there is to be no contact 
yith the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, staff, 
and bookkeeping ;nay, at least in part, be supplied under contract 
y another party. In view of the unusual character of this opera-
l 0 n >
 
t h e foregoing permission is granted subject to continuing 
sPecial observation and review by the Board and after due notice 
a y b e withdrawn or modified. The foregoing permission is also 
8ranted on the condition that adequate information covering the 
ranch's operations will be maintained st your head office and will 
available to the Board and its accredited representatives. The 
oard should be promptly informed of any modification in the branch's 
n-thods of operation, including changes in any contract under which 
S crvices are supplied to the branch. 
, 
> 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
J
lsiness on or before January 1, 1971, all rights granted hereby 
l all be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date. 
^ 
Please advise the Board of Governor*.;, through the Federal 
f u
e s e r v e Bank of Minneapolis when the branch is opened for business, 
H
 r r ushing information as to the exact location of the branch. The 
t ?
a r d should also be promptly informed of any future change in loca-
n 
the branch in Nassau.

Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits 
payable only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the 
States of the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt 
from any limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 
and Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D (but see Sec-
tion 213.7 of Regulation M). The general purpose of these exemptions 
is to allow foreign branches of United States banks to compete abroad 
with foreign banks. In these circumstances, it has long been and 
continues to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System to discourage 
deposits ty United States residents at foreign branches of United 
States banks unless such deposits have been placed to serve a defi-
nite, necessary purpose in connection with foreign or international 
transactions outside the United States. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
funds provided by home office (whether i_n the form of allocated capi-
tal, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign assets 
for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. In view of the 
Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign investments on 
the balance of payments, the above consent is given with the under-
standing that in the conduct of the branch's operations maximum 
reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the United 
States. Accordingly, it is understood that any investment required 
will be made within the guidelines established under the foreign 
credit restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the foreign 
lending and investment activities of your bank, and that due con-
sideration is being given to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Dear Mr. Rommel: 
This will confirm the information telephoned earlier 
today to Mr. Reeve regarding the B o a r d
1 v i e w s on the revised 
draft Consumer Credit Card Protection Act of 1.969, which 
accompanied your memorandum of December 15. 
The Board favors enactment of the draft legislation. 
In major respects, it conforms with previous recommendations 
of the Board. It would allow continued use of unsolicited 
mailings, which we believe is essential to enable new competitors 
to enter the field. At the same time, it would write into the 
statute limitations on cardholders' liability for unauthorized 
use of credit cards along with some restrictions on unsolicited 
mailings designed to protect consumers withoui barring entry inuo 
the field through this marketing technique. We believe that by 
specifying in the statute reasonable limitations on liability, 
the Congress could go a long way toward solving the remaining 
problems associated with unsolicited mailings. And we believe 
the restrictions on unsolicited mailings and '.limits on liability 
should be specified in the statute rather than fixed by administra-
tive regulation. 
At the same time, the Board recommends that the 
legislation provide, that issuers who mail unsolicited credit 
cards must use unmarked envelopes enclosing (1) an unmarked 
return envelope containing the card, and (2) a statement notifying

the addressee of the contents of the return envelope and that the 
card may be refused merely by depositing the unopened return 
envelope in the nearest post office or letter box. We think this 
would give to consumers who feel uneasy about throwing an unwanted 
card away a relatively simple alternative, which would be less 
trouble than destroying the card.

The Honorable John J. Sparkman, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
United States Senate, 
Washington, D. C. 
Bear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your request of December 13, 1969, 
.. 
_ 
. t 
asking for the Board*s views on section 4 of H.R. 15091, which 
would authorize, the Federal Home Loan Banks, under the direction 
of th e Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to deal in mortgages originated 
by members or by any FSLIC-insured or FDIC-insured institution, as 
a means of improving the depth and liquidity of the secondary home 
mortgage market. 
The provisions of section 4 would obviously go well beyond 
existing authority, under which the Federal Home Loan Banks have 
already extended a record amount of advances to member savings and 
loan associations this year. They would, in fact, authorize a 
substantial restructuring of the secondary mortgage market as well 
as the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each of these far-reaching 
proposed changes deserves careful consideration. 
As the Board has noted on previous occasions, appropriate 
further improvements in the secondary as well as the primary 
mortgage market would clearly be in the public interest. However, 
the provisions of section 4 raise a number of important policy and 
technical questions, aside from the issue of whether a chartering, 
insuring, and supervisory authority should deal in individual 
mortgages and thereby extend aid to its members by purchasing their 
long-term assets as well as by making short- or imterim-term advances 
which may be secured by mortgages. Among these questions is the 
issue of whether authority to deal in either conventional or 

The Honorable John J . Sparkman 
Â»2-
o t 
o ^ O i 
Government underwritten mortgages, as section 4 would permit, 
should be placed in F N M or in the Federal Home Loan Banks. 
Another concern is the effect that additional borrowing by the 
Federal Home Loan Banks, which would be required to finance their 
acquisitions o:: mortgages in the secondary market, might have on 
(a) the ability of the System to raise funds for its more basic 
function of making advances to member associations; (b) the price 
which would have to be paid for such borrowings and charged for 
advances; and (c) the capital structure of e System which would 
be partly engaged in dealing in conventional mortgages lacking 
the uniform minimum standards relating to safety of principal, 
collateral, loan terms, and originating practices which are 
typical of Government underwritten mortgagest 
Particularly in this connection, it should be noted that 
the provisions of section 4 would place no limits on the scope 
or nature of Federal Home Loan Bank secondary mortgage operations. 
Unlike existing legislation directly or indirectly governing 
1
?NMA
5s operations, section 4 would impose no restrictions on the 
type or quality of mortgages eligible for Federal Home Loan Bank 
purchase, the range of prices which might be paid for such loans, 
the aggregate amount of Federal Home Loan Bank mortgage holdings, 
or whether income derived from the secondary market operations of 
the Federal Hone Loan Banks would have to be fully self-supporting. 
With all the above considerations in mind and in view of 
existing authority permitting member or insured savings and loan 
associations to participate their mortgage holdings, to borrow from 
the Federal Hone Loan Banks, and to pool mortgages with or without 
a GNMA guarantee, the Board suggests that fucther study of the 
questions mentioned above would be appropriate. It is unlikely 
that enactment of section 4 would increase the net flow of funds 
into home mortgages in the months immediately ahead, given the 
high cost and lelatively limited availability of funds to finance 
the Federal Home Loan Bank System's present operations. 
Since section 4 would not solve tha problems currently 
facing the mortgage market, Congress should take the time to 
consider the substantial issues it would raise regarding the long-
run structure c>f the Federal Home Loan Bank System and its relation 
to the operations of the Federal National Mortgage Association in 
particular and the secondary mortgage market in general. 
Sincerely yours,
