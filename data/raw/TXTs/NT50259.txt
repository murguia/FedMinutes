Mr. Richard J. Ragan, Secretary-Treasurer, 
Fiduciary Income Shares, Inc., 
Fiduciary Equity Shares, Inc., 
33 North High Street, 
Columbus, Ohio. 43215 
Dear Mr. Ragan: 
This is in response to your letter of March 11, 1968, 
transmitted to the Board through the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland, in which you inquire whether officers, directors, or 
employees of Fiduciary Income Shares, Inc. and Fiduciary Equity 
Shares, Inc. may at the same time be officers / directors, or 
employees of a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, 
in view of the prohibition in section 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 
(12 U.S.C. 78) against interlocking relationships between such a 
bank and a corporation "primarily engaged" in the issue, flotation, 
underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. 
The Board understands that the corporations are authorized 
Pursuant to §§ 1109.32-1109.42 of the Ohio Revised Code "to consti-
tute a medium for the common investment of trust funds held in a 
iduciary capacity and for true fiduciary purposes, either alone or 
with one or more co-fiduciaries, by state banks with trust powers, 
trust companies, and national banks with trust powers." The corpo-
rations may issue their stock only to such fiduciaries. Such fidu-
ciaries may redeem such stock, but otherwise may not transfer it 
except to qualified successor fiduciaries. Operation of the corpo-
rations is subject to certain limitations specified by statute, and 
to regulation and supervision by the Ohio Superintendent of Banks in 
same manner as the Superintendent regulates and supervises Ohio-
bartered banks and trust companies. Except upon the specific approv-
al of the Superintendent, stockholders in the corporations are pro-
tu 
f r o m advertising or publicizing their participation therein. 
here will be no interlocking relationship between the corporations 
and the bank that is awarded a contract as manager-custodian. 
t 
Individual banks have for decades been authorized collectively 
0 invest funds held by them as a trustee, executor, administrator, or 
Suardian. The impetus to establishment of these Ohio corporations - as 

1480 
•V- Mr. Richard J. Ragan 
-2-
Jir -
. ' - V v . 
* -
was the case with similar corporations in New York, Connecticut, and 
Maine with respect to which the Board has previously indicated that 
interlocking relationships between such corporations and member banks 
are not prohibited by the provisions of section 32 - is to provide an 
alternative vehicle for collective investment of such funds. 
- .V, '.O.'.v . 
As in such earlier cases, neither of the Ohio corporations 
will engage in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or 
distribution, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate partici-
pation, of any stocks, bonds or other similar securities, except shares 
of its own stock. Ownership of such stock will, as indicated, be lim-
ited 
to banks and trust companies acting for fiduciary (as distinguished 
from investment) accounts and be subject to supervision in the same man-
ner as banks and trust companies. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that section 32 does not 
Prohibit officers, directors, or employees of Fiduciary Income Shares, 
Inc. and Fiduciary Equity Shares, Inc. from serving at the same time as 
officers, directors, or employees of a member bank. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Assistant Secretary.

Dear Mr. Wallace: 
There is enclosed a copy of a letter which has been 
forwarded to Mr. W. Braddock Hickman pertaining to the program 
for the separation of silver and clad coin. 
In th is letter the Board has recommended that the 
Federal Reserve Banks accept the program as outlined in your 
letter of April 9, and assume the costs of the two additional 
AMF machines as well as the related costs for the five machines 
tthich the Mint will make available to the System. Please note 
that we also recommend that the System act on your suggestion 
that a smaller type separating machine be installed where it is 
economical to operate such equipment rather than transship the 
Nixed coin for separation at some other Reserve or Mint office. 
The Board looks forward to the early implementation 
°f this program by the Reserve Banks. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon

Deputy Secretary.

Mr. W. Braddock Hickman, Chairman, 
Committee on Currency and Coin, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 
44101 
Dear Mr. Hickman: 
#•„ „u 
Further reference is made to correspondence pertaining 
to the program of separating silver and clad coin, particularly the 
letter dated April 9, 1968, received from Mr. Robert A. Wallace 
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, a copy of which is attached. 
The Board believes that, under the circumstances, it is 
appropriate for the Reserve Banks to proceed with the program as 
suggested by the Treasury in its letter. Specifically, it is 
recommended that: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
The Treasury be requested to place an order for 
two (2) additional AMF machines. 
The purchase price and related costs of these 
two machines and the related costs attached to the 
procurement of the five AMF machines the Mint is 
making available, be assumed by the System. 
The Subcommittee on Currency and Coin review the 
allocation of the AMF equipment to determine the 
most efficient placement of the seven machines 
with the objectives being (a) to produce an imme-
diate return to circulation of the largest amount 
possible of clad coin; (b) to relieve congested 
vaults; and (c) to provide either for the subsequent 
relocation of the machines or the transshipment of 
mixed coins from other offices for separation as 
the study and attending conditions would appear to 
indicate. 

Mr. W. Braddock Hickman 
- 2 -
4. The Subcommittee also study the costs involved 
in the transshipment and separation of the mixed 
coin at Federal Reserve or Mint offices where 
AMF machines will be installed as compared with 
the cost of purchasing and operating the smaller-
type separating machine in the other Reserve 
offices. 
5. The Subcommittee determine upon a smaller-type 
separating machine and purchase a sufficient 
number to install at least one such machine in 
each Federal Reserve office where the above study 
indicates it is economical to do so. 
6. All the costs mentioned above be considered a 
System Project cost to be paid in the initial 
instance by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 
and to be prorated to all Reserve Banks on an 
equitable basis as determined by the Subcommittee. 
We are enclosing a copy of the Board's letter to Assistant 
Secretary Wallace advising him of the Board's position on this matter, 
Very truly yours, 
X,
