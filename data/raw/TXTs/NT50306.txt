Reports on competitive factors. A report to the Federal 
deposit Insurance Corporation on the competitive factors involved in 
the proposed consolidation of Federal Loan and Building Association,

Portland, Maine, with Maine Savings Bank, also of Portland, was 
r^i'ijfi if' 
S££roved unanimously for transmittal to the Corporation in a form 
in which the conclusion read as follows: 
The proposed consolidation of Federal Loan and Building 
Association, Portland, and Maine Savings Bank, Portland, would 
eliminate a significant amount of existing competition and fur-
ther increase the concentration of time and savings deposits 
in the Portland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
While 
numerous alternatives for time and savings accounts and mort-
gage loans will remain in the area, the competitive effect of 
the proposed consolidation would be adverse. 
A report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the competitive 
A c t o r s involved in the proposed merger of Industrial National Bank of 
Rhode Island, Providence, Rhode Island, with Hope National Bank, also 
Providence, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comp-

ville, Alabama, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comp-
troller in a form in which the conclusion read as follows: 
Some competition exists between The First National Bank 
of Huntsville and Farmers & Merchants Bank, Madison. 
Since 
numerous alternative banking facilities will remain in the 
relevant area, the overall competitive effect would be 
slightly adverse. 
Meeting; 
with State bank supervisors. 
Chairman Martin referred 
t o a letter dated July 18, 1968, in which Mr. Wille, Superintendent of 
Tj , s 
o f the State of New York, requested, on behalf of the Board of 
Dir 
e c t o r s of the National Association of Supervisors of State Banks, 
n opportunity for several of the supervisors to meet with as many 
A m b e r s of the Board as possible for the purpose of discussing bank 
r egulatory problems. 
The request was stated to have been prompted 
Particularly by recent announcements by several large State member 
banks 
c « 
or their intention to convert to national charters. 
It was

Proposed to include in the meeting representatives of several of the 
largest State member banks of the country, the supervisors of their 
respective States, and the President of the National Association of 
Supervisors of State Banks. 
Chairman Martin suggested that the Board agree to meet with 
r« Wille's group at a mutually convenient time when a minimum of five 
members of the Board could be present. 
Governor Mitchell suggested that such a meeting would be more 
c: •. 
eaningful if the Board had reached at least tentative conclusions by 
that time with respect to operations subsidiaries and related matters. 
F urther comments revealed that the members of the Board were in agree-
m e n t 
w i t h Chairman Martin's recommendation that a meeting be arranged 
a n d also with Governor Mitchell's suggestion. Accordingly, Chairman 
Martin was authorized to arrange a meeting on one of several alterna-
t i V e 
d a t e s on which it appeared that all members of the Board would 
be 
Present, and it was also agreed that before the date of the meeting 
he Board would give further consideration to matters such as the prob-
operations subsidiaries that it appeared likely the visiting 
lem of 
gr°up would bring up.
