Mr. W. J. Riether

New York, New York 
10022 
Dear Mr, Riether: 
This refers to your letter of September 19, 
1 9 6 7 , and. 
its enclosure, concerning your notice to the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System dated S e p t e m b e r 
8 , 
1 9 6 6 , which 
advised, pursuant to Regulation M, of your bank's intention to 
establish an additional branch in Jamaica, to be located in the 
Halfway Tree area of K i n g s t o n . 
In its reply of September 21, 
1966, the Board informed your bank that unless the branch was 
established and opened for business on or before October 1, 
1 9 6 7 , 
it would be deemed that plans for the establishment of the branch 
had been abandoned. 
You now indicate that delays have been encountered which 
will prevent your opening this branch until the end of this year 
or early in 
1 9 6 8 . 
Accordingly, on behalf of the Board, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, acting under delegated authority, extends 
to A p r i l 1, 1 9 6 8 , the date specified in the Board's letter of 
September 21, 1966. 
We would ask that, when the branch is opened for business 
you inform our Bank Examinations Department of the effective date 
of opening and the address of the branch. 
Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by signing and 
returning the enclosed copy. 
V e r y — t r u l y yours, 
;
