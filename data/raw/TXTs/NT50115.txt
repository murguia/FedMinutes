Report on competitive factors. There had been distributed a 
draft of report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of The Grove City 
National Bank, Grove City, Pennsylvania, with Northwest Pennsylvania 
Bank & Trust Co., Oil City, Pennsylvania. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that the relevant market 
area had not been correctly identified. He suggested that the staff 
b® asked to obtain additional information on that point, including 
^formation from the Cleveland Reserve Bank as necessary, prior to 
father consideration of the report by the Board at another meeting. 
There was agreement with that suggestion. 
Federal Savings Bank Act and Federal Savings Association Act 
There had been distributed a memorandum dated July 14, 1967, 
fr°m the Legal Division relating to requests from the Chairmen of the 
Senate and House Banking and Currency Committees for reports on S. 1919 
a n d H.R. 10745, respectively, identical bills to authorize the estab-
lishment of Federal mutual savings banks, and from the Chairman of the 

2885

Senate Banking and Currency Committee for a report on S. 1955, the 
"Federal Savings Association Act of 1967," which the United States 
Savings and Loan League was urging as alternative legislation. 
The memorandum pointed out that S. 1919 and H.R. 10745 were 
basically the same as the proposal drafted by the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board that was considered by the Board of Governors in March 1967. 
At that time the Board indicated to the Bureau of the Budget that it 
had no objection in principle to the type of legislation proposed. How-
ever, it questioned certain aspects of the proposal. The Board also 
suggested that "a comprehensive study of the role of the nation's 
depository-type financial institutions by a broad gauge commission with 
a view to legislation eliminating inequities, increasing competition, 
and providing more adequate financial services and facilities for the 
American public would be most useful at this time." Attached to the 
memorandum was a draft of report on S. 1919 and H.R. 10745 that would 
b e consistent with the March 1967 report to the Budget Bureau. 
The memorandum also submitted a synopsis of S. 1955, reportedly 
Prepared by its sponsors. That bill would offer a new type of Federal 
charter, with broader investment and loan powers, that would be avail-
a^le to existing mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations, 
a s well as to new organizations, with the label in terms of "association" 
rather than "bank." It was the recommendation of the Legal Division 
ttlat the report to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee be couched 

J 2 8 S 6 
7/19/67

in terms consistent with the approach to the Federal mutual savings 
bank proposal, particularly with respect to the suggestion for a com-
prehensive study of the appropriate role of all depository-type finan-
cial institutions. Attached to the memorandum was a draft of report 
Prepared along such lines. 
Mr. Sanders observed that S. 1919 and H.R. 10745 were similar 
to previous proposals to which the Board had not objected in principle. 
s« 1955, which contemplated a comprehensive revision and recodification 
°f the law relating to Federal savings and loan associations, would 
Permit such associations to enlarge the scope of their competition with 
commercial banks, but without subjecting them to reserve and other 
requirements comparable to those imposed upon commercial banks. How-
ler, certain features were common to all of the bills. If the Board 
commented adversely on S. 1955, that might appear to reflect a bias in 
favor of mutual savings banks. He suggested that the Board might prefer 
t o withhold comments on S. 1955. 
Governor Maisel proposed a rearrangement of the material in the 
draft report on S. 1919 and H.R. 10745 that would emphasize the sugges-
tion for a comprehensive study of the role of all depository-type finan-
c i al institutions, particularly in terms of the relationship to the 
financing of housing. 
Other members of the Board agreed with the proposed rearrange-
ment but preferred not to suggest that such a study be geared to the 
fdancing of housing.

Mr. Cardon questioned the advisability of proposing such a study 
to the Banking and Currency Committees at this stage. If the suggestion 
was intended merely as an admonition that the Committees should study 
the broad area within their jurisdiction, he felt it would probably be 
useless. On the other hand, if the suggestion was directed at the par-
ticular legislation, he believed the better course would be for the 
Board to make specific recommendations. 
During discussion of this point Governor Mitchell said that 
what he would have in mind was to stress the need for analysis of the 
competitive aspects of the depository institution business. He suggested 
that the 1963 Report of the Committee on Financial Institutions might 
furnish a background on which to build such an analysis, which could be 
keyed to the problems involved in the offering of Federal charters to 
mutual savings banks. 
Governor Brimmer remarked that an alternative approach would be 
to offer specific recommendations with respect to the mutual savings 
bank bill, indicate that the Board would have no objection to such a 
bill if those points were taken into account, but reiterate the need 
a comprehensive study. 
Governor Robertson suggested that Governor Maisel's proposal 
f o r rearrangement of the report would appear to offer the framework for 
S u ch an approach, and the latter agreed that some redrafting of the 
Critical portion of the report might usefully be attempted.

In further discussion Mr. Cardon expressed the view that the 
mutual savings bank bill, which had Administration support, was likely 
to receive favorable Congressional consideration, with some compromises. 
Governor Brimmer observed that this raised the question what 
basic position the Board should adopt at this stage; that is, whether 
lt should attempt to obstruct action on the bill, by suggesting that a 
broad study should first be made, or whether it should point up specific 
issues for consideration. 
Governor Maisel suggested that the Board list in its report the 
Points it considered most important and say that it believed thorough 
consideration of those points in the final drafting of the legislation 
was critical. 
The Board then proceeded to discussion of a number of points to 
which it was suggested that reference might be made in the report, and 
it was agreed that further consideration would be given to the report 
° n the basis of a revised draft that would reflect the tenor of the 
discussion. 
It was understood that a report on S. 1955 would be deferred, 
My 
Cardon having advised that there was no particular pressure for 
Such a report at this time. 
Interest equalization tax. Governor Robertson reported that 
i n response to a question raised with him by a Treasury official this 
m°rning he had stated that so far as he knew the Board had not changed

its position, reported to the House Committee on Ways and Means by 
letter dated February 20, 1967, in favor of continuing the interest 
equalization tax for an additional two years while permitting its appl 
cation in a more flexible manner. Governor Robertson said he had indi 
cated that the Treasury could so state if the question arose during 
forthcoming Congressional hearings. 
There was no indication of disagreement. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Board of Directors, 
Houston Bank & Trust Company, 
Houston, Texas. 
Gentlemen: 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 24A of the Federal 
Reserve Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
approves an investment in bank premises of not to exceed $600,000 
by Houston Bank & Trust Company for the construction of a parking 
garage on the Scanlan Block in Houston, Texas. 
In approving this application, the Board has given careful 
consideration to your bank's present heavy investment, direct and 
indirect, in bank premises and less than satisfactory capital position. 
The Board's approval is based on its understanding that the capital 
funds of your bank are to be increased in the immediate future by 
$1,060,000 through the sale of new common stock. Further, the Board's 
approval is based on the assumption that action will be taken toward 
another substantial increase in capital funds no later than early 
1969. 
Your bank has enjoyed exceptional deposit growth and in 
order that such growth and future growth will be on a sound basis, 
the Board urges that the bank's capital position be reviewed on a 
continuing basis. The Board trusts that earnings will be carefully 
retained and that consideration will be given to a realignment of 
the bank's asset structure and further sales of new stock to 
strengthen the bank's capital structure whenever such actions 
seem feasible. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

Secretary.
