P r a c^ice established last autumn,

ederal Reserve Bank whose directors had voted to establish 
per cent discount rate. 
In reaching its decision, the Board considered 
the presently sensitive state of the financial markets -
and concludcd that it would bo desirable not to take 
another tightening action so soon after the most recent 
discount rate increase and at a time when markets

lead to a misreading of the current posture and outlook 
for monetary policy.
