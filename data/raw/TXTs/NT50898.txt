Request for hearing. The Riggs National Bank of Washington, D. C., 
Washington. D. C., had requested that the Board order a hearing to determine 
whether American Security and Trust Company or American Security Corporation, 
b
°th of Washington, I). C., or their shareholders, were in violation of the 
B
ank Holding Company Act by acquiring and retaining control of Fairfax 
County National Bank, Seven Corners, Virginia, without obtaining the Board's 
Prior approval and, if so, whether an order of divestiture would be an 
a
PPropriate remedy. 
The Legal Division, in a memorandum dated March 23, 1972, discussed 
several alternatives it believed were available to the Board in dealing 
W l t
h the request, and recommended that no further investigation into the 
a t t e r
 was warranted.

,(i During discussion a majority of the Board indicated the belief

H
a

the request for a hearing. Consideration then turned to selection of 
a n
 appropriate hearing examiner, and after discussing existing alternatives, 
m a
Jority favored the suggestion that the hearing should be conducted by 
a
 hearing examiner who was not associated with the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board then unanimously approved the request for a hearing,

 was understood that the matter would be considered further after 
s t a

Gentl c-men: 
As requested in your letter of January 19, 1972, the Board 
°f Governors amends its letter of November 17, 1964, which granted 
c
°nsent for your Corporation ("BIFC"), to acquire control of what is 
n o w
 Bankhaus Centjrale Credit A.G. ("BCC"), Hoenchengladbach, Germany, 
S o
 that the relevant portion of subparagraph (1) reads as follows: 
. ., in any manner, which at the time would not be per-
missible to BIFC;" 
k 
# 
You have also requested consent for BCC to engage in the 
l
siness of underwriting securities. The Board's consent to such 
c
tivities is conditioned upon your Corporation's obtaining the prior 
^onscnt of the Board for the continued holding of shares of BCC should 
acquire stock of individual issuers costing in excess of $500,000 
°
r
 ^presenting 25 per cent of the voting shares of any company, ex-
^
G
Pt in the case where the underwriting is covered by firm commitments 
0 m
 subunderwriters or other purchasers. With respect to underwriting 
S C c
urities in which Corporations are prohibited from investing by the 
Provisions of the eighth paragraph of Section 25(a) of the Federal Re-
®
G r
ve Act, the Board's consent is further conditioned on the fact that 
w i n 
acquire such shares only as an underwriter, and dispose of 
s
uch shares within a reasonable time. 
In this connection, shares acquired as an underwriter need 
£
o t
 be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K. 
However, 
e
y are to be reported as a separate class, together with the date of 
j*
Cc
iuisition, on any Call Report of Condition or similar report requested 
the Board.

Xn a further request, you also asked that the reporting re-
quirements of Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K be suspended, insofar as 
they require information other than the name of the issuer, the number 
°f shares acquired or disposed of and the purchase price, with respect 
to portfolio investments in equity securities made by BGC within the 
scope of the general consent contained in 211.8(a), if such securities 
traded on a recognized exchange in Europe. 
The Board does not consider that it would be appropriate to 
grant waivers or suspensions of a general nature to the subsidiary of 
a
 single Corporation. However, in a recent application, the Board 
found that in the case of a foreign subsidiary's stock investments in 
a small portfolio, the reporting requirements would be satisfied by 
t h
e submission of a broker's information sheet, provided it was ac-
companied by a statement that the company whose stock is acquired did 
n
° business in the United States. A comparable submission would be 
satisfactory in the reporting of BCC's stock acquisitions of the type 
•specified. 
Very truly yours,

Item No. 2

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
SAVANNAH BANK & TRUST COMPANY OF SAVANNAH 
Order Approving Application for Acquisition of Assets 
and Assumption of Liabilities under Bank Merger Act 
Savannah Bank & Trust Company of Savannah, Savannah, 
G e o
* g i a ("Savannah Bank"), a member State bank of the Federal 
Reserve System, has applied for the Board's approval pursuant 
t o
 the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)) of the merger of 
that bank with Chatham Savings Bank, Savannah, Georgia ("Chatham 
Bank"), by means of the purchase of assets and assumption of 
A b i l i t i e s of the Chatham Bank. As an incident to the merger, 
t h e
 Present office of Chatham Bank would become a branch of 
H a n n a h Bank. 
As required by the Act, notice of the proposed merger, 
l t l
 form approved by the Board, has been published, and the Board 
h
as requested reports on competitive factors from the Attorney 
G e n e r a
l » the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit 
I n
surance Corporation. 
The Board has considered the application and all com-
m e n t s
 and reports received in the light of the factors set forth 
i n
 the Act, and finds that: 
Savannah Bank, with deposits of approximately $101 
m i l
- H o n , i s the seventh largest banking organization in Georgia, 
h
°lding 1,3 p e r 
c e n t 
0 f total commercial bank deposits in the State.-^ 
| T ^ T ~ b a n k i n g data are as of June 30, 1971, except data concerning 
atham County banking market which are as of June 30, 1970. 

879

Chatham Bank ($3,4 million in deposits) is a small savings institution 
Prohibited from accepting demand deposits under Georgia law. Approval 
o f
 this merger would minimally affect State-wide concentration figures. 
Savannah Bank, 
located 95 feet from Chatham Bank, competes 
directly with that bank for time and savings deposits and real estate 
loans in Chatham County, the relevant geographic market. In Chatham 
Couaty, Savannah Bank is the second largest commercial banking organi-
sation in that market. Savannah Bank holds 15,4 per cent of time and 
savings deposits held by all financial institutions in the relevant 
Market, and Chatham Bank holds 1.2 per cent. After the merger, 
Savannah Bank would continue to rank third in the market for time and 
savings deposits with 16.6 per cent of the market total. In view of 
t h e
 facts of record, the Board concludes that the proposed merger 
Would result in the elimination of some direct competition and that the 
e f
fect on competition would be adverse. However, the Board is required 
t o
 consider whether other aspects of the instant proposal are such that 
a
PProval would be in the public 
interest. 
Chatham Bank, over the past five years, has been experiencing 
a d
ecline in deposits, and its net current earnings have been lower 
t h a
^ the average for similar size Georgia banks. Furthermore, within 
t h e
 past two years Chatham Bank's president and vice president have 
d i e d
; now that financial institution's cnly active officer is approaching 
t e t
irement age. Chatham Bank does not have a stock option plan, profit 
faring plan or retirement system. In view of the above, Chatham Bank 

8S0 
-3-
d
oes not appear capable of attracting the type of individual who 
would be able to stimulate its growth. The likelihood of Chatham 
Bank's converting to a full service commercial bank as other savings 
banks have done is remote as the individuals who own control of this 
b
^nk live over 100 miles from Savannah and the record indicates they 
not interested in such a conversion. Thus, the potential for 
S u
bstantial 
increased competition developing between Savannah Bank 
a n d
 C h a t h a m Bank is not likely. From the record, it appears that 
Savannah Bank is the only financial institution that has shown any 
interest in acquiring Chatham Bank and Savannah Bank's interest 
arisen previously because of the latter institution's ownership 
o f
 real estate near Savannah Bank's main office which it desires 
future expansion purposes. 
In the light of Chatham Bank's serious management succes-
S i
"
0 n
 Problem, there is no assurance that capable management can be 
at
tracted 
to the Bank in the absence of approval of the proposed 
transaction. Consequently, the financial and managerial factors 
l e n d
 substantial weight for approval of this application, and the 
and needs aspects outweigh the adverse competitive 
c
°tisequences of this proposed merger. Based upon the foregoing, 
it * 
l s
 the Board's judgement that consummation of the proposal 
w
°uld be in the public interest and that the application should 
be approved, 

88i 
-4-
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consum-
®ated ( a ) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this 
°^der or (b) later than three months after the date of this Order, 
unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the 
federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors,-^ April 6, 1972.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
BARNETT BANKS OF FLORIDA, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Barnett Banks of Florida, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida, 
a
 bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding 
C o m p a n y Act, has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) 
o f
 the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 90 per cent or more 
o f
 the voting shares of Bank of Florida & Trust Co. at Homestead, 
H o m e s t e a d , Florida ("Bank"). 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
Accordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
a n d
 views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
a l 1
 comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
o f
 the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that:

Acquisition of Bank ($26 million in deposits) by 
applicant would increase its percentage share of deposits by only 
Per c e n t and would leave Applicant as the third ranking banking 
0 r
gani 2 ation in Florida. Consummation of the transaction will not

esult in a significant increase in the concentration of banking 
^sources in Florida.

Bank is located in Dade County, as are two banking subsidiaries 
°f Applicant. However, the closest of those subsidiaries is 26 miles 
from Bank, and there is no substantial existing competition between 
those subsidiaries and Bank; nor, due to the distance involved, the pres-
ence of numerous banking alternatives, and Florida's branching statutes, 
l s
 there substantial likelihood of future competition developing between 
th
°se subsidiaries and Bank. Neither is there any significant possibility 
°f substantial competition developing between any other of Applicant's 
b a
nking subsidiaries and Bank for similar reasons. 
Moreover, consummation of this transaction could have a bene-
ficial effect on competition in the Dade County area. Applicant pres-
e n t
l y controls only 2.1 per cent of deposits in Dade County, and does 
n o t
 rank within the top 10 banking organizations. Acquisition of Bank 
^ u l d increase Applicant's share of Dade County deposits by .8 per 
C e n
t and would give it a service outlet in an area of Dade County in 
^hich it is presently not represented. Acquisition of Bank should 
enable Applicant to provide more effective competition for the much 
l a r
ger banking organizations in Dade County with which it must compete. 
F
°
r
 these reasons, the Board concludes that the competitive factors 
a t e
 consistent with approval of this application. 
Considerations relating to the financial condition, managerial 
resources and prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary banks and Bank 
a t e
 generally satisfactory. However, affiliation with Applicant should 

884

strengthen Bank's management and this consideration lends some weight 
toward approval. Considerations relating to the convenience and needs

Order Approving Acquisition of Banks 
Weerva, Inc., Lakewood, Colorado, a bank holding company

S e
Parately for the Board's approval under 
§ 3(a)(3) of the Act

 the voting shares of the following five banks: (1) First Westland 
National Bank, Lakewood, Colorado ("Lakewood Bank"); (2) The Bank of 
V a

("Longmont Bank"), a proposed new bank. 
Notice of receipt of the applications has been given in

views has expired. The Board has considered the applications 
all comments received in light of the factors set forth in 
§
 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant controls one bank, Wheat Ridge National Bank, 
W h e
a t Ridge, Colorado ("Wheat Ridge Bank"), with deposits of $3.3 
m l
U i o n , representing .1 per cent of the total commercial bank

(deposits of $1.2 million), Minturn Bank (deposits of $.7 million), 

886

and Longmont Bank, a proposed new bank, Applicant would control 
a
PProximately $31 million in deposits, representing ,7 per cent of

Applicant presently directly owns between 20 and 23 per 
C e n t o f
 the voting shares of the four existing banks it seeks to 
C(

&
r

 or nearby markets, they are generally small factors in 
their 
markets and consummation of the proposal would have little 
^Petittve impact. Both Lakewood Bank and Wheat Ridge Bank are 

887 
-3-
the Denver banking market, which is characterized by large holding 
c
°mpanies. Their combined deposits represent only .9 per cent of 
total market deposits. The Erie Bank is located in the Weld County 
a r e
a , and its deposits represent only ,7 per cent of total market 
shares in that area. The Longmont Bank, which is a proposed new bank, 
w
°uld be part of the Boulder County area and would be competing with 
°rganization that has over 40 per cent of total market deposits, 
V a i
l Bank and Minturn Bank are both located in Eagle County with only 
°
ne
 other bank in the area. The Vail Bank has 49 per cent of market 
de 
Posits in this area while the Minturn Bank has 6,9 per cent of the 
d e
Posits. However, due to the different economic characteristics of 
tll
e two communities served and the intervening terrain, there is little 
c
°nipetitive overlap between the two and little is likely to develop. 
Although Applicant will still be a small factor in Colorado 
a
^ter consummation of these acquisitions, it has a potential for 
IJ 
U r
e expansion which would provide additional competition for the 
a r g e
 folding companies in Colorado and is a procompetitive develop-
ment 
T>U 
The Board concludes that competitive considerations are COn-
Sigf-,, , 
ent with approval of each of the applications. 
Considerations relating to the financial condition, mana-
gerial resources, and prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary bank, 
a n d
 the five banks sought to be acquired are generally satisfactory, 
however, upon consummation of the proposal Applicant will raise addi-
t i o t
*al capital funds for Lakewood Bank and Vail Bank, These considera-
tions lend weight toward approval of those applications and are consistent 

888

w
ith approval of the others. Considerations relating to the convenience 
and needs of the communities to be served are consistent with approval 
the applications, particularly since the stronger internal organi-
sation that will result from approval of these applications should 
e n a b l e A p p l i c a n t to facilitate the transfer of personnel among banks 
a
s needed. 
Finally, Applicant shall not retain or acquire any nonbank 
shares or engage in any nonbanking activities to a greater extent or 
f o r
 a longer period than would apply in the case of a bank holding 
company which became such on the date of the proposed consummations, 
except to the extent otherwise permitted in any regulation of the 
Board hereafter adopted specifically relating to the effect of the 
a c
quisition of an additional bank on the status of nonbank shares 
a
 activities of a one-bank holding company formed prior to 1971, 
°
r U n
less the Board fails to adopt any such regulation before the

*Piration of two years after the consummation of the proposed 
a c
quisitions. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the 
P

o p o 8 e d acquioitions would be in the public interest and the appli-
Cations should be approved. 
On the basis of the record the applications are approved 
the reasons summarised above. The transactions shall not be

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FIRST NATIONAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY, INC. 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
First National Bank Holding Company, Inc., Pinedale,

o f
 the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)), for 
tl

8 3

Bank of Pinedale, Pinedale, Wyoming ("Bank"). 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
a c
cordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments

views has expired. The Board has considered the application 
a n d
 all comments received in the light of the factors set forth 
§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant is a nonoperating corporation formed for the 
P u
*pose of acquiring Bank, which has aggregate deposits of approx-
i m
ately $5,6 million. 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1971.) 
Al i 
shareholders of Bank are being accorded substantially equal 
e
atment. Since Applicant has no present operations or subsidiaries, 
it 
u a
ppears 
that consummation of the proposal would not affact existing 
c
 Potential competition, nor have an adverse effect on any other bank 
i t l
 
area. 
The banking considerations are consistent with approval 
application. The financial and managerial resources of Bank 
its prospects are regarded as generally satisfactory. Applicant 

891 
-3-
h a
s not commenced operations; thus, its financial condition, manage-
m e
n t and prospects are dependent upon those of Bank, Applicant's 
Projected earnings appear to be sufficient to service the debt which 
will incur upon consummation of the proposed transaction, without 
Adversely affecting Bank's capital structure. The proposed acquisition 
i s n o t
 likely to have any significant immediate effect on the convenience 
a t l d n

W l t h
 approval of the application. It is the Board's judgment that

Dear Mr. Jamison: 
This refers to your letters dated February 28 and 
March 3, 1972 which enclosed inquiries from Dart Industries Inc. 
(Dart) with regard to its 1971 Stock Option Plan (Plan). Dart 
wishes to make provisions in the credit documents of Plan tor 
the immediate release to the borrowers of the pledged shares 
Dart common stock upon payment to Dart of the entire principal 
and interest. You may wish to make the substance of the following 
reply available to Dart. 
As you know, section 207.4(a)(2) of the Board's 
Regulation G forbids the release of shares pledged to secure 
^edit extended under that section, until certain prescribed 
conditions have been met. For the reasons discussed below, 
the Board regards this restriction as essential to carry out 
the policy objectives of section 207.4(a), that option credit 
extended on a low-margin basis only if the conditions of the 
X
<>an are such that the credit is more likely to be repaid from 
the borrower's own resources, and less likely to be satisfied by 
a sale of the pledged shares. 
In its letter dated March 1, 1972, Dart states: 
"We believe that the lack of any 
provision permitting release of 
securities upon prepayment is extremely 
inequitable and creates a substantial 

833 
® 
Mr. H. B. Jamison 
- 2 -
v
 * v* * " »• 
hardship for the individual debtor. 
We further believe that such a result 
is not consistent with Section 7(d) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934." 
1 . 
: 
It is well within the Board's statutory authority, 
however, to prescribe such conditions for the release of pledged 
collateral. Section 7(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
empowers the Board to prescribe rules and regulations "to prevent 
the excessive use of credit for the purchasing or carrying of 
°r trading in securities" and makes it unlawful for persons 
subject to such regulations "to extend or maintain credit . . . 
f
or the purpose of purchasing or carrying any security, in con-
travention of their terms." Regulation G was adopted pursuant 
to this statutory mandate. If it were not for an exemption 
carved in the Regulation, credit to exercise options to purchase 
^ r g i n stock - such as stock of Dart - could not be extended in 
excess of the maximum loan value provided in the Supplement to 
Regulation G. 
In view of the underlying policy stated above, and to 
make it less likely that optionees will have to sell the stock 
t o
 Pay for the purchase - an event which would tend to be destabilizing 
to the securities markets - the exemption provides that to be 
e l
igible, a plan for option credit must contain the following 
restrictions: 
1. The borrower must make installment payments 
(a) at least quarterly, 
(b) for at least three years from the extension 
of the credit, 
(c) 
in an amount per annum at least equal to 
20 per cent of the "deficiency" - the amount • 
by which the credit exceeds the normal loan 
value (section 207.4(a)(2)(ii)). 
2. The borrower must not be allowed access (except in 
emergency situations) to the stock until, 
(a) all repayments have been made for the three 
year period and the deficiency has been repaid, 
or 
(b) as a result of the repayments described and/or 
an increase in the market value of the collateral, 
the credit still owing no longer exceeds the 
amount normally permitted to be lent (section 
207.4(a)(2)(iii)). 

894 
M r
. H. B. Jamison 
- 3 -
Accordingly, the prepayment provision contemplated 
In Dart's Plan would render Plan ineligible for the exemption 
in section 207.4(a). It should be noted further that the only 
Provision in the section in which the Board has retained power 
t o
 permit modification is that concerning a lower pay-down 
'Provision. 
Incidentally, while the letters submitted by Dart 
describe only a part of the remainder of Plan, a reference appears 
to "yearly" payments over a five year deferred payment period. 
You may wish to call Dart's attention to the requirement that 
calls for "equal repayments . . . at least quarterly." 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

STATEMENT BY 
BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
REGARDING APPLICATION BY 
MIDLANTIC BANKS INC,, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, 
FOR APPROVAL OF ACQUISITION OF BANK 
Nature of transaction. - Midlantic Banks Inc., Newark, 
New jpyo 
e
y» a registered bank holding company, has applied to the 
B
°
a r d o f
 Governors, pursuant to § 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company 
A c t
 (12 U.S.C, 1842(a)(3)), for priar approval of the acquisition of 
1 0 0
 Per cent (less directors' qualifying shares) of the voting shares 
Of 
e successor by merger to Citizens National Bank, Englewood, New 
Jersey ("citizens Bank"). 
The Board in an Order and Statement dated July 29, 1971, 
n i p
d an earlier application by Applicant to acquire Citizens Bank. 
Pl
*licant subsequently filed a request for reconsideration and also an 
t e
*native proposal providing for the removal of the home office of 
^it i 
Z f c t l s B a n
k from Englewood, New Jersey, to Tenafly, New Jersey, 
h l C h a l r
e a d y had home office protection. In an Order dated October 19, 
1971 t-u 
»
 c
ne Board denied Applicant's request for reconsideration of its 
^ e r 
a 
, sated July 29, 1971, and directed that Applicant's alternative 
be processed as a new application. 
.Statutory considerations. - Applicant controls six banks with 
l e g a t e deposits of $687 million and is the fourth largest banking 
Sanitation in Kew Jersey with 5.0 per cent of deposits in the State.-^ 
d f l
ta arT7s of June 30, 1970, and reflect holding company 
ions and acquittitions approved by the Board to date. 
837 
\ 

838 
-2-
The acquisition of Bank (deposits of $194 million) would make Applicant 
the largest banking organization in New Jersey, but its share of 
deposits in the State would be only approximately 6.3 per cent. 
Applicant presently has four subsidiaries in the First Banking 
District of New Jersey: National Newark and Essex Bank ("National Newark"), 
a $602 million institution, which is the fourth largest commercial bank 
in the State; The Sussex and Merchants National Bank of Newton (deposits 
°f $46 million), which is the largest of four relatively small banks 
in Sussex County; Madison National Bank, Madison (deposits of $9 million), 
which is the twenty-eighth largest of 46 banks in the Greater Newark 
Market; and Midlantic National Bank, Parsippany-Troy Hills, a new bank. 
The other two subsidiaries of Applicant are small banks located in the 
Second and Third Banking Districts. 
National Newark is the third largest of 34 banking organizations 
in the Greater Newark Market, with 17.3 per cent of the total deposits in 
2/ 
that market. 
Citizens Bank, located in Bergen County in the First 
district, is the fifth largest of 39 banking organizations in the Paterson 
3/ 
Market, with 6.2 per cent of deposits in the market. 
In connection with the review of the application, the Board 
has considered a comment from the Department of Justice, which concluded 
that consummation of the alternative proposal "would have an adverse 
effect on competition." The Department stated that the amended proposal 
^ 
_ 
z./ The Greater Newark Market includes all of Essex County and parts of 
Union, Hudson and Morris Counties. 
1/ Bergen and Passaic Counties constitute the Paterson Market. 

899

(as would have the original) would eliminate Applicant as a potential, 
de novo entrant or as an entrant through purchase of a small or "foot-
hold" bank into Bergen County, and also would eliminate Citizens Bank 
9 3 a
 potential member of a new holding company system in New Jersey. 
Department additionally expressed concern that the acquisition of 
C i t
izens Bank would serve to trigger other acquisitions which would re-
S u
*t in a consolidation of commercial banking in the North Jersey Area 
i n
 a few institutions. The Department acknowledged that the removal of 
t h e
 home office of Citizens Bank from Englewood to Tenafly would elim-
i n
ate home office protection in Englewood, However, the Department 
8 t
ated that this might only be a temporary benefit, since a new bank 
c
°
u
ld be chartered in Englewood which would restore home office protec-
t i o n
 to that city. 
There is no present competition existing between any of 
applicant's five smaller subsidiaries, two of which are not located in 
th 
6
 First Banking District, and Citizens Bank and, based on the facts 
Of 
record, substantial competition is unlikely to develop in the future, 
Summation of the acquisition would not eliminate substantial present 
^ P e t i t i o n 
between Citizens Bank and Applicant's largest subsidiary, 
^
a t
ional Newark, Despite the fact that these institutions are in adjoin-
markets and their closest offices are 12 miles apart, the record 
c
ates there is little deposit or loan overlap Jsetween them. 

-4-
Moreover, any possible lessening of potential competition 
vould be offset by the far larger pro-competitive benefits that would 
result from the approval of the application. The New Jersey banking 
market is one of the richest in the nation; gauged by per capita income 
Payments, New Jersey ranks third among the industrial States of the nation 
after Connecticut and New York. Yet New Jersey's share of the U.S. bank 
deposit market lags well behind its proportion of U.S. population and 
Personal income: 3.13 per cent compared to 3.51 per cent and 4.14 per 
cent respectively. 
The reasons for an underdeveloped New Jersey banking system 
are not obscure. On the one hand, the State's banks have been exposed 
^ vigorous competition from banks in two of the nation's major financial 
centers, New York and Philadelphia. On the other hand, the structure 
°f New Jersey banking itself has been truncated at the top and bottom 
b
y constraints placed on normal growth of the larger banks and by the 
i n h i b i t o r y 
policy a g a i n s t entrance implicit in home office protec-
tion statutes and a conservative chartering policy. The resulting 
hanking structure is far less vigorous and competitive than found in 
the New York and Philadelphia market alternatives. 
Over 75 per cent of all New Jersey residents live in the New 
^ork-Northeastern New Jersey and Philadelphia urbanized areas. 
Large 
A m b e r s of these residents find that banking services near work are more 
c
°nvenient and encompass a broader range of banking conveniences than are 
available where they live, hence they bank in New York and Philadelphia. 

901 
-3-
Large businesses located in New Jersey would be expected to 
c r
oss the rivers for adequate banking accommodation, but many moderate 
sized business customers have been forced away from a natural reliance 
°
n l o
cal sources of bank credit and the measure of solicitude which goes 
W i t h
 local accommodation because local institutions have not grown to 
a
 size commensurate with the needs of even a medium sized business. 
The principal competition for the banking business of medium 
sized firms in New Jersey comes from banks in Philadelphia and New York. 
A f
t e r this acquisition is consummated, New Jersey's largest banking 
will be less than half the size of the largest Philadelphia 
b a n k 
a
^d smaller even than Philadelphia's fourth largest bank. The size 
disparity between New Jersey banking organizations and those operating 
l n
 New York City is much more pronounced. New Jersey's largest banking 
O r
ganization 
will be only one-fifteenth as large as the largest organi-
2
ati 0 n operating in New York City and about equal in size to the thir-
t e e
nth largest operating there. 
The transformation that has been taking place in the banking 
s t r
ucture of New York, Virginia, Florida, and other States seems to 
heen a precedent for an attempted revitalization of the New Jersey 
structure implicit in recent legislative action. Expanded 
Ranching opportunities are now available and State-wide holding 
S a n i e s have been authorized. Under the interim and subsequent 
ste 
in: 
P
a
 to be taken, it is now becoming possible for the New Jersey bank-
8 structure to respond to entrepreneurial energy and innovation and 
P
*°
v
ide New Jersey with a genuinely indigenous, locally rooted banking 
8
*>tem, 

902 
-3-
Affiliation with Applicant will enable Citizens Bank to 
service those New Jersey businesses who presently must look outside the 
State for their banking needs and also the large number of institutions 
a n
d businesses that are moving or contemplating moving to northern New 
Jersey and which require services that a bank the size of Citizens Bank 
would find difficult to provide. Otherwise, Citizens Bank will remain 
a
 fairly passive competitive factor in the New York-Northeastern New 
Jersey and Philadelphia areas. Moreover, several new bank holding 
companies have been formed in New Jersey since consideration was given 
t o
 the earlier application. There is no longer the same basis for the 
a
PPrehension that only a small number of bank holding companies will 
d
°minate the State. 
There is another aspect of a pro-competitive nature that will 
result from the approval of this application. 
The original proposal 
b
V A p p H c a n t : would have preserved home office protection in Englewood, 
a
 definitely anticompetitive consideration. 
However, Applicant now 
Proposes to remove the home office of Citizens Bank from Englewood to 
^enafly, New Jersey, if its application is approved. 
This would have 
t h
e pro-competitive effect of opening Englewood to branching from 
Without 
and would not raise new barriers in Tenafly, since the latter 
c
ity already has home office protection due to another bank's home 
o f
fice being located there. 
Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
0 f
 Applicant's proposal would not result in a monopoly or be in 

903 
-3-
furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize 
the business of banking in any area. Moreover, the competitive effects 
the proposal are consistent with approval of the application and, 
1ft fact, lend some weight toward approval. 
The financial condition of Applicant, its subsidiary banks, 
and of Citizens Bank is generally satisfactory and prospects of all are 
f a
vorable. Citizens Bank has had a capital problem but Applicant has 
Iftdicated this will be resolved if the application is approved. These 
c
°nsiderations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Consummation of Applicant's proposal would have a beneficial 
e
ffect on the convenience and needs of Englewood banking customers 
si
ftce it would dissolve Citizens Bank's home office protection under 
Jersey law and open that city to branching from without. While 
n o
 additional types of banking services would be introduced into 
t h e
 Paterson Market as a result of the proposed affiliation with 
Applicant. an additional competitive alternative for larger customers 
^ i d be provided. Considerations relating to this factor lend weight 
approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
c
°fttained in the record and in the light of the factors set forth in 
*
 3
(
c
) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed trans-
ition is in the public interest and that the application should be 
Approved.

DISSENlING STATEMENT bF 
GOVERNORS ROBERTSON, MAlSEi A^t) BRIMMSR 
We dissent from the majority's a^piroval of the acquisition 
o f
 a' bank of almost $200 million 
deposits by the fourth largest bank-
organization in New Jersey, which is headquartered in the same 
inking district as the bank to be acquired. 
Although there Is little existing competition between the 
S u
M d i a r i e s of Applicant and Citizens Bank, consummation of the trans-
ition would have a serious adverse effect on potential competition. 
Applicant's lead bank, National Newark, is the fourth largest commercial 
in the State and is headquartered in the Greater Newark Market, 
^hich adjoins the Paterson Market in which Citizens Bank operates. 
Th 
e r
® can be little doubt that National Newark is one of the most 
potential entrants into the Paterson Market both from terms 
o f
 Interest and capabilities. This interest coultf manifest itself 
e l t
h e r through de novo entry or by the acquisition of a bank smaller 
^ a n Citizens Bank, which ranks fifth of 39 banking organizations in 
t h e
 Paterson Market. 
These considerations weigh heavily for us and are not offset 
y
 the problematical benefits of providing stronger competition for 
N e w
 York City and Philadelphia banks. Admittedly, there may he some 
e n
efit to a few larger customers in the Paterson Market from having 
Presence of Applicant in that market manifest itself through a 
la 
bank already in the market. However, for the great majority 
' < 
the 
Of C u
stomers, this increased size will have little meaning. 
Instead, 
r e
s u l t of the acquisition will be that they will have a potential 

905 
-3-
a
lternative source of services for their banking needs eliminated . 
consummation of the acquisition. The Supreme Court said in the Phillips-
1/ 
burg case 
that all classes of customers must be taken into account, 
a
nd that benefits to some customers should not be allowed to override 
more significant detriment to other customers. 
Furthermore, in our view, it is doubtful that this acquisition 
place Midlantic in a position to compete in any meaningful way with 
New Y o r k City and Philadelphia banks. The size disparity will still be 
great. 
The Majority Statement declares that the structure of New 
J e
rsey banking is "truncated" at the top. This "truncated" structure will 
n
<>t c o n t i n u e for long if the Board continues to permit large holding 
companies, the size of Applicant, to freely acquire banks the size

 Citizens, with almost $200 million in deposits, even when located 
i t l
 the same banking district as the holding company's lead bank. 
The Majority Statement also mentions that there is now a 
l a
rger number of bank holding companies than existed last July when the 
Previous application by this Applicant was denied. Of course, the four 
l a
rgest bank holding companies are still the same as were in existence 
a t
 the time of our earlier consideration and all headquartered in the 
F l
rst Banking District of New Jersey.

We believe the public interest would be better served and 
the desired goal of improved competition advanced if a bank holding 
comp a ny headquartered in either the Second or Third New Jersey Banking 
district were to acquire Citizens Bank, and through that means make its 
Presence felt in the First Banking District. 
There are at present only eight independent banks in the First 
inking District with total deposits between $100 and $300 million. If 
a n y
 
these banks are to be acquired by a holding company, it should 
by 
a company located in another banking district; that would be 
Ue
cessary to provide meaningful competition to the four large holding 
c
°Qipanies headquartered in the First District. Another alternative that 
v
°
u
ld be preferable to approval of this application would be the corn-
n a t i o n of certain of these banks in a new holding company which would 
able to exert competitive pressure on the existing holding companies. 
Ei t h 
a e
r of these possible courses of action would enhance competition, 
n o t
 lessen it as would consummation of this transaction. 
The M a j o r i t y S t a t e m e n t mentions as a procompetitive factor 
consummation of the transaction as now proposed would remove home 
ce protection from Englewood and make it possible for other banks to 
competing branch©* in Englewood. Thie element of the present 
HP. 
P°sal - indeed, the only new element - is not entitled to much weight 
determining whether there are enough public benefits flowing from the 
t t a 
ansaction to outweigh the adverse competitive factor because home 
°
ff
ice protection can be reinstated simply by the chartering of a new 

-4-
bank there. What is more, temporary elimination of home office 
Protection in Englewood may serve to strengthen and prolong the home 
o f
fice protection in Tenafly. 
Having reconsidered this application, we remain convinced that 
c
°n8ummation of the transaction would have a serious adverse effect on 
competition which is not outweighed by any public benefits flowing from 
the transaction. As a matter of fact, we see no public benefits what-
soever flowing to the vast majority of Citizens' customers. We would 
der
*y the application.

D
ear Mr. Baker: 
The Board's General Counsel informed you by letter of 
anuary 7, 1972, that the Board had received a request for a pro-
ceeding under the Bank Holding Company Act to determine whether 
m
erican Security and Trust Company or American Security Corporation, 
0 r
 their shareholders, had violated provisions of the Act by 
a c
quiring and retaining control of Fairfax County National Bank 
without obtaining the Board's approval and, if so, whether an 
0 r
der of divestiture would be an appropriate remedy. 
The Board has considered the request and the information 
submitted by letter of January 17, 1972, in response to 
X n
quiries by the staff. The Board has decided that a hearing on the 
m a
tter would be in the public interest. The date of the hearing 
and details concerning it will be settled as soon as practicable. 
0 1 1
 will be advised further in this regard. 
The Board appreciates the cooperation you have shown 
i n
 this matter.

Very truly yours,
