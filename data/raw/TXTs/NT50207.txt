Reserves against Federal Reserve notes. There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum from Mr. Holland dated January 16, 1968, to 

1^3 
1/19/68 
-2-
which was attached a memorandum developed by the Board's staff review-
ing a variety of legal, operational, and administrative problems that 
might arise from the statutory requirement of a 25 per cent gold 
reserve against Federal Reserve note liabilities if Federal Reserve 
gold certificate holdings became inadequate for the purpose. The 
staff memorandum (a copy of which has been placed in the Board's 
files) proposed a number of actions to improve relevant operating 
Procedures and ameliorate possible adverse effects. It was suggested 
in Mr. Holland's memorandum that the Board consider the documentation 
°n a preliminary basis, refer it to the Federal Reserve Banks for 
comments, and then reach final determinations. 
The discussion at today's meeting reflected general agreement 
that the staff recommendations should be regarded as in the nature of 
i 
contingency planning against conditions that would not come to pass 
if, as was to be hoped, the Congress took action soon to repeal the 
gold cover requirements of the law. Some reservations were expressed 
about going any further at this time than to set the documentation 
aside for study and consideration if and when a more immediate need 
developed. These reservations were based essentially on the ground 
that disclosure of any actions, or plans, to modify existing proce-
dures could, under existing circumstances, have unfortunate repercus-
sions both domestically and internationally. However, an opinion also 
was expressed that it would seem imprudent not to take all reasonable 

J 
1/19/68 
-3-
steps to have plans in readiness for implementation promptly if neces-
sary, which suggested obtaining the views of the Federal Reserve Bank 
Presidents on a confidential basis. The question of the procedure 
that should be followed was held temporarily in abeyance. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland and Kenyon 
then withdrew from the meeting. Messrs. Hatch, Chairman, and Kimbrel, 
First Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, entered. 
Appointments at Atlanta Bank (Item No. 1)• The Board's Com-
mittee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans (Governors 
Mitchell, Maisel, and Brimmer) had met on previous occasions with Mr. 
Kimbrel for discussion of the appointment of a First Vice President 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta if Mr. Kimbrel succeeded to the 
presidency following President Patterson's retirement at the end of 
this month. The Board's Committee had furnished Mr. Kimbrel a list 
°f names of persons outside the Atlanta Bank who might be considered, 
and the purpose of today's meeting was to explore the matter further. 
At the invitation of the Board, Mr. Kimbrel made a statement 
in which he advised that the names supplied by the Board's Committee 
had been given careful consideration. Nevertheless, although the list 
included persons who would appear well equipped to handle the position 
°f First Vice President satisfactorily, he remained of the opinion that 
it would be preferable for the appointment to be made from within the 
ranks of the Bank. Specifically, he believed that Robert E. Moody, Jr. 

138 
1/19/68 
-4-
currently Vice President and Manager of the Nashville Branch, would be 
the best candidate in view of Mr. Moody's demonstrated administrative 
capability and the contribution that he would be in a position to make 
in supervising the operations of the Bank for the next several years 
until he reached retirement age. It was Mr. Kimbrel's view that the 
appointment of Mr. Moody would have a most salutary effect on morale 
within the Bank. He also described a group of younger officers of 
strong potential and expressed the belief that candidates to succeed 
Mr. Moody in the position of First Vice President, and to hold other 
high posts, might well emerge from that group. 
Chairman Hatch then made a statement in which he expressed 
general agreement with the views of Mr. Kimbrel. 
Governor Mitchell, as Chairman of the Board's Committee, empha 
sized the concern felt by the Committee that strong leadership should 
be provided at the Atlanta Reserve Bank, and the other members of the 
Committee commented in similar vein. 
Messrs. Hatch and Kimbrel indicated that they appreciated the 
Committee's concern and expressed their concurrence with the objective 
sought. It was their view that the objective could be attained most 
satisfactorily through the appointment of Mr. Moody, who would serve 
as First Vice President during a period that might be described as one 
of transition.

Chairman Martin noted that the Board was in receipt of a 
telegram advising that the directors of the Atlanta Bank at a meeting 
°n January 12 had, subject to the approval of the Board of Governors, 
appointed Mr. Kimbrel as President of the Bank effective February 1, 
1968, with salary at the annual rate of $40,000 for the period 
February 1 through December 31, 1968. Chairman Martin observed that 
a starting salary at the rate of $37,500 would appear more appropriate, 
Particularly in comparison with the salaries of other Reserve Bank 
Presidents. Chairman Hatch replied that the question of salary had 
since been resolved by the directors in favor of the rate to which 
Chairman Martin referred. 
Chairman Hatch and Mr. Kimbrel then withdrew from the meeting 
and the Board gave further consideration to the situation at the 
Atlanta Bank. 
Governors Mitchell, Maisel, and Brimmer reviewed the need for 
strong leadership at the Bank and indicated that they continued to 
have some reservations as to whether that level of leadership would 
be provided. 
Chairman Martin said that he shared the Committee's concern 
about the objective of assuring strong leadership. He believed that 
the Board's thinking had been made fully apparent, both through the 
meetings of the Board's Committee with Mr. Kimbrel and at today's 
feting with Chairman Hatch and Mr. Kimbrel. That having been done, 

J 
1/19/68 
-6-
and with Chairman Hatch and Mr. Kimbrel having expressed to the Board 
their opinion as to how the problem could best be met and the desired 
objective attained, it was his belief that approval of the appoint-
ments of Messrs. Kimbrel and Moody would be appropriate. 
Governors Daane, Sherrill, and Robertson expressed views simi-
lar to those stated by Chairman Martin. Governors Mitchell, Maisel, 
and Brimmer indicated that they would not want to be recorded as oppos-
ing approval of the appointments, if it were understood that the reser-
vations they had expressed would be a matter of record. 
Accordingly, the appointment of Mr. Kimbrel as President of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta effective February 1, 1968, for the 
unexpired portion of the five-year term ending February 28, 1971, was 
approved unanimously, along with the payment of salary to Mr. Kimbrel 
as President at the rate of $37,500 for the period February 1 through 
December 31, 1968, if such rate should be fixed by the Board of Direc-
tors . 
Unanimous approval also was given to the appointment of 
Robert E. Moody, Jr., as First Vice President of the Atlanta Reserve 
Bank effective February 1, 1968, for the unexpired portion of the 
five-year term ending February 28, 1971, with salary at the rate of 
$27,500 for the period February 1 through December 31, 1968, subject 
to appropriate action being taken by the Board of Directors to make 
the appointment and fix the salary at the indicated rate.

Attached as Item No. 1 is a copy of the letter sent to Chairman 
Hatch following today's meeting. 
Discount rates. The establishment without change by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Boston on January 15 and by the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco on 
January 18, 1968, of the rates on discounts and advances in their 
existing schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that appropriate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
Extension of direct purchase authority. It was stated that 
the Bureau of the Budget had requested the views of the Board with 
respect to proposed legislation that would extend for an additional 
two years from June 30, 1968, the authority of the Federal Reserve 
Banks to purchase U.S. obligations directly from the Treasury. 
It was agreed that the Budget Bureau should be advised by 
telephone that the Board endorsed such legislation. 
Reserves against Federal Reserve notes (Item No. 2). Members 
of the Board noted that the discussion earlier at today's meeting had 
indicated that no strong objection would be seen to obtaining the con-
fidential views of the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents on most of the 
staff recommendations contained in the memorandum dealing with problems 
that might arise with respect to gold reserve requirements against 
Federal Reserve notes. The exceptions were with regard to three rec-
ommendations: 
(1) that the term "notes in actual circulation" be 

1/19/68 
-8-
redefined to exclude all notes in the hands of any Reserve Bank; (2) 
that no change be made in the long-standing conclusion that, in the 
event of a deficiency in the reserve against notes, a tax and an 
increase in the discount rate were mandatory whether or not the Board 
suspended reserve requirements; and (3) that the Board reject the pos-
sibility of reducing the basic discount rate for the purpose of off-
setting an addition required by a reserve deficiency. 
It was agreed that those recommendations and the related 
material should be deleted from the version of the staff memorandum 
that would be sent to the Presidents requesting their comments and 
suggestions. It was also agreed that the tone of the recommendation 
that further consideration be given to an arrangement under which all 
Interdistrict Settlement Fund transactions would be settled through 
security holdings should be made more positive. It was further agreed 
that, because of the sensitivity of the subject matter, the Presidents 
°f the Reserve Banks should be asked to treat the documentation in the 
strictest confidence. 
Attached as Item No. 2 is a copy of the letter subsequently 
Sent to the Reserve Bank Presidents. 
Dinner for Federal Advisory Council. The Board authorized 
Payment of the cost of a dinner to be given at the Board's building 
°n Monday, February 19, 1968, for the members of the Federal Advisory 
Council. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Sir: 
Enclosed is a memorandum dated January 23, 1968, that has 
been developed by the Board's staff reviewing the variety of legal, 
operational, and administrative problems that may arise from the 
statutory requirement of a 25 per cent gold reserve against Federal 
Reserve notes, if that statute is not repealed and Federal Reserve 
gold certificate holdings become inadequate. As you will note, the 
memorandum proposes a number of actions that might be taken to im-
prove relevant operating procedures and ameliorate possible adverse 
effects. 
The Board has considered this memorandum on a preliminary 
basis and would like to have the benefit of the comments and 
suggestions of the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks before 
Proceeding further. Because of the timeliness of this question, the 
Board would appreciate receiving any comments promptly. In addition, 
because of the sensitivity of the subject matter, it is suggested 
that you treat this document in the strictest confidence. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.

Gentlemen: 
The Director of the Division of Examinations, on behalf 
of the Board of Governors under delegated authority, approves the 
establishment of a branch by United California Bank, Los Angeles, 
California, in the vicinity of the intersection of Travis Boulevard 
and Pennsylvania Avenue, Fairfield, California, provided the branch 
is established within one year from the date of this letter. 
In considering this application it has been determined 
that your bank's management is satisfactory, that the proposed branch 
will serve the convenience and needs of the community, and that 
establishment of the branch will not tend to create an undesirable 
competitive situation. Preliminary figures from the most recent 
report of examination of your bank by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco indicate consideration should be given to all means 
to strengthen your bank's capital position. 
Very truly yours,
