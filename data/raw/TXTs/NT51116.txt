Publication for comment of a proposed regulation to limit activities 
o f former Board members and employees. This subject had been considered 
most recently by the Board at its meeting on September 14, 1973; the 
current proposal incorporated revisions suggested at that meeting. 
Today's discussion included clarification of several provisions 
and developed agreement on certain changes in wording, after which the 
Board unanimously approved publication of the proposed regulation for 
comment. A copy of the proposed regulation, in the form published in 
the Federal Register, is attached as Item No. 5. 
Mr. Engstrom then withdrew. 
Emergency credit assistance to savings and loan industry. At its 
meeting on September 6, 1973, the Board approved, in principle, plans 
f° r Providing emergency credit assistance to the savings and loan industry 
a n d t o other depositary institutions. The Board did not, however, 
rnune that unusual and exigent circumstances then existed warranting 
activation of the plan under the third paragraph of section 13 of the 
Fed 
e ral Reserve Act and authorization to the Federal Reserve Banks to 
make 10 
J-oans m accordance with such plan. 
At today's meeting, the Board reviewed the current situation and 
the Potential needs of the thrift industry for emergency credit assistance. 
It 
W a s n°ted that an affirmative vote of five Board members would be needed 
inaofn v 
i 
icir as the authority in paragraph 3 of section 13 of the Federal 
Reserve a 
v e Act would be used, to activate the emergency credit plan and that

five members of the Board might not be available again on the Board's 
Premises for this purpose until October 1, 1973. 
After discussion, the Board concluded that it would not be 
desirable to activate the emergency credit plan today; however, it 
W a s understood that if circumstances required that the plan be activated 
by the Board prior to October 1, arrangements would be made, if neces-
Sary to meet the voting requirements of paragraph 3 of section 13 of 
the Federal Reserve Act, to have absent Board members participate in 
the vote on this matter, preferably by means of a telephone conference 
lri which each participant would hear and be heard by each other parti-
cipant. 
it was recognized that these arrangements represented a 
departure from customary Board procedures, but it was agreed that such 
arrangements were warranted under current circumstances. 
It was further understood that the Federal Reserve Bank 
Presidents would be encouraged to hold informal discussions as soon as 
Possible with their counterparts at the Federal Home Loan Banks with 
a view to insuring prompt implementation of the emergency credit plan 
l n the event of its activation by the Board. 
It was also understood 
that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents would confer, as appropriate, 
W lth representatives of mutual savings banks and other savings insti-
tutions in this regard. 
Request to nonmember banks concerning increased marginal 
xn a memorandum of September 17 , 1973, Mr. Melnicoff submitted 

«"> f— 
9/18/73 
-5-
draft letters to be sent to nonmember commercial banks and foreign-
owned banking institutions to request their voluntary compliance 
with the Board's marginal reserve program for member banks. 
After discussion, the Board unanimously approved letters, 
w ith changes in wording, to be sent to: 
(1) nonmember banks 
v°luntarily maintaining marginal reserves pursuant to the Board's 
request of May 16, 1973, (2) nonmember banks previously unwilling 
t o maintain marginal reserves, and (3) foreign-owned banking institu-
tions voluntarily maintaining marginal reserves. Samples of these 
Otters are attached as Items 6, 7, and 8, respectively. 
In addition, 
attached as Items 9 and 10, respectively, are samples of the letters 
S e nt to State bank supervisors and to nonmember banks that previously 
had been willing to maintain marginal reserves but had had insufficient 
^abilities 0f the types covered. 
The following persons then entered the room: 
Mr. Lawrence, Associate Adviser, Division of Research and 
Statistics 
Mr. Wiles, Assistant Director, Division of Supervision and 
Regulation 
Other supporting staff 
Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. Pursuant to the Board's 
l o n on August 31, 1973, to reconsider its denial, on June 25, 1973,

submitted memoranda dated September 11, 1973, and September 12, 1973, 
respectively, recommending approval of the application. Additional 
documentation included a memorandum of September 11, 1973, from the 
division of Research and Statistics containing a summary of consultants' 
views on mortgage banking cases. 
In today's discussion, the staff reviewed the case, commenting 
Particularly on new evidence in support of applicant's contentions of 
Public benefits that had not been before the Board in June. 
In this 
connection, it was noted that U. S. Industries, which presently owns 
Gi t- * 
C1zens Mortgage Corporation, has not been a source of needed capital 
f o r the latter organization, and that applicant had agreed to provide 
S U c h capital. Therefore, the staff concluded that approval of the 
current application would result in public benefits through the improved 
competitive position of Citizens Mortgage Corporation. 
On the bas is of the new evidence presented, the Board unanimously 
the application. 
It was understood that documentation to 
lmPlement this decision would be prepared for the Board's considera-
In this regard, Governor Bucher indicated his intention to issue 
a concurring statement. 
First International Bancshares.

Texas. 
Other documentation—bearing on the pattern of expansion by 
the 
e appli c a n t, as well as by other bank holding companies in Texas— 
included memoranda of September 12, 1973, from the Legal Division and 
o f September 18, 1973, from the Divisions of Research and Statistics and 
o f Supervision and Regulation. 
In today's discussion, the Board expressed concern about the 
aPParent trend of the applicant to acquire a major bank in each market 
a r e a i n t o which it has expanded. 
Discussion indicated some sentiment to 
d e n y t h e application in light of this trend, although it was recognized 
that under the particular circumstances of the case it would be difficult 
to rl 
develop a rationale for denial. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Board approved the 
PPlication, Governor Bucher dissenting. 
It was understood that documen-
tati

c°nsideration. 
The meeting then adjourned.

FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First Tennessee National Corporation, Memphis, Tennessee, a bank 
h°lding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
aPPlied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
to acquire all of the voting shares of the successor by 
erger t o t h e J a c k s o n S t a t e B a n k > j a c k s o n > Tennessee ("Bank"). The bank 
t o which Bank is to be merged has no significance except as a means to 
a c lHtate the acquisition of the voting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the 
°Posed acquisition of shares of the successor organization is treated 
herein 
n as the proposed acquisition of the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
8° n s t o submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) o f 
1 t h e Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
and the 
Board has considered the application and all comments received in 
8 h t of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls eight banks with aggregate deposits of 
°*itnately $1.2 billion, representing 11.5 per cent of the total com-
^tciai i , 
t>ank deposits in the State, and is the largest banking organization 
Tenn essee. 
(Banking data are as of December 31, 1972, adjusted to 
t e U e c t h 
"oiding company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board 
t^ou Kh v* 
way 31, 1973.) The acquisition of Bank ($15 million in deposits) 
V°Uld , 
urease Applicant's share of the total State deposits by only 0.1 
P e t cent 
» and would not result in any significant increase in the concen-
o f banking resources in Tennessee. 

3631 
-2-
Bank, the smallest of four banks in the relevant market (approxi-
ted by Madison County), holds 8.6 per cent of total market deposits. The 
^ r G e largest banks each control approximately 36, 29 and 26 per cent, re-
Psctively. The Board concludes that acquisition of Bank would not have 
gnificantly adverse effects on any competing bank. 
Applicant's banking subsidiary nearest to Bank is appro:dmately 
m i l e s away. The distances between Bank and Applicant's subsidiaries pre-
clude o-i 
significant present competition between them. Furthermore, due to the 
8tances involved and Tennessee's restrictive branching laws, there is little 
bability of substantial future competition developing between any of 
Appj^ 
^ 
cant's subsidiaries and Bank. The Board concludes that competitive 
factors n, 
are consistent with approval. 
Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources 
a n d future 
facto 
>»y 
prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary banks, and Bank are satis-
r y anci consistent with approval of the application. There is no evi-
tllat basic banking needs of the area are currently not being satisfied 
^sting banks. Applicant proposes to make available to Bank the services 
its 
b, 
specialized personnel in the fields of mortgage lending, international 
ankine 
and accounts receivable financing. Considerations relating to the 
n c e and needs of the community to be served are consistent with 
apptoval 
the application. It is the Board's judgment that consummation 

3632 
-3~ 
of ^ 
e Proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and that 
thg aPPlication should be approved.1/ 
Applicant controls two nonbanking subsidiaries, Norlen Life 
Urance Company, Phoenix, Arizona, and Investors Mortgage Service, Inc., 
^mphio m 
> Tennessee, which were acquired on October 21, 1969, and on 
a r y 17» 1969, respectively. Norlen Life Insurance Company reinsures

diaries, Griffen Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker acquired on

a C q U l r e d on January 8, 1970. 
In approving this application, the Board finds that the coni-
zation of an additional subsidiary bank with Applicant's existing 
banking subsidiaries is unlikely to have an adverse effect upon the 
Publ^c -i 
interest at the present time. However, Applicant's banking and 
activities remain subject to Board review and the Board 
s the authority to require Applicant to modify or terminate its 
n°nbankin 6 activities or holdings if the Board at any time determines 
t h a t the 
combination of Applicant's banking and nonbanking activities is 
likeiy t n , nave adverse effects on the public interest.

LANDMARK BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA 
Order Approving Acquisition of Banks and Acquisition 
of Mortgage Banking Business 
Landmark Banking Corporation of Florida, Fort Lauderdale, 
l 0 r i d a (formerly Consolidated Bankshares of Florida, Inc.), a bank 
h o l d w 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
a pPUed f o r t h e B o a r d » s approval under §§ 3(a)(3) and 4(c)(8) of the 
flO TT o 
u.S.C. 1842(a)(3) and 1843(c)(8)) to acquire 80 per cent or more 
of 
e voting shares of North American Mortgage Corporation, St. Petersburg, 
a ( North American"), a registered bank holding company, and 
acquire as an incident thereto 98 per cent of the voting shares of The 
cat* Bank, St. Petersburg, Florida, and 87 per cent of the voting 
s W e s °t American National Bank of Clearwater, Clearwater, Florida. 
^Ppli 
C a n t would also acquire the mortgage banking business of North 
an» an activity that has been determined by the Board to be closely 
l a t e d t o banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(1)). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§§ 3 arid 4 of the Act (38 Federal Register 10675 and 23437). The time 
f o t 
H u 
A;LI*g comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered 
the a 
^Plication and all comments received in light of the factors set 

3 6 3 6 
-2-
f°rth i n § 3 ( c ) 0f th e Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)), and the considerations 
deified in § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). 
Applicant, the eighth largest multi-bank organization in 
Pi 
°rida, controls nine banks with aggregate deposits of $534 million, 
^Presenting approximately 2.7 per cent of the total commercial bank 
eP°sits in Florida. 
(All banking data are as of December 31, 1972, 
U n l e s s otherwise indicated, and reflect holding company acquisitions 
aPproved through August 15, 1973.) North American, the 31st largest 
^ti-bank organization in the State, controls two banks with deposits 
Of 6-jp *' million, representing 0.1 per cent of the commercial bank 
^Posits in Florida. Consummation of the proposed acquisition would 
lllCrease Applicant's control of Statewide deposits to approximately 
2.8 p e r cent, which is regarded as no significant increase in the con-
oration of banking resources in Florida, and would not change 
Appi. 
C a n t's ranking among Florida multi-bank organizations. 
In addition to controlling a banking subsidiary in St. Petersburg 
n d ° n e in Clearwater, North American (total assets of $3.8 million) 
b e s Primarily in mortgage banking activities. Through offices 
C a t e d in Pinellas, Sarasota, and Orange Counties, North American 
oriKl 
nated $io million in residential mortgage loans in 1972 and at the 
d o f December, 1972, was servicing a mortgage loan portfolio of 
$X2° * U l l o n . 
/ 

3637 
-3-
Applicant's only subsidiary bank in the South Pinellas County 
banking market is located in St. Petersburg and is the second largest 
of ^ e 28 banks (18 banking organizations) there, controlling (as of 
Jutle 3 0, 1972) 16 per cent of the market deposits. North American's 
* Petersburg banking subsidiary (deposits of $3 million) is one of 
f J 
V e new banks which opened in the South Pinellas market since June, 1972, 
atl(i is located in a suburban area somewhat removed from the downtown 
lo 
Cation of Applicant's subsidiary. The South Pinellas market is not 
highly concentrated with the five largest organizations controlling 
° n l y 6 5 Per cent of the total market deposits. There has been considerable 
«ntry i n t o 
ma^et recently, and several de novo applications 
h a V e b e e n filed. In light of these factors, the elimination of the 
l l g h t degree of competition that exists between Applicant's and 
° r t h American's banking subsidiaries would cause no significant adverse 
eff*cts. 
N 
Applicant's St. Petersburg bank is also a minor competitor 
°f Hort-k American for mortgages on one-to-four-unit residences in 
^ineiiQ 
i as County. In 1972 Applicant originated 0.3 per cent of such 
ioana -i 
i n that market while North American (through offices in Clearwater 
St 
c* Petersburg) originated 3.5 per cent. Since there are at least 
t6age companies and 10 savings and loan associations in addition 
to 25 i 
Danking organizations in Pinellas County and since Applicant and 
v t h 
A 
american have such a small combined share of the residential 

3638 
-4~ 
m°rtgage loan market, removal of competition between the two will not 
b e significant. Likewise, although Applicant possesses the resources 
enter the mortgage banking business in Pinellas County by establishing 
a m°rtgage banking company or to expand the mortgage lending activities 
" its St. 
Petersburg subsidiary bank, foreclosure of Applicant as a 
fe. £ovo entrant is unlikely to have significant adverse competitive 
effects in this attractive, competitive market which has been marked by 
Y*n J growth and ease of entry. 
The likelihood of North American's expansion of its mortgape 
Wilkin 
x n8 operations into markets served by Applicant's banking sub-
81 <Jj 
aries is small. Although these markets are attractive, North 
merican's resources do not appear to be sufficient for extensive geo-
6raPhic expansion. 
There are no other markets in which Applicant's subsidiary 
bankc? ^ 
Presently compete with any office of North American or any of 
N 0 r t h 
American's banking subsidiaries. Since Applicant's nearest sub-
a ry bank is 26 miles away, there is no competition between any of 
^Pplic 
cat*t s subsidiary banks and North American's Clearwater bank. Nor 
A 
applicant have a subsidiary located in the Sarasota market where 
American has a branch office engaging in mortgage banking. Although 
App-j^ 
Cai*t has recently received approval to acquire a subsidiary bank 
Z 0fa 
n8e County (Orlando), this new subsidiary does not compete with 
American's mortgage banking office in Orange County because the 

3639 
-5-
3"atter's office is a collection office only and does not originate loans. 
Th 
e Board concludes that the acquisition would have no significant 
adverse effects on the competitive situation or the concentration of 
ar*king resources in any relevant area. 
The financial and managerial aspects and future prospects of 
^Plicant and its subsidiary banks and North American and its subsidiary 
a n k s a re generally satisfactory and consistent with approval of the 
apPUcation. Applicant has recently provided additional capital for 
everal of its subsidiary banks and has made a commitment of a capital 
A c t i o n into its only banking subsidiary where the equity capital 
baa© -i 
J-s somewhat low. 
There is no evidence in the record that the primary banking 
8 °f the markets in which North American banking subsidiaries 
a t e are not being adequately served by existing banks, but North 
Itlerican's banking subsidiaries will have access to larger lending 
liljH *. 
c s and expertise in several banking fields through affiliation with 
Ppli 
cant. Moreover, North American's mortgage banking business will 
have K 
°etter access to capital which will permit it to expand and to com-
pete ^ 
Riore effectively. This increased capability is a positive,-factor 
In t e 
CI!1S of public needs and convenience. 
Considerations relating to 
the convenience 
and needs of the communities involved lend some weight 
r aPProval of the applications. There is no evidence in the record 
^dlcnn 
C l ng that consummation of the proposed acquisitions would result

Undue concentration of resources, unfair competition, conflicts of 
Merest, unsound banking practices, or other adverse effects. 
Applicant has indicated that it does not seek to acquire North 
^rican's insurance business, North American Insurance Agency, Inc., 
V h i ch engages in the sale of casualty, fire, life, health and accident 
insurance policies. This business will remain in the hands of North 
American's present stockholders. This spin-off or separation of the 
u^ance agency from the parent North American Mortgage Corporation will 
° C C u r Prior to consummation of the acquisition. 
It is the Board's judg-
e n t that the balance of public interest factors the Board is required to 
°Usider under § 4(c)(8) is favorable and the proposed acquisition 
^not including insurance activities) should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the masons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated

De novo entry into the Dubuque market is a reasonable alternative 
iti 
view of the fact that Dubuque is a regional center for the tri-State 
area(eastern Iowa, northwestern Illinois, and southwestern Wisconsin), 
n(1 its future prospects appear to be favorable in view of the facts of 
Cor<*> including the following: Population growth in the market; renova-
tion of fr-t

°Pping center; and establishment of two industrial parks, a 215-acre

B 
ne Board is of the view that Applicant can be viewed as one of the 
likely de novo entrants. Furthermore, there are, in fact, foothold 
o f 0 _ 
. 
entry into the market which are less anticompetitive than is 
s Proposal. Given the character of the Dubuque banking market, the 
Ptobahii 
lity of Applicant as a potential entrant into such market and 
°Pportunities for d e novo or "foothold" entry, the B o a r d is of the 
viev t h 
approval of this proposal would have a significantly adverse 
°n potential competition. 
^ 
Another factor arguing against approval of this application is 
ffict that acquisition of Bank by Applicant would eliminate the possibility 
w°uld develop into the lead bank of a regional bank holding com-
certainly would appear to have the managerial and financial 
^sou,. 
s to SO develop since it is the tenth largest banking organization 
^ e st t-
ate. At present, there is no mult-fbank holding company representation 
in 
entire northeast section of Iowa.

The Department of Justice has commented on this application and 
recomniended that it be denied due to the elimination of existing competition 
a s between Applicant's mortgage banking subsidiary, Iowa Securities Company, 
an office in Dubuque, and Bank. In response, Applicant contends that 
t h e residential real estate mortgage business of Bank and Iowa Securities 
Co*Pany i n t h e D u b uque area does not constitute a substantial volume of 
busines8; and, furthermore, Bank and Iowa Securities Company "are not 
i n t he same residential mortgage loan market," However, it is the Board's 
that approval could, given the structural changes taking place in 
^ t g a g e lending, eliminate significant competition in the 1-4 family 
ra°rt8age origination market in the Dubuque SMSA. Accordingly, the Board 
Cor*ludes that the competitive factors of this application weigh against 
approval. 
The financial condition and managerial resources and future 
Pr°8Pects of Applicant, its existing subsidiary banks, and Bank are 
f a c t o r y and consistent with approval of the application. 
However, 
factors do not outweigh the anticompetitive effects flowing from 
thl 
s Proposal, There is no indication in the record that the banking 
^ d a of the relevant market are not being met. Accordingly, although 
C°aslderations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities 
t0 b e served are consistent with approval they do not outweigh the adverse 
C0lnPetitiVe effects of the proposal. It is the Board's judgment that 
Crv 
Animation of the proposed acquisition would not be in the public 
and that the application should be denied.

On the basis of the record, the application is denied for the

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF GOVERNORS MITCHELL AND SHEEHAN 
We concur in the Board's action denying Applicant's proposal to 
a c q m r e 
the First National Bank of Dubuque on the grounds that consummation 
of the proposal would have significantly adverse effects on potential com-
petition in the Dubuque area. However, we disagree with the 
delusion that the transaction would result in the elimination of significant 
listing competition in the 1-4 family Dubuque mortgage banking market as 
betWeen Bank and Applicant's mortgage banking subsidiary, Iowa Securities 
Co*Pany. 
The facts of record indicate that Bank's 1-4 family mortgage loans 
a r e almost entirely conventional loans which are not government insured, 
the other hand, virtually all of Iowa Securities Company's mortgages are 
or VA insured. In our view, it is clear that Bank and Iowa Securities 
n 
0lnPany each serves a distinct type of customer and provides mortgage loans 
°f C e r e n t varieties and, accordingly, no meaningful present competition 
W° U l d he eliminated between the two institutions in the 1-4 family mortgage 
However, we find that the other anticompetitive effects of the 
p°8al, which are described in the majority's statement, are not outweighed 
tlle public interest by any considerations reflected in the record,

The Board of Governors proposes to adopt; rules relating to 
activif.ies of former members and employees of the Board in matters 
connected with their duties or official responsibilities while employed 
hy the Boardo 
Although the Federal Criminal Code applies criminal sanctions 
against former officers and employees of the Government whose activities 
involve a conflict of interest or an appearance of such conflict, it is 
b eUeved that rules of the Board on this subject would provide additonal 
Protection to the public as well as to both present and former employees.

^crease in the last few years in the number of the Board's employees

VICE CHAIRMAN 
September 20, 1973 
Dear Sir: 
Last spring you honored a request to assist and cooperate 
^ith Federal Reserve System actions, taken as part of the nation's 
anti-inflationary program, by holding a 3 per cent reserve against 
•"•^creases in certain bank liabilities. 
Your cooperation has been 
elpful ana is deeply appreciated. 
You may be interested to know 
jjat nonmember banks representing about half the deposits of all 
hose banks with whom we communicated are participating in this 
pr°gram. 
I would like now to ask for your further assistance in aid-
l ng the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb excessive expansion in bank 
^redit. 
Effective today, member banks will be required to hold an 
Per cent reserve requirement (the regular 5 per cent plus a supple-
mental 6 per cent) on the amount by which the sum of the following 
a nk liabilities exceeds the average level outstanding in the week 
®nded May 16 ( o r $10 million, whichever is greater): 
(1) time deposits 
i n denominations of $100,000 or over, (2) bank related commercial paper: 
(3) finance bills. 
A copy of the press release announcing this 
cnange i n member bank marginal reserve requirements is attached for 
U r information and guidance. 
The Federal Reserve action immediately increases the supple-
reserve requirements to 6 per cent of the sum of the listed 
ligations in excess of the May 16 base; thus, it immediately imposes 
increase in reserve requirements on affected institutions even if 
ley issue no more of the covered liabilities. 
In order to enhance the effectiveness of the action taken by 
Board, I hope that you may see fit to accept the newly added reserve 
3 Per cent. 

3655 
2 -
As before, cooperating nonmember banks will be asked to deposit 
the additional reserves with a member bank of the Federal Reserve System 
°f their choosing. The member bank will be expected to redeposit these 
balances with its Federal Reserve Bank. 
In accordance with the position set forth in Chairman Burns' 
letter of May 16, the request I am now making of you will be withdrawn 
at the earliest time consistent with the national interest. 
In the mean-
time, I hope that I can count on your continued cooperation in our efforts 
t o restrain inflation and return the economy to a more normal course. 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir: 
Last spring, as part of the Federal Reserve's program to curb 
e*cessive bank credit expansion, we addressed a request to a number of 
^ e larger nonmember banks to hold 3 per cent reserves against increases 
l n certain bank liabilities. 
Nonmember banks accounting for about half 
the deposits of that group have thus far voluntarily participated in 
t h e Program. 
In view of the continuing inflationary pressures facing our 
j^onomy, the Board of Governors recently took action, effective today, 
t o require member banks to hold an 11 per cent reserve requirement (the 
r e8ul a r 
5 per cent plus a supplemental 6 per cent) on the amount by which 
Z1® sum of certain bank liabilities exceeds the average level outstanding 
* the week ended May 16 (or $10 million, whichever is greater). 
A copy 
o f the press release announcing these changes is attached for your infor-
mation. 
Nonmember banks that are participating in the program have also 
G e n asked to conform voluntarily to the additional requirements. 
, 
I am bringing this matter to your attention at this time in the 
?Pe that you will review your position with respect to participation in 
h e Program.

Dear Sir: 
Last spring you agreed to cooperate with the Federal Reserve 
System by voluntarily (1) holding an 8 per cent reserve on any increase 
(above the average for May) in net funds obtained from foreign banks 
a n d (2) holding a 3 per cent reserve on the growth of specified deposits 
a nd other liabilities in excess of the amount outstanding in the week 
euded May 16, 1973 (or $10 million, whichever is greater). 
Your sup-
has been helpful to our efforts to bring monetary and credit aggre-
gates under better control in this inflationary period. 
Effective today, member banks will be required to hold an 11

^ Per cent) on the amount by which the sum of the following bank liabil-
ities exceeds the average level outstanding in the week ended May 16 (or 
million, whichever is greater): 
(1) time deposits in denominations 
o f $100 ,000 or over, (2) bank related commercial paper, and (o) finance 
JHls. 
A copy of the press release announcing these changes in member 
bank marginal reserve requirements is attached for your information and 
guidance. 
In order to enhance the effectiveness of this action, we now 
request your additional cooperation in increasing the reserves you deposit 
W i t h a member bank of the Federal Reserve System from 3 per cent to 6 per 
Cent of the amount by which the aforementioned specified deposits and 
o the r liabilities exceed your May 16 base. 
This would parallel the treat-
m e n t of member banks as well as that of the nonmember commercial banks 
that agree to a similar request I am making today. 
Since the 8 per cent reserve requirement has not been changed 
f° r member banks' foreign borrowings -- primarily Eurodollars -- we are 
U°t requesting that you increase the reserves you hold against your hor-
d i n g 
f r o m b a n k s abroad, including your head office.

As before, the additional reserve on domestic bank liabilities 
should be deposited with a member bank of the Federal Reserve System of 
your choosing. That member bank will redeposit 100 per cent of all such 
balances with its Federal Reserve Bank. 
Your continuing cooperation in this voluntary program of credit 
restraint is deeply appreciated. 
Sincerely yours, 
Attachment

Sample letter to State bank supervisors 
spring the Board imposed a 3 per cent marginal reserve on increases 
i n certain liabilities of member banks as part of a series of actions 
taken to curb the rapid expansion of bank credit and to help moderate 
ionary pressures. At that time, we addressed a request to a 
number of the largest nonmember banks and certain foreign-owned banking 
institutions in the United States to conform voluntarily to the 3 per 
Cent marginal reserve requirement. 
As you may be aware, the Board 
r°cently acted to increase the marginal reserve requirement imposed on 
Member banks from 3 to 6 per cent. A copy of the press release announc-
e s this action is attached. 
1 now wish to inform you that I am addressing today a request to those 
n°nmember banks that have been voluntarily maintaining the 3 per cent 
^rginal reserve to conform to the new 6 per cent requirement. 
Other 
r£e nonmember banks also are being advised of this action. At the 
Same time, I am writing to certain foreign-owned banking institutions 
l n the United States to request their continued cooperation. 
Copies 
these letters are attached for your information. As you may know, 
tl*is matter was discussed with the Board of Directors of the Conference 
o f State Bank Supervisors at a meeting here last week. 
Board earnestly believes that the voluntary cooperation of these 
financial institutions continues to be needed in our efforts to restrain 
bank credit growth. 
You have our continued assurance that 
hesG requests will be withdrawn at the earliest possible time consis-
e n t with the national interest. 
Sincerely yours,

VICE CHAIRMAN

^ a r Sir: 
kast spring, as part of the Federal Reserve's program to curb excessive 
bank credit expansion, we addressed a request to a number of the larger 
n°niuember banks to hold 3 per cent reserves against increases in 
^rtain bank liabilities. At that time, you indicated that your bank 
not have sufficient liabilities of the types covered to be subject 
t o the marginal reserve requirement. 
will be interested to know that nonmember banks accounting for 
^bout half the deposits of those banks that were approached have thus 
a r voluntarily participated in the program. 
view of the continuing inflationary pressures facing our economy, the 
°ard of Governors recently took action, effective today, to require 
^ember banks to hold an 11 per cent reserve requirement (the regular 
P er cent plus a supplemental 6 per cent) on the amount by which the 
sum of certain bank liabilities exceeds the average level outstanding 
iT1 the week ended May 16 (or $10 million, whichever is greater). 
A 
of the press release announcing these changes is attached for your 
^formation, 
Nonmember banks that are participating in the program have 
s ° been asked to conform voluntarily to the additional requirements. 
* am bringing this matter to your attention at this time for your informa-
l 0 n> in the event that your large certificates of deposit outstanding 
other subject liabilities, may increase to a level calling for 
intenance of marginal reserves. 
Sincerely yours, 
George W. My^chell
