First Pennsylvania Corporation. 
In a memorandum dated Sep-
tember 25, 1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended 
approval of the application of First Pennsylvania Corporation, Phila-
delphia, Pennsylvania, a bank holding company, (1) to acquire directly, 
or indirectly through a Delaware corporation, shares of F.I.B.I. Holding 
Company Limited, a company registered in Israel, and (2) to acquire 
indirectly through F.I.B.I. Holding Company Limited (a) shares of 
First International Bank of Israel, Limited, (b) shares of Mortgage 
and Savings Bank, an Israeli mortgage bank, and (c) shares of Moritz 
and Tuchler, Ltd., a Tel Aviv stock brokerage firm. A draft letter 
reflecting approval was attached to the memorandum. 
In connection with this application the Legal Division, in a 
memorandum dated September 27, 1972, recommended that the Board make 
a preliminary ruling that section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act 
governs loans by a member bank to a foreign bank subsidiary of its 
parent holding company. 
The Board unanimously approved the application and the Legal 
Division's recommendation. 
It was understood that the letter to the 
applicant would be revised to incorporate certain changes suggested 
by Governor Brimmer. A copy of the letter as sent is attached as 
Item No. 9. 
Banco di Roma. 
In memoranda dated September 8, 1972, the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended (1) approval of 

2G39 
9/28/72 
-5-
the application of Banco di Roma S.p.A., Rome, Italy, to become a 
bank holding company through the acquisition of shares of Banco di 
Roma (Chicago), Chicago, Illinois, a proposed new bank, and (2) denial 
of the application of Banco di Roma S.p.A. to retain shares of Euro-
Partners Securities Corporation, New York, New York. The Banking 
Markets Section concurred in the recommendations, while the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago recommended approval of both applications 
(contingent upon certain assurances with respect to the second). 
In a memorandum dated September 20, 19 72, the Legal Division recommen-
ded denial of the application to retain shares of EuroPartners Securi-
ties Corporation. Attached to the memorandum was a draft order that 
would require Banco di Roma to divest its ownership of shares of 
EuroPartners within two years after becoming a bank holding company. 
In another memorandum dated September 20, 1972, the Legal 
Division noted that 91 per cent of the shares of Banco di Roma 
apparently were owned by the Industrial Reconstruction Institute 
(IRI), a holding company owned by the Italian Government, and raised 
a question whether IRI should be required to apply for permission to 
become a bank holding company. The Division recommended that the 
Board (1) informally request Banco di Roma to provide it annually 
with copies of the IRI annual reports and (2) conduct examinations 
of Banco di Roma (Chicago) to ascertain the extent and terms of credit 
relationships of the bank with IRI affiliates.

The Board unanimously approved the application to acquire 
shares of Banco di Roma (Chicago), unanimously denied the application 
to retain shares of EuroPartners Securities Corporation, and authorized 
issuance of orders reflecting these decisions. The Board also expressed 
agreement with the Legal Division's recommendation regarding Banco di 
Roma's relationship with the Industrial Reconstruction Institute, with 
the understanding that an appropriate letter would be sent to the appli-
cant. Copies of the orders are attached as Items 10 and 11. A copy 
of the letter subsequently sent to Banco di Roma is attached as 
Item No. 12. 
Governor Daane withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
Trust Company of New Jersey. In a memorandum dated September 13, 
1972, the Legal Division recommended denial of a request by The Trust 
Company of New Jersey, Jersey City, New Jersey, for reconsideration of 
its application to merge with a wholly-owned nonoperating subsidiary 
of Wilshire Oil Company of Texas, New York, New York. In a memorandum 
dated September 25, 1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
recommended denial of the request. In a letter of September 20, 1972, 
the New York Reserve Bank recommended that the Board indicate its 
willingness to accept an amended application, subject to conditions 
that would overcome the objections cited in the Board's order of 
July 27, 1972, denying the application. 
The Board unanimously denied the request and authorized 
issuance of an order reflecting that decision. A copy of the order 

2o4i 
9/28/72 
-7-
is attached as Item No. 13. The Board also agreed not to encourage 
submission of an amended application, since the objections cited in 
its order denying the application would not be overcome by conditions 
recommended by the Reserve Bank. 
Chairman Burns entered the meeting at this point. 
Western Bancshares. 
In a memorandum dated September 27, 1972, 
the Legal Division recommended denial of a request by Western Bancshares, 
Inc., Stockton, Kansas, for reconsideration of its application to retain 
shares of Rooks County State Bank, Woodston, Kansas. 
The Board unanimously denied the request and authorized issuance 
of an order reflecting that decision. A copy of the order is attached 
as Item No. 14. 
All members of the staff then withdrew except Messrs. Holland, 
Melnicoff, Smith, Greenspan, O'Connell, and Solomon, 
Retention of special counsel. In a memorandum dated September 27, 
1972, Mr. O'Connell recommended that the Board retain Herbert John 
Miller, Jr., Esq., of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller, Cassidy, 
Larroca & Lewin, as special counsel to represent the Board in the 
removal proceeding involving Louis J. Roussel, a director of National 
American Bank of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana. Mr. Miller 
would be compensated at the rate of $100 per hour, plus $50 per hour 
for work performed by juniors and assistants in the firm.

During today's discussion questions were raised whether the 
Comptroller of the Currency might be willing to pay all or a portion 
of Mr. Miller's fees, but it was agreed that the Board would pay all 
the fees, 
The Board thereupon approved retention of Mr. Miller as 
special counsel, on the terms and under the conditions set forth in 
the letter attached as Item No. 15. It was understood that Mr. Miller 
would be encouraged to make maximum use of Board resources. 
Regulations D and J. Mr. Melnicoff reported on recent develop-
ments with respect to the delay in implementation of the amendments 
to Regulation D, Reserves of Member Banks, and Regulation J, Collection 
of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks, and the effect of 
the delay on membership in Regional Check Processing Centers. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Genelemon: 
Pursuant to section 217.1(f) (3) (i) of Regulation Q and 
section 204.1(f)(3)(i) of Regulation D, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System approves the issuance of up to $500,000 
in subordinated capital notes by Trenton State Bank, Trenton, 
Michigan, in the form submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Chicago. This approval is given on the condition that the capital 
notes cannot be called for redemption prior to maturity without the 
approval of the Federal Reserve Bank. Approval is granted with the 
understanding that the sale of these capital notes will be consum-
mated within six-months from the date of this letter. It is further

FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION OF TEXAS, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Voting Shares of Bank 
First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc., Houston, Texas, a 
bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, 
has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) to acquire 334 of the voting shares of The Lake Jackson 
tiank of Lake Jackson, Texas, Lake Jackson, Texas. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
a

^ light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C.

Applicant controls 
10 banks with aggregate deposits of about 
$1.6 billion dollars, representing approximately 5.2 per cent of the

The transaction involves neither an expansion of Applicant nor an 
increase in the banking resources controlled by it. Consummation of the 
proposal will not adversely affect existing or potential competition.

The financial and managerial resources and prospects of Applicant, 
its subsidiaries, and Bank are regarded as generally satisfactory. The 
proposed sale of stock under the stock rights offering will add needed 
capital to the Bank; acquisition of the 334 voting shares by Applicant 
will help provide such capital. The convenience and needs of the community 
involved would not be affected by consummation of Applicant's proposal.

FIRST NATIONAL STATE BANCORPORATION 
9/28/72 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First National State Bancorporation, Newark, New Jersey, a 
bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company 
Act, has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares 
(less directors
1
 qualifying shares) of First National State Bank of 
Ocean County, Lakewood, New Jersey, the successor by merger to Trust 
Company of Ocean County, Lakewood, New Jersey ("Ocean Bank"). 
The 
b
ank into which Ocean Bank is to be merged (the resulting bank) has 
no significance except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of 
Ocean Bank, Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the shares of 
the successor organization is treated herein as the proposed acquisi-
tion of shares of Ocean Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interest-
ed persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance 
with 5 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has 
expired, and the Board has considered the application and all comments 
received in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls six banks with aggregate deposits of 
$1.2 billion, representing 7.2 per cent of the total commercial bank 
deposits in New Jersey and is the largest banking organization in the 

26 
-2-
1/ 
State."" Acquisition of Ocean Bank ($31.3 million deposits) would in-
crease Applicant
f
s share of New Jersey bank deposits by .2 percentage 
Points. 
Subject acquisition would represent Applicant's initial entry 
into New Jersey's Third Banking District. Ocean Bank is the twenty-
third largest of 60 banks in this district and the sixth largest of 
eight banks located in the Lakewood-Toms River market. It controls 
1 per cent and 8.4 per cent of total deposits for the district and 
market, respectively, and is the third largest of five competing area 
banks which control deposits ranging from $198 million to $3 million. 
It appears that Applicant's acquisition of Ocean Bank would not ad-
versely affect the other area banks. 
No significant present competition exists between Applicant's 
Present subsidiaries and Ocean Bank. Their nearest offices are 12 miles 
apart with five banks located in the intervening area. It also appears 
unlikely that an appreciable amount of future competition would develop 
between them because of the separation of their market areas, and the 
restrictions on branching imposed by State laws. Moreover, the pro-
posed acquisition would not act as a deterrent to entry by other groups 
into the market since there are a number of independent banks available 
for acquisition. Competitive considerations are consistent with ap-
proval of the application.

The financial conditions and managerial resources of Applicant, 
its subsidiary banks, and Ocean Bank arc generally satisfactory, and 
prospects for each are favorable. Banking factors appear to be consis-
tent with approval of the application. Whereas the major banking needs 
the area are served at the present time, the introduction by Applicant 
°f trust and computer services and accounts receivable financing at 
Ocean Bank would serve the convenience of its customers. In addition, 
the affiliation would enable Ocean Bank to serve the larger credit 
requirements of the rapidly growing area. Considerations relating to 
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served are consistent 
w
ith and add some weight toward approval of the application. It is the 
Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
thic Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
°r by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pursuant to delegated authority.

$168.7 million representing 2.4 per cent of total deposits of commercial 
banks in the Houston area. Upon consummation of the acquisition of Bank, 
applicant's share of commercial bank deposits in the State would increase 
ky .2 percentage points and its ranking among banking organizations in the 
State would be unchanged. Consummation of the proposal herein would con-
stitute Applicant's initial entry into the San Angelo banking market. 
Bank ($70 million of deposits) operates one banking office located 
^ downtown San Angelo and is the largest of five banks operating in that 
Market largely by virtue of its correspondent bank and public deposits 
l
'hich total approximately $20 million. The Central National Bank of San 
Angelo ($63.2 million of deposits) and The First National Bank of San 
J/ On August 31, 1972, the Board approved Applicant's application to 
Squire American National Bank of Beaumont, Beaumont, Texas ($112 million 
°f deposits). At the same time the Board directed Applicant to divest 
shares of Beaumont State Bank, Beaumont, Texas ($25 million of deposits) 
w
hich would be acquired indirectly through Applicant's acquisition of 
American National Bank, On September 1, 1972, the Board approved Appli-
cant's applications to acquire the successors by merger to Airline 
B
ank ($26.5 million of deposits) and Reagan State Bank of Houston 
($65 
Million of deposits), both of Houston, Texas. Applicant is in the process 
o f
 organizing seven de novo banks located in the Houston market.

A
ngelo ($38 million of deposits), the second and third largest banks in 
bank's market, control respectively 33.4 and 20 per cent of total deposits 
of commercial banks In the area. Bank ranks second in the market on 
the basis of total IPC deposits with 33.5 per cent of the total, compared 
ttith 33.8 per cent for The Central National Bank of San Angelo. If the 
ttC deposits of The First National Bank of San Angelo are combined with 
those of its affiliate, West Side National Bank of San Angelo, First 
National's IPC deposit total represents 27.4 per cent of the market total. 
^hus, size disparity among the top banks is not so wide as to enable Bank 
t o
 dominate the San Angelo banking market. Bank is affiliated through 
common share ownership with three other banks located in the west Texas 
2/ 
a
*ea. 
Although two of these banks have been under common ownership along 
^ith Bank since 1961, the record indicates that they have not been operated 
cooperatively as a group. The common majority shareholders have not taken an 
active part in the management of these banks and have stated that they have 
n
° intention of doing so in the future. Nor do the facts of record evidence 
that this group of banks possesses either the financial or managerial re-
sources to form a regional holding company. 
Applicant's two present subsidiary banks are located in Houston, 
T e
*as, more than 360 miles southeast of Bank. It appears that no meaning-
ful 
competition exists between Bank and any of Applicant's subsidiary or 
associated banks. Further, it appears unlikely that meaningful competition 
*ould develop in the future between Bank and any of Applicant's subsidiary 
associated banks in light of the facts presented, particularly the 
" T h e s e three banks are Citizens National Bank, Lubbock, Texas ($105.5 
Million of deposits); American Bank of Commerce ($43.5 million of deposits); 
a
nd Permian Bank and Trust ($4.7 million of deposits), both of Odessa,

^istances separating these banks and the Texas statutes prohibiting branch 
b
^nking. Applicant could enter the San Angelo market de novo or conceivably 
through the acquisition of the only smaller bank in that market that 
is presently unaffiliated. However, there is no indication as to the 
a v
ailability for purchase of this unaffiliated bank and, in any case, its 
^cation does not lend itself for effective competition with the downtown 
S
an Angelo banks. The facts of record indicate that the prospects for 
e
ntry 
novo by Applicant are remote. While the population per banking 
office ratio for the San Angelo market is above the ratio for the entire 
S
tate. as noted in one of the Dissenting Opinions, it is below the ratio 
Texas metropolitan areas (the State average ratio is brought down by 
the relatively low population per banking office in the sparsely populated 
*
u
ral areas of Texas). The rate of population growth of the area is below 
t
be State average and below the rate for other Texas metropolitan area. 
T
he Se factors, in addition to others, including the relatively small deposit 
2/ 
s i
ze of the San Angelo banking market, 
indicate that the prospect 
for 
6
ntry de novo or through acquisition of a foothold bank In the San Angelo 
Market is unlikely. The record also indicates that the majority share-
holders of Bank intend to dispose of their shares of Bank (and their other 
hanking interests) even if the subject applications are denied. Acquisi-
tion of Bank by Applicant (or some other Statewide banking organization)

per cent of these deposits are deposits due to commercial banks, and 
hence were probably generated outside of the San Angelo market.

vould not appear to have an adverse effect on competition in the San Angelo 
market nor foreclose entry by other bank holding companies into the market. 
The second and third largest banks in the market each controls a 
signifi-
cant share of market deposits and each has evidenced its ability to com-
1/ 
Pete successfully with Bank. 
Furthermore, entry by Applicant may serve 
to stimulate competition among the three largest banks in the market, 
either through Applicant's Initiative or through the probable entry of 
°ther banking organizations through acquisition of Bank's largest com-
petitors. To the extent this occurs, the subject proposal x-jill have pro-
competitive effects on banking in the San Angelo market. 
At the present time the level of concentration of banking 
Resources in Texas is not particularly high. As of December 31, 1971, 
there were 108 bank holding companies in the State controlling 47.4 
Per cent of the assets and 44.8 per cent of the deposits of all commercial 
b
anks in the State. In August 1972, the 15 multibank organizations in 
the State controlled 34.2 per cent of the deposits in the State and the 
four largest of these organizations controlled 24.3 per cent and 21.7 
Per cent of assets and deposits, respectively. The Board does not view 
the present level of either asset or deposit concentration of commercial 
hanks in Texas to be so significantly high as to lessen the ability of 
T
exas bank holding companies to develop and compete effectively on either 
a regional or Statewide basis. There remain throughout the State a large 
number of moderately-sized independent banks which are available as 
^?~Bank's share of deposits of commercial banks in the San Angelo market 
has declined from 46.4 per cent to the present 36.9 per cent from 1961 
to 1971.

Potential members of banking organizations now developing in the State, 
inking organizations in Texas are presently unable to satisfy the 
capital demands of the large industrial concerns which have located in 
the State. Proposals involving the largest banking organizations in the 
State require the weighing by the Board of the impact of further concen-
tration of banking resources with the need to increase the ability of 
Texas banks to satisfy the financial requirements of these large corpora-
tions. The effect upon concentration of banking resources of the present 
Proposal is not so significant as to outweigh the probable benefits to be 
achieved from consummation of the proposal. 
On the record before it, the Board concludes that consummation 
the subject proposal would not result in a monopoly nor be in further-
ance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business 
°f banking in any area, nor have any substantially anticompetitive effects. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of Applicant 
and its subsidiary banks appear satisfactory and future prospects of all 
seem favorable. The financial condition and management of Bank appears 
satisfactory and its future prospects appear favorable and consistent 
With approval. The major banking needs of the residents of the San Angelo 
area appear to be adequately served at the present time by existing 
institutions. However, Applicant has stated its intention to make available 
through Bank additional banking services such as real estate, international 
hanking and petroleum financing services. Such services would be made 
available to several industrial interests operating in the San Angelo area

that must now obtain larger loans and more sophisticated banking services 
from larger city banks outside the San Angelo market. 
Considerations 
relating to the convenience and needs of the relevant areas are consistent 
with and lend some weight toward approval of the application. It is the 
Board's judgment that consummation of the proposed transaction is in the 
Public interest and the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
I dissent from the majority's action approving the applica-
tion by the fourth largest banking organization in Texas to enter the 
San Angelo banking market through acquisition of the largest bank in 
that market controlling 37 per cent of total deposits of commercial 
banks in that area. Consummation of the proposed acquisition will 
have significant adverse competitive consequences in the San Angelo 
market and throughout the State which are not outweighed by benefits 
flowing to the banking public in any area of the State. The facts of 
this proposal illustrate well the adverse effects upon the structure of 
banking in the State resulting from acquisition of the largest, most 
viable independent banks in various banking markets throughout the 
1/ 
State by the largest banking organizations in Texas. 
Acquisition by Applicant of San Angelo National Bank repre-
sents a continuation of the holding company's aggressive expansion 
throughout the State and the first step in its attempt to acquire an 
existing banking organization in west Texas composed of San Angelo 
National Bank and three other banks; two located in Odessa and one in 
Lubbuck, Texas, controlling aggregate deposits of approximately one 
quarter of a billion dollars. 
p. 
The three largest banks in the San Angelo market control 
95 per cent of total market deposits. Acquisition of the largest 
bank in that market by Applicant should significantly strengthen

the competitive advantage already held by San Angelo National Bank 
and thereby concentrate further banking resources in this highly 
concentrated market. Contrary to the conclusion of the majority, 
1
 find that the record indicates that the San Angelo market is 
attractive for entry either de novo or through acquisition of a 
Waller "foothold" bank. Population in the San Angelo area continues 
t o
 expand (9 per cent from 1960-1970) and the population per banking 
°ffice of San Angelo (14,200) is significantly above the State average 
(9,276). The record fails to indicate any basis for not requiring 
Applicant to choose between the two procompetitive alternatives of 
de novo or foothold entry rather than permitting the anticompetitive 
Method of entry through acquisition of a position of dominance in the 
S a
n Angelo market. It is this latter method which is being proposed 
f r
equently by the State's largest banking organizations and it is this 
trend which, in the long run, can only serve to discourage the develop-
ment of additional banking alternatives. 
Permitting acquisitions of the largest banks in other markets 
b
V the State's largest banking organizations also discourages the growth 
o f
 other banking organizations which in certain cases may be better 
a b
le to serve the banking public of particular regions of a State than 
a
 larger organization headquartered several hundred miles away. Develop-
ment of such smaller organizations may serve to promote more effective 
competition than entry into these areas by more dominant banking organiza-
tions. In its Brief for the United States prepared for argument before 

-3-
2G81 
the Supreme Court in connection with United States of America v. First 
National Bancorporation, Inc. and First National Bank of Greeley, (329 
P. Supp. 1003), the Department of Justice states, 
"When a few leading institutions within a state enter 
most of that state's significant local banking markets by 
purchasing large market shares instead of competing for 
them, the same organizations begin to confront each other 
as the dominant factors in separate concentrated markets 
all over the state. This creates a real danger that the 
dominant banks, not faced with the difficulty of having 
to compete locally for survival—as would be the case had 
entry been made de novo or by foothold acquisition—will 
tacitly renounce vigorous competitive practices in the 
areas in which they operate; the fextf state leaders, 
facing each other in commonly linked oligopolistic markets, 
will be encouraged to pursue parallel practices in dis-
regard of local competitive conditions." 
The prospect of lessened competition indicates that the interests of 
the banking public are not well served by allowing the bulk of the 
State's commercial bank resources to become subject to the control of 
°
n
ly a few giant banking organizations. 
This proposal illustrates vividly how rapidly this undesirable 
concentration is taking place. This application is the first of four 
filed by Applicant, which are currently pending before the Board, for 
the acquisitions of a group of commonly owned west Texas banks. Majority 
s
hareholders of these banks have indicated a willingness to dispose of 
their share holdings in these and have stated their intention to locate 
°ther potential purchasers in the event this application be denied. 
These shareholders should be required to locate an alternative pur-
chaser whose entry into the San Angelo market would not have an adverse 
competitive effect on other banks in that market. I would deny this 
a
Pplication.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I dissent from the majority's action which permits the State's 
fourth largest banking organization to acquire the largest bank in the 
San Angelo market. This proposal presents issues of major significance 
to the future of banking competition in Texas as the large bank hold-
ing companies headquartered in the State's four major SMSA's are now 
seeking to enter other metropolitan areas. The proposed entry by 
Texas Commerce into San Angelo is typical of proposed methods of 
expansion by the State's largest banking organizations that the Board 
should expect in the future. It is imperative that the implications 
of such acquisitions be clearly stated and understood. 
To place the issues in perspective, I have looked carefully 
at the main features of the banking structure in the 25 Standard Metro-
politan Statistical Areas (SMSA's) in Texas. Several of these key 
features are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, attached. The available 
evidence indicates clearly that entry into smaller metropolitan areas by 
the State's largest banking organizations through acquisitions of the 
largest independent commercial banks in these areas will increase 
already undesirable levels of deposit concentration. As indicated in 
Table 1, of the 25 SMSA's in Texas, San Angelo is in the group comprised 
of the State's smallest SMSA's (i.e., the group with population of less 
than 100,000). Of particular concern is the fact that in these smaller 
metropolitan areas deposit concentration is extremely high. For instance, 
in six of the seven SMSA's in this group, the share of deposits held by 
the three largest banks exceeds 80 per cent. In the San Angelo market, 
; 

-2-
2663 
the three largest banks control more than 90 per cent of total deposits. 
It is clear that these highly concentrated markets will become less 
concentrated only if the major holding companies enter de novo or via 
"foothold" acquisitions. T-Jhere a banking market appears able to support 
additional banking alternatives (which is a fact in the present case), 
the best interests of the banking public in that market should not be 
subordinated to the financial interests of a large banking organization. 
Approval of this proposal would have precisely that effect. 
When the State's biggest bank holding companies reach out 
to acquire the largest banks in the tier of SMSA's beyond the four 
leading population centers, they are bound to have an adverse effect 
on the development of additional banking organizations in the State. 
Banks the size of San Angelo National may not be large enough to serve 
as lead banks of Statewide holding companies. However, they must be 
viewed as important potential members of other smaller banking organiza-
tions. As the data in Table 2 indicate, there are very few banks with 
deposits of between $50-100 million in the State. By permitting banks 
this size to become members of the largest banking organizations in 
the State, the Board loses an opportunity to encourage the development of 
a more balanced banking structure in Texas by preserving these banks 
for affiliation with banking organizations occupying less dominant 
competitive positions in the State as a whole. 
If the majority's decision in this case is followed by a 
series of others authorizing similar acquisitions, the large Houston and 
Dallas banking organizations—in a short time—will become dominant in 

-3-
2664 
almost all metropolitan area markets, and development of significant 
bank holding company organizations outside of these areas will be 
curtailed. 
As the Board considered the present application, it was 
aware that this is only one of four applications filed by Applicant to 
acquire an existing banking "network" controlled by similar majority 
shareholders who have decided to dispose of their interests in these 
west Texas banks. Certainly, the Eoard cannot direct the shareholders 
to sell or not to sell to any particular persons or organizations. 
However, where a proposal involves affiliation of the State's fourth 
largest banking organization with an existing organization which has the 
resource strength—if not present inclination—to become a significant 
regional organization in an area of little present bank holding com-
pany activity, the Board must weigh with particular care the adverse 
competitive consequences resulting from consummation of the proposal 
upon the structure of banking in Texas. Rather than approving this 
Proposal, the majority should have denied the application and thereby 
signaled its intention to restrict acquisitions of large independent 
banking organizations by the State's largest bank holding company 
organizations.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
Item No. 7 
9/28/72 
FIRST AT ORLANDO CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First at Orlando Corporation, Orlando, Florida, a bank hold-
ing company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
applied for the Board's approval under R 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) to acquire all of the voting shares (less directors' 
qualifying shares) of North Semoran First National Bank, Fern Park, 
Florida ("Semoran Bank"), a proposed new bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for inter-
ested persons to submit comments and viex-ys, has been given in accord-
ance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views 
has ejipired, and none has been timely received. The Board has con-
sidered the application in light of the factors set forth in S 3(c) of 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls 26 banks with aggregate deposits of 
$504.6 million, representing 5.6 per cent of the total commercial bank 
deposits in the State, and is the fourth largest banking organization 
and bank holding company in Florida. Since Semoran Bank is a proposed 
new bank, no esdsting competition would be eliminated nor would concen-
tration be increased in any relevant area. Semoran Bank would be 
located in the southern portion of Seminole County, a recently devel-
oping trade area with an estimated population of 45,000, and would be 
competing in the Orlando banking market, in which market Applicant 
controls 42.9 per cent of deposits. Applicant presently operates six 

2«6S 
-2-
banks in the Orlando banking market, the nearest of which -- First 
National Bank at Orlando -- is 9.5 miles south of Fern Park where the 
proposed Semoran Bank would be located. There is very little employ-
ment in the downtown Orlando area which would draw off commuters from 
Fern Park and thus place the two banks in competition. Additionally, 
there are numerous intervening banks. 
Applicant's share of deposits in the relevant market area 
has not increased since approval of its last Orlando de novo acquisi-
tion in 1969. The second largest bank holding company in the market 
controls 11.6 per cent of commercial deposits therein, while the third 
and fourth largest control 10.7 and 9.2 per cent, respectively. At the 
present time, there are seven multibank holding companies represented 
in the Orlando market, six of which are among the State's ten largest 
banking organizations. It appears that consummation of the proposal 
herein would not alter adversely the competitive situation nor the con-
centration of resources in the market, nor is there any evidence that 
Applicant's proposal is an attempt to pre-empt a site before there is 
a
 need for a bank. Applicant is not represented in Seminole County, 
the northern section of the Orlando market, where extensive suburban 
type growth is occurring. 
The financial and managerial resources and the future pros-
pects of Applicant and its subsidiary banks are regarded as generally 
satisfactory. Prospects for bank appear favorable. Semoran Bank 
*>ould be able to provide a local alternative banking source within 
the proposed service area, which is experiencing rapid growth. 

-3-
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the area to 
be served lend slight support to, and are consistent with, approval 
of the application. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed ac-
quisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
this Order or (b) later than three months after that date, and (c) 
North Scmoran First National Bank, Fern Park, Florida, shall be opened 
for business not later than six months after the effective date of this 
Order. Each of the periods described in (b) and (c) may be extended 
I 
for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 
I 
Pursuant to delegated authority.

By order of the Board of Governors, effective September 23, 1972.

Dissenting Statement of Governor Robertson 
With each successive Board approval of a de novo bank for 
First at Orlando Corporation in its home market, its dominance in that 
market is maintained, and the "invisible hand" of Adam Smith again 
stayed, The action of normal market forces would, in the usual course, 
slowly erode the high market share this Applicant holds in the Orlando 
area, Yet there has been no sign of deconcentration since Board approval 
1/ 
°f Applicant's formation as a holding company in 1967. 
The reason is 
obvious. Deposit growth has been won by the market leader; smaller 
hanks have received only a modest share. 
Other things being equal, purchasers of homogeneous banking 
services, i.e., those with well-known qualities that are 
s u b s t a n t i a l l y 
the same, w o u l d tend to distribute their patronage on a random basis, 
T h e r e s u l t w o u l d be a f a i r l y even distribution of the market - i n c l u d i n g 
a
n even distribution of the deposit growth in that market. Yet in the 
growing Orlando area, Applicant's share of market deposits - 42,9 per 
cent - has remained remarkably constant over time. The randomization 
P a t t e r n normally found for homogeneous products or services is not 
Present here. Instead, the public has displayed a preference for 
applicant
 f
s banking services over those offered by its competitors. 
^his preference, commonly referred to as "product differentiation", 
— - _ 
The Board's decision, and my dissent, in that case is published at 
967 Federal Reserve Bulletin 235; for the Board's decision, and my 
issent, to approve First at Orlando Corporation's acquisition of a 
S® novo bank established in the Orlando market in 1969, see 1969 
federal Reserve Bulletin 942, 

2 t i 
-2-
r e
presents Applicant's ability to distinguish or set apart its ovm 
services, in the minds of buyers, from those offered by its competi-
tors. 
Applicant's success in differentiating its banking services 
one of the principal benefits of its market dominance. Long recog-
nised as the leading banking institution in the Orlando market, it 
a t
tracts deposits from customers outside the primary service areas of 
i t s
 own offices. In fact, Applicant already controls in excess of 
milli o n in deposits and holds in excess of $3.8 million in loans 
l,
hich originate within the service area of the proposed new bank - an 
a r e
a in which it now has no office. Of the two banks presently located 
^thin this service area, one, with deposits 
of $27.8 million, is but 
city blocks from the site of the proposed new bank, while the other, 
l,
ith deposits of approximately $6.5 million, has only been open since 
^bruary,1971. It is doubtful whether eighteen months is a sufficient 
P°riod of time for this smaller bank to have achieved an adequate earn-
i n
Sc rate. Moreover, a third bank has had its charter approved but has 
n
°t yet opened for business on a site 2.7 miles south of the location of 
Applicant's proposed new bank. 
Here the cost experience for every de novo bank in the Orlando 
^
t 
symmetrical, none could be said to experience a disadvantage. 
S u t
 unlike entry in a competitive market, where differential experience 
*
n d
 reputation effects are, perforce, negligible, cost differences in 
Market with a dominant bank are to be anticipated precisely because 

2G72 
-3-
these factors are considerable. Thus, although it is generally es-
timated a d<s novo bank's net earnings during its first tuo or three 
V
e
ars of operation will be negligible or perhaps show a deficit, a 
fe novo bank established by the dominant firm in that market is likely 
t o
 realize profitable operations at an earlier date. It is not sur-
mising, therefore, to find the follox/ing statement by First at Orlando 
Corporation in its application: 
"Although the projection of earnings and expenses for the 
first year of operation indicates an anticipated loss for the 
period, it is expected that beginning in the second year of 
operation the Bank will begin to show an annual profit. The 
expected rate of growth in income and the projected modest ex-
penses for the first three years of operation is due in part to 
the assistance that will be forthcoming from the Applicant if 
this application is approved." 2/ 
S u
ch assistance, as described by Applicant, includes group purchasing, 
Printing, and advertising, as well as specialized services in the 
V a r
ious fields of banking policy and operation including internal 
S i t i n g and investment portfolio management. The assistance available 
this proposed new bank, enhancing its ability to become profitable 
s
°°n after commencing operations, clearly evidences Applicant's com-
petitive advantage in the Orlando market. It can hardly be questioned 
t l l a
t Applicant will, as it has in the past, experience little difficulty 
i n
 maintaining its dominant position or continue to successfully dif-
^ n t i a t e 
its services from those of competing organizations in the 
°
na
ndo market. 
No claim has been made in this case that Applicant's entry-
C
°
5
t advantages or ability to differentiate its banking services from 
I T — Application, Exhibit F, p. 56, 

2G73 
-3-
compctitors in the Orlando area are due to any superiority in the services 
A p p l i c a n t provides that m a r k e t . 
Instead, the evidence p o i n t s 
t o 
the undue concentration of banking resources and Applicant's dominant 
Position in the Orlando banking market as structural conditions which -
8 0
 long as they remain - provide Applicant an inherent advantage that 
competitors find difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. And while 
competitors may enjoy some umbrella effects from Applicant's dominance 
i n
 the Orlando area, so too they are likely to forego those aggressive 
3/ 
a c
tions which would be freely undertaken in a less concentrated market. 
short, banking rivalry in the Orlando area has been attenuated by a 
dominant organization. 
The same evil present in this case was observed by Judge 
Earned Hand in United States v. Alcoa, 140 F. 2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945). 
deferring to the undesirable effects of economic power which transgress 
antitrust laws, Judge Hand stated: 
"Many people believe that possession of unchallenged 
economic power deadens initiative, discourages thrift and 
depresses energy; that immunity from competition is a narcotic, 
and rivalry is a stimulant, to industrial progress; that the 
spur of constant stress is necessary to counteract an inevitable 
disposition to let x;ell enough alone." Id. at 427, 
I am one of those who share such beliefs. I must 
therefore 
di 
s
°nt to the approval of a de novo bank for this Applicant in a market 
^ 
Aa the Supreme Court observed in United States v. Philadelphia 
ff^onal Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 363, the "live and let live" policy of 
/ *
m s
 i n a concentrated market is an implicit recognition that their 
terests are best served by renouncing vigorous competition. 

^hich it clearly dominates. Permitting Applicant to open a new bank 
in the projected service area not only imposes a hardship upon other 
small banks in the area which could profitably use additional time in 
^hich to become more effective competitors, but to the public at large 
^ho would benefit from the advantages a more competitive banking en-
vironment would offer.

September 28, "1972 
Mr. Martin W . Bergin, Executive Secretary 
Retirement System of the Federal Reserve Banks 
33 Liberty Street 
New York," New York 10045 
Dear Mr. Bergin: 
The Board of Governors has approved the amendment of 
Group Life and Survivor Income Insurance Policy no. 22271-01 
issued by Connecticut General Life Insurance Company to the 
Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, as proposed in a memorandum from your office 
dated August 23, 1972. This proposed amendment, which is t.o 
become effective October 1, 1972, would change the definition of 
a
 Class A Survivor appearing in section 9, page 8, so as to 
eliminate the present distinction in eligibility for survivor 
income benefits based on a dependency test that has been con-
strued as inconsistent with a provision in Guidelines on 
Discrimination Because of Sex, issued by the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission on April 5, 1972. The Board also approves 
the deletion from the policy of clause (3) under "Survivor Income 
Benefits" in section 11, page 9, which provides for the payment 
such income benefits to a Class A survivor who is a surviving 
husband until he ceases to be disabled. 
In approving the amendments to this policy, which it 
i s
 understood are solely Jior the purpose of eliminating the 
Present distinction in eligibility for survivorship benefits 
because of the sex of a deceased employee, the Board also notes 
Without objection the increased premium charge of $138,735 for 
the expanded coverage for the period October 1 - December 31, 1972. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

Gentlemen; 
As requested in your letters of June 27, 1972 and September 1, 
the Board of Governors grants consent; pursuant to the provisions 
c f
 Section 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, 
and Section 225.4(f) of Regulation Y. for your Corporation, ("FPC"), to 
Purchase and hold 41.6 per cent of the shares and Series A Capital Notes 
F.IoB.I,, Holding Company Limited, ("FIBI") , a company organized under 
laws of Israel, at a cost of approximately $16,184,000, provided the 
shaves and capital notes are acquired within one year from the date of 
^•ts letter. The Board also grants consent for FPC to hold indirectly 
through FIBI; 
(1) all of the shares of First International Bank of 
^Tael Limited, ("Israeli Bank"); (2) all of the shares of Mortgage and 
Savings Bank, Israel; and (3) 33 per cent of the shares of Koritz and 
Uc
*iler, Ltd. , Tel Aviv, Israel. 
As subsidiaries of a bank holding company under Sec-
-i-on 4(c) (13) , FIBI and its subsidiaries shall confine their activities 
0
 international or foreign banking and other international or foreign 
antia1 operations. In addition, FIBI and its subsidiaries will fur-
the Board with such reports regarding their activities as the 
°a.cd may require from time to time, 
. 
You have requested consent for FIBI to engage, directly or 
I^ifectly, in the business of underwriting or dealing in securities, 
board's consent to such activities is conditioned upon your Cor-
R a t i o n ' s obtaining the prior consent of the Board for the continued 
Riding of shares of FIBI should FIBI, directly or indirectly, acquire 
of individual issuers costing in excess of $500,000 or repre-
^ n g 
25 per cent of the voting shares of any company, except in the 
of under-writing operations covered by firm commitments from sub-
Orwriters or other purchasers. With respect to trading in securi-

Act, the Board's consent is further conditioned on the fact that FIBI, 
directly or indirectly, v?i11 acquire such shares only as dealer or 
underwriter, maintain a size and turnover of inventory that is reasonable 
in relation to demand, and dispose of such shares within a reasonable time. 
In this connection, shares acquired as a dealer need not be 
Sported under Section 225.4(f)(4) of Regulation Y. However, they are to 
b
e reported as a separate class, together with the date of acquisition, 
°n any Call Report of Condition or similar report requested by the Board. 
It is the preliminary ruling of the Board that the restrictions 
°f paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act would 
G
pply to loans by affiliated United States banks to Israeli Bank and the 
above consents are granted on the condition that, until a final ruling 
is made, credit extensions by First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company 
r
-° Israeli Bank will conform to the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 
o f
 Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
As requested in your letter of September 8, 1972, the Board of 
Governors also grants consent for FPC to acquire all of the shares of a 
Del aware Corporation, ("DC"). This consent is granted on the condition 
that DC shall function solely to hold the shares and capital notes of 
i
?
lBI and to raise funds abroad to finance the purchase of such shares 
a
nd capital notes. 
In connection with its consideration of this application, the 
Board reviewed the capital structure of First Pennsylvania Banking and 
Trust Company and communicated with you concerning the need for the 
investment of additional equity capital in such bank. The Board has 
approved the application with the understanding that you will cause 
additional funds of not less than $30 million to be invested in such bank 
^ the form of equity capital by about mid-year 1973. 
The foregoing consents are given on condition that the invest-
ments will be made within the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint ("VFCR") 
Guidelines as they apply to First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company 
and i t s affiliates. The Board takes note of the substantial size of the 
investment in relation to the VFCR ceiling of the bank and its affiliates; 
al so notes the absence of ceiling leeway sufficient to accommodate 
t l l e
 foreign assets held on the most recent VFCR monthly reporting date 
P ^ s the full, or even the initial, investment. The Board understands 
tll
at Fpc intends that a reduction will be made in those foreign assets 
S u
*£icient to accommodate the new foreign investment under the Guideline

cei.li.ng or that the investment will be made by foreign branches or 
affiliates of First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company with funds 
obtained outsi.de the United States or that a combination of these or 
other steps will be taken consistent with the Guidelines.

BANCO DI ROMA S.P.A, 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
Banco di Roma S.p.A., Rome, Italy, has applied for the 
B
°ard's approval under 5 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act 
U.S.C, 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding company through 
acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' 
^alifying shares) of Banco di Roma (Chicago), Chicago, Illinois 
( ' B a n k " ) , a proposed new b a n k . 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
a
°cordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
comments received in the light of the factors set forth in 5 3(c) 
°f the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant, majority owned by the Italian government, is the 
fc
Hrd largest commercial bank In Italy, operates approximately 300 
br 
anches and agencies, and has worldwide deposits of $7.3 billion. 
applicant presently operates an agency office in San Francisco, 
C a
lifornia, a n d representative offices in New York, New York, and 
C
hicag 0, Illinois. Applicant also owns a one-third interest in 
Ei 
Copartners Securities Corporation, New York, New York, which en-
^
a
§
G
s in a general securities business. 
Acquisition of Bank x;ould enable Applicant to convert the 
C i t i e s of its representative office into full scale banking opera-
tic

It is contemplated that while Bank will offer general banking

services, particularly those relating to Italy and Western Europe 
in general. Consummation of the proposal would have no adverse 
effects on existing or potential competition and may increase com-
petition to some degree in the market of international banking 
services. 
The financial and managerial resources and prospects of 
Applicant and Bank are satisfactory and consistent with approval of 
t h e
 application. At the present time, although approximately 30 per 
C Q
n t of United States trade with Italy originates in the Midwest, 
a
Pproximately 90 per cent of the payment settlements for this trade 
a r e
 channeled through New York banks. Bank could help alleviate the 
Problems this causes in delays in payment and consequent loss of 
Mailable funds. Considerations relating to the convenience and needs 
the communities to be served thus lend weight toward approval of 
t h e
 application. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed trans-
ition is in the public interest and should be approved. 
In connection with the present application, Applicant also 
a
Pplied for the Board's permission to retain its one-third interest 
i n
 EuroPartners Securities Corporation. That application was separately 
considered by the Board under § 4(c)(9) of the Act and is the subject of 
a
 denial Order issued by the Board today. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
t h e
 reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consum-
mated ( a ) before the thirtieth calendar day follov;ing the effective

BANCO DI ROMA 
Order Disapproving Retention of Investment in EuroPartners 
Securities Corporation 
Banco di Roma, Rome, Italy, has applied for the Board
1
s 
a
Pproval under section 4(c)(9) of the Bank Holding Company Act to 
r e
tain 33-1/3 per cent of the voting shares of EuroPartners Securities 
Corporation ("EuroPartners"), New York City, if Banco di Roma becomes 
a
 hank holding company. 
Banco di Roma has received the Board's permission to become 
a
 hank holding company through the acquisition of all of the voting 
s t
ock (less directors' qualifying shares) of a proposed new bank in 
Chicago, Illinois, to be named Banco di Roma (Chicago), If the pro-
Posed acquisition is consummated, Banco di Roma will be a foreign 
b a
nk holding company within the meaning of § 225.4(g)(1)(iii) of 
R e
gulation Y. 
EuroPartners was originally incorporated under the name of 
Credit Lyonnais Corporation by Credit Lyonnais, a French bank, in 1968. 
^
a
ter the name of the corporation was changed, and Banco di Roma and 
C
°ttmerzbank, a German bank, each acquired 33-1/3 per cent of the voting 
s b a
r e s of the corporation. EuroPartners was originally formed and 
U r a t e s primarily to facilitate investments in the United States by 
t b G
 European clients of its three European bank shareholders. 
The general plan and character of the business of Euro-
^rtners is to engage in and conduct as a broker-dealer a securities 

2 "6 8
3 
business, including brokerage activities, underwriting, and invest-
ment banking and investment advisory services. The corporation is 
a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., 
the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange, and the Mid-
west stock Exchange. 
In the calendar year 1971, EuroPartners did a substantial 
underwriting business, accounting for approximately 15 per cent of 
its gross income. Almost 90 per cent of gross income from this source 
ttas derived from United States customers. The predominant activity of 
EuroPartners was brokerage business. Commission income from this source 
accounted for approximately two-thirds of its gross income. Histor-
ically, foreign customer accounts have generated more than 90 per cent 
its gross brokerage commissions on all customer accounts. 
EuroPartners offers financial advice and services to 
E u r o p e a n and other foreign clients interested in obtaining financing 
in the United States or in effecting in the United States direct in-
V e
ctments, acquisitions, joint ventures, mergers and other corporate 
transactions. It offers similar services with respect to foreign 
markets to American and Canadian companies having interests abroad. 
Section 4(c)(9) of the Act provides that the prohibitions of 
Action 4 shall not apply to the investments or activities of foreign 
b
ank holding companies that conduct the greater part of their business 
°utside the United States, if the Board by regulation or order deter-
mines that, under the circumstances and subject to the conditions set 
f o r
t h in the regulation or order, the exemption would not be substantially

®t variance with the purposes of the Act and would be in the public 
interest. Banco di Roma has applied for a special exemption for its 
investment in EuroPartners under 5 225.4(g)(3) of Regulation Y, con-
tending that retention of such investment would be consistent with the 
Purposes of the Act and would be in the public interest. Its princi-
pal arguments are that (1) a very substantial proportion (73%) of 
EuroPartners
1
 gross income is derived from foreign sources, (2) the 
Possibility of abuses associated uith common ownership of a commercial 
b
ank and an investment banking firm could be eliminated by specific 
undertakings of Banco di Roma to insulate the activities of Banco di 
Koma (Chicago) from those of EuroPartners, (3) the operations of 
EuroPartners uould have a beneficial impact on the balance of payments 
o f
 the United States by facilitating foreign investment in this coun-
t y , and (4) it uould be inequitable to deny an exemption in circum-
stances that uould force Banco di Roma to choose betueen a securities 
It does not appear that EuroPartners is or x;ill be engaged in the 
United States exclusively in activities incidental to its international 
foreign business, nor has Banco di Roma given any assurances to the 
B
<>ard concerning the future scope-uhethcr foreign or domestic oriented— 
the operations of EuroPartners. Since the underwriting business of 
EuroPartners predominantly relates to United States customers, an exemp-
tion under 55 225.4(g)(2)(ill) or (iv) of Regulation Y uould not seem 
a
Ppropriate 
and Banco di Roma has not applied under those sections. 
T b
e Board expresses no opinion on the question whether a company engaged 
the United States exclusively in brokerage business for primarily 
f
°reign customers could qualify for exemption under either of these 
sections.

operation in New York and a banking operation in Illinois, when other 
foreign banks are permitted to have both a securities operation and a 
2/ 
banking operation in Neu York, 
Banco di Roma's investment in Europartners is an investment 
that would not be permissible to a domestic bank holding company. The 
Board has consistently applied the policies of the Glass-Steagall Act 
t o
 all bank holding companies registered under the Bank Holding Company 
A c
t irrespective of whether they have subsidiaries that are member banks. 
(See, e.g., 12 CFR 225.125 and 12 CFPv 225.126.) 
In enacting the Glass-
S
teagall Act, Congress indicated that affiliations of commercial banks 
ar
*d securities companies give rise to potential conflicts of interests 
a n d
 unsound banking practices. 
The Board is not persuaded that the public benefits that are 
a
U e g c d for the affiliation of a foreign bank holding company and a 
securities company would outweigh the possible adverse effects with 
uhich Congress was concerned in the enactment of the Glass-Steagall 
A c t
« 
An affiliation with a securities company would give a foreign 
b a n
k holding company an unfair competitive advantage over a domestic 
b a
M t holding company in that a foreign bank holding company would be 
I ^ T h e fourth argument refers to branch operations of foreign banks 
Neu York. Foreign banks are permitted to establish branches under 
York State law and are not so permitted under Illinois law. A 
jj-anch of a foreign bank in the United States would not be a "bank" as 
h a t
 term is defined in § 2(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act, and such 
9
. branch may therefore be established xjherever permitted by State law 
7l
thout the Board's prior approval under the Act.

able to offer its customers an alternative means of obtaining financing 
to credit facilities, namely, underwriting facilities. While there is 
no reason to doubt the sincerity of the Banco di Roma's plan to in-
sulate the operations of its subsidiary bank in Chicago from the 
operations of EuroPartners, adoption of such a plan as a general 
guideline for conforming the operations of any bank holding company 
to the policies of the Glass-Steagall Act would pose very difficult 
supervision problems for the Board which, in the Board's judgment, 
If 
render such a plan unworkable. 
Moreover, the Board is of the opinion that differences in 
State laws on bank branching should not be permitted to override the 
Policies of the Bank Holding Company Act regarding the separation of 
b
anking from commerce. The Banco di Roma is at no disadvantage to 
a n
V other bank in its inability to obtain a branch in Illinois, since 
Illinois law does not authorize branching by any bank. Were the 
^°ard to adopt a policy of permitting exceptions to the prohibitions 
section 4 in the interest of compensating for differences in State 
the application of section 4 would be seriously compromised. 
3/^ A comprehensive plan would need to be more extensive than that 
Proposed by Applicant and would be unduly complex to administer. For 
^ample, Applicant's plan would not deal with several potential con-
^ict of interests problems: 
(1) a bank's loans to finance the opera-
ions of corporate investment banking clients of its securities affiliate, 
J
2
) a bank's loans to finance the purchase of securities from or through 
l
to securities affiliate, (3) promotional activities of a bank on behalf 
0 i :
 its securities affiliate, and (4) reciprocal lending between banks and 
G
ach other's securities affiliates. 

2637 
Based on the foregoing and other considerations reflected 
in the record, the Board hereby denies the request of Banco di Roma 
for an exemption under 5 4(c)(9) of the Bank Holding Company Act for 
its investment in EuroPartners. Under S 4(a)(2) of the Act, if Banco 
di Roma consummates the acquisition of its proposed subsidiary bank 
in Chicago, it will be required by law to divest its ownership of 
shares of EuroPartners within two years after the date as of which 
it becomes a bank holding company.

Gentlemen: 
In connection with its recent approval of your application 
for the Board's permission to acquire a subsidiary bank in Chicago. 
Illinois, the Board of Governors considered the effect on such ap-
plication of the fact that: a financial public corporation owned by 
the Italian Government and affiliated with your bank, the Industrial 
Reconstruction Institute ("1RI"), had nonbanking subsidiaries operat-
ing in the United States. The Board determined that it could bast 
assure, that the relationship between the Chicago bank and such non- * 
banking subsidiaries of IRI is compatible with the purposes of the 
Sank Holding Company Act by keeping itself informed of the i d e n M t y 
such nonbanking operations in the United States and by observing 
that the operation cf the Chicago bank is conducted independently 
any controlling influence that might be exercised by IRI, directly 
indirectly, for the benefit of its nonbanking subsidiaries having 
derations in i.he l)n:i tad States. 
Your cooperation is therefore requested in furnishing to 
the- Board annually, at the time of IRl's annual report, accurate 
a
h d complete information on the identity of subsidiaries of IRI 
haviiKj operations in the United States and the location of such 
operations. 
'i'he board's present information on this subject is based

Order Denying Request for Reconsideration 
The Trust Company of New Jersey, Jersey City, New Jersey, 
has requested reconsideration of the Order of the Board of Governors 
dated July 27, 1972, whereby the Board denied the application of The 
T
^ust Company of New Jersey for prior approval of the merger of that

Oil Company of Texas, New York, New York. 
Pursuant to § 262.3(f)(6) of the Board's Rules, Applicant 
r e
quests reconsideration of its original proposal. The Board finds 
that the request for reconsideration does not present relevant facts 
that, for good cause shown,were not previously presented to the Board 
that it does not otherwise appear that reconsideration would be 
a
Ppropriate in the public interest. Accordingly, the Board concludes 
that the Request for Reconsideration is hereby denied.

Dear M r . Miller: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is 
prepared to retain you as special counsel for the Board in an 
administrative proceeding soon to be commenced by the Board for 
removal of a director of a national bank in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
More particularly, the Board intends in the near future, 
pursuant to sections 202(e)(2) and (7) of the Financial Institutions 
Supervisory Act of 1956 (12 U.-S.C. 1818(e)(2) and (7)), to serve 
upon the director involved a written notice of its intention to 
remove him from office and to prohibit him from further participation 
in any manner iri the conduct of the affairs of the bank, together 
with a statement of charges upon which this action is predicated. 
Unless the director consents to removal--which is considered 
unlikelv~~a hearing, as provided for in the Act, will be held in 
New Orleans. 
It is understood that you will perform the work of special 
counsel in this proceeding on your own responsibility but with con-
sultation with the Board and the Board's General Counsel, and under 
the General Counsel's supervision. Inasmuch as the Comptroller of 
the Currency initiated this proceeding by certifying to the Board the 
facts developed by his investigation, his office is familiar with the 
pertinent facts and circumstances, and members of his staff will be 
kept informed and will be available to assist and consult with you as 
the matter progresses. 

Herbert John Miller, Esq. 
2 "6 35 
You vill not be considered an employee or officer of the 
Board, and your relationship to the Board will be one of contract 
rather than appointment. Your compensation will be on a per hour 
basis according to the time devoted to this matter. It is expected, 
of course, that you as a member of the firm of Miller, Cassidy, 
Larroca & Lowin will continue to maintain your customary law offices 
and accept and perform other legal work, as usual. 
It is understood that the Board will pay you at the rate 
of $100 per hour for work performed by you on this matter, plus $50 
per hour for work performed by juniors and assistants in your firm, 
based on statements submitted to the Board monthly. You will also 
be reimbursed for actual transportation expenses incurred in neces-
sary travel away from Washington while working on this matter, and 
a per diem in lieu of subsistence not to exceed $11 plus actual cost 
of room, on a basis equivalent t:o that provided in the Board's Travel 
Regulations (copy enclosed). 
Since at this date it does not appear either necessary or 
practical for the Board to set a maximum fee that will be paid in 
this matter no such ceiling has been set. However, it may be neces-
sary in the light of future developments to make provision for a 
ceiling on the total fee. Should that necessity arise, it is anti-
cipated that the matter will be settled by mutual agreement. 
It is further understood that the arrangement is subject 
to termination by the Board at any time and for any reason upon 30-
day s notice in writing to you. 
If the arrangement as described herein is agreeable to 
you, we will appreciate your written confirmation as promptly as 
possible, We trust that the arrangement will prove to be mutually 
satisfactory in every way. 
Very truly yours.
