Bank of the Commonwealth matter. Governor Robertson reported 
that the Commissioner of Banking for the State of Michigan had requested 
P
e
rmission to use certain items of Federal Reserve correspondence in 
connection 
with his intended denial of two branch applications by Bank 
the Commonwealth, Detroit, Michigan. These included a letter 
W r
itten to Bank of the Commonwealth by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
PL . 
icago regarding the April 1967 examination of the bank and a letter 
W r
itten by the Board to Bank of the Commonwealth in December 1967

r a n
dum of June 19, 1968, Governor Mitchell recommended that the Board

Committee for the Fundamental Reappraisal of the Discount Mechanism in 
substantially the form sent to the Board under date of June 12. Dis-
tribution would be made to groups of bankers as contacted by Governor 
Mitchell and the staff; to Professor Lester V. Chandler, academic 
consultant to the discount study, and such other academicians as he 
chose to contact and solicit comments from on behalf of the Board; to 
the press; and to any other individuals or institutions expressing an 
interest in receiving the report. 
Governor Mitchell also suggested that the report by Bernard 
Shullj research director of the discount study, be made available as 
s
oon as possible to the groups mentioned, since it gave a general over-
view and integration of the research undertaken and served to buttress 
positions taken in the report. It was also intended that individual 
research papers, especially those with particular relevance to the 
specific proposals, be made available as they were cleared by the 
discount study editorial committee. 
The memorandum noted that as a result of some confusion already 
a
Pparent among members of the Federal Advisory Council and Reserve Bank 
boards of directors in interpreting the technically-oriented report, 
staff was preparing a somewhat briefer and less technical descrip-
tion of the proposed redesign of the discount mechanism, written in 
Press release style, that could accompany the report when it was 
r e
leased. A draft of this document would be presented to the Board 
f
°r consideration.

Governor Robertson expressed the view that it would be espe-
cially desirable to obtain comments from small banks, and Governor 
Mitchell responded that the Reserve Banks would be instructed to set 
U
P meetings with such banks. Governor Robertson then suggested that 
Mr. Shull's report be distributed only upon request, and Governor 
Mitchell agreed that the paper should not be sent to people who would 
not be interested in as much detail as it contained. However, he 
thought it should be made known that the paper was available. 
Governor Brimmer said he thought it would be helpful to send 
the press release and the discount study report to the American Bankers 
Association and to all of the State bankers associations. He had dis-
covered a great deal of interest in the study among members of State 
bankers associations, including nonmember bankers, and he would encour-
a
ge the State associations to promote discussion among their membership. 
Question was raised whether it would not be best to let the Reserve 
Banks handle distribution to the State associations, and Governor 
tinnier agreed to that procedure, so long as such distribution was a 
d e
finite part of the program. 
Governor Brimmer then posed a series of questions regarding 
t
he composition of the list of academicians who would receive the 
Report. Mr. Holland brought out that the list had been made up by 
Professor Chandler, who had selected a group thought to be represen-
tative. Governor Brimmer expressed the view that the most helpful 

2310 
6/20/68 
-5-
comments would not necessarily come from the most prominent people in 
the academic profession but from those who were deeply interested in 
the problem of the discount window. He suggested that consideration 
be given to using the list compiled by the American Economic Associa-
tion of those who had classified themselves as specializing in the 
field of money and banking. Governor Mitchell observed that persons 
w
ith knowledge and interest might also be reached by publishing the 
r
eport in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. 
Further discussion resulted in general approval of the proce-
dures suggested by Governor Mitchell. A copy of the letter subse-
quently sent to the Federal Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 3. 
Operations subsidiaries. On May 25, 1967, the Board considered 
draft legislation regarding operations subsidiaries of banks that the 
Legal Division had submitted with a memorandum dated March 3, 1967. 
Discussion included the suggestion that further consideration would be 
facilitated if the staff broke the general issue down into several com-
partments, and subsequently Mr. Hexter had suggested a grouping of 
several of the questions involved that would seem appropriate for a 
first stage of study. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 13, 1968, 
from the Legal Division clarifying the scope of the draft legislation, 
decent discussions and news items suggested that banks wanted to use 
subsidiary corporations (1) to make mortgage loans at places where they 

2311 
6/20/68 
-6-
could not lawfully establish a branch for that purpose, and (2) to 
engage in a business that the bank might not perform itself (such as 
investing in equity securities). Such subsidiary corporations were 
beyond the scope of the draft legislation. To authorize them would 
effectively, although indirectly, expand the substantive powers of 
banks, whereas the legislative proposal was designed to authorize a 
bank to establish or acquire only subsidiaries that were to engage 
solely in activities that the parent bank was authorized to engage in 
directly. 
It would not authorize a bank, for example, to acquire a 
community development corporation that was to invest in equities, make 
S e
cond mortgage loans, or engage in other kinds of business that were 
n
°t within the powers of the parent bank. 
The draft legislation also would limit the locations at which 
a
 bank's subsidiary corporations could establish and maintain offices. 
This would be accomplished by amending section 5155 of the Revised 
Statutes to state explicitly that any place of business of an opera-
tions subsidiary would be considered a place of business of the parent 
bank. 
The draft legislation was based on the assumptions that (1) the 
Board wanted to adhere to its 1966 interpretation that the so-called 
stock-purchase prohibition" of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes 
forbids the establishment of operations subsidiaries despite the con-
trary interpretation by the Comptroller of the Currency, and (2) even 
i 

> '» % o 
6/20/68 
-7-
if the Board no longer adhered to its 1966 interpretation, it consid-
ered that the authority of member banks to establish such subsidiaries 
should be subject to some or all of the controls provided for in the 
draft bill. 
At today's meeting Mr. Hexter commented on the sub-topics he 
had suggested be given precedence. The first was whether operations 
subsidiary legislation was desirable; in other words, whether the 
apparently limited prospective benefits would outweigh the complexi-
ties and difficulties of administering such a law. The Reserve Banks 
had been requested to comment on this question, along with other issues 
involved, and a majority had agreed with the Board's staff that, on 
balance, some sort of authorization for operations subsidiaries was 
desirable. 
The second question, Mr. Hexter continued, was whether the 
Proposed legislation should be in the nature of a general statutory 
a u t
horization for the use of operations subsidiaries, with regulatory 
a u
thority to limit them, or whether a supervisory authority should be 
Siven power to permit the establishment of operations subsidiaries and 
a l s
o power to regulate the conduct of their business. The staff had 
c
°ncluded that the latter was the preferable approach. 
The next question was whether rules for operating subsidiaries 
should be the same for national and State member banks. It was probably 
n
°t possible to achieve complete uniformity, but the Reserve Banks had 

2313 
6/20/68 
-8-
a
greed that as far as possible, from the Federal point of view, uniform 
rules for national and State member banks should be achieved. 
The final question in the group, Mr. Hexter said, was whether 
regulatory authority should be vested in the Board or the Comptroller 
°f the Currency. Arguments could be made on either side, and also for 
joint regulation. When the Board considered the latter possibility a 
year ago, there had been some sentiment against it; on the other hand 
h
e did not believe there had been a firm majority opinion in favor of 
Placing the regulatory power solely with either the Board or the 
Comptroller. 
Governor Mitchell stated that the position he believed correct 
W a
s the one he had taken in 1964 regarding the operation of offices of 
a
 mortgage company by Mercantile Trust Company, St. Louis, Missouri. 
(The Board had informed Mercantile Trust Company that operation of the 
Mortgage company's offices would violate section 9 of the Federal 
Reserve Act and section 5155 of the Revised Statutes, relating to bank 
^ranches, since it appeared that the offices, under control of Mercan-
tile Trust, would be making loans. Mercantile Trust then sought to 
c
°ntinue to operate the offices under an arrangement whereby loans 
w
°uld be made only from the head office of the bank.) 
Governor 
Mitchell read from his comments as recorded in the minutes of the 
m e
eting on October 6, 1964, as follows: 

s a i l 
6/20/68 
-9-
"Governor Mitchell said that while he was not attempt-
ing to judge the validity of the legal arguments in this 
case, it seemed as though one could go in the direction of 
approving the practice. This caused him to wonder whether 
the posture suggested by the Legal Division was too conser-
vative. Large banks today had representatives in various 
parts of the United States that handled loan transactions 
in a manner similar to that being questioned; bank repre-
sentatives solicited, and completed the terms of a loan, 
except that final approval was obtained from the head 
office. This practice was convenient for the customer 
and everyone concerned, and this type of transaction went 
unchallenged. A loan so transacted was equivalent, in his 
view, to the practice now engaged in by Mercantile Trust 
through its mortgage company subsidiary. As he saw it, 
the Board would be challenging a specialized service that 
conceivably was better for a community from the competitive 
standpoint than would be the operation of a branch banking 
office." 
There appeared to be several specific issues before the Board 
today, Governor Mitchell continued. The first was the question of the 
m a
Jor areas in which operations subsidiaries should be permitted. He 
believed there were two areas that far outweighed others in importance: 
°
n
e was the making of mortgage loans--and this was the point on which 
ism of the Federal Reserve had been most severe; the other was 
the operation of mutual funds. It seemed to him that in these two 
functions operations subsidiaries should be permitted, within a general 
r u
le that if a bank could do things directly it should be permitted to 
them through subsidiaries. 
Governor Mitchell then reverted to the Mercantile Trust Company 
C a s
e and said he thought the Board's position must be reversed if the 
Board was to have due regard for the degree of economic integration 
h' 
... 
. 
. 

/ O o i 
6/20/68 
-10-
that had taken place. Since activities such as mail solicitation of 
deposits and loans took place without criticism, he saw no reason why 
limited function offices should be prohibited. On the other hand, if 
a
n office provided full-scale services, it should be subjected to the 
statutory restrictions regarding branches. 
Governor Mitchell observed that the draft legislation contem-
plated that regulations would be issued to define what could and could 
not be done through operations subsidiaries. He felt strongly that 
there was not much chance of enactment of a statute that would leave 
such definitions to regulation. The Board's position had been repre-
sented as very strict and opposed to extension of banking powers even 
light of changes that had occurred in the economic environment. His 
own view was that it would be better to have liberalizing legislation 
that would state specifically what functions operations subsidiaries 
could perform. 
His final question, Governor Mitchell said, was whether there 
m
ight not be some way of interpreting existing legislation so as to 
a
lter the Board's present policy stance without flouting the law. 
Perhaps the Board's position was the one with the most solid base 
from a legal standpoint, but there might be other positions that would 
Permit a shift in policy and still would be legally defensible. If so, 
he would be in favor of altering the present position. 
Governor Maisel said he had felt extremely uncomfortable during 
his entire service on the Board with respect to the Board's position on 

6/20/68 
-11-
°Perations subsidiaries. It seemed to him that the Board had strained 
a
t gnats, had made inconsistent decisions in individual cases, and had 
required illogical organization on the part of banks to satisfy what 
he considered not very valid legal points. The present stance of the 
matter was very embarrassing. 
The solution he would propose, Governor Maisel continued, was 
that since State member banks, under the provisions of section 9 of 
the Federal Reserve Act, could establish branches to the same extent 
a s
 national banks, the Board simply accept the Comptroller's interpre-
tation on operations subsidiaries and let him prescribe restrictions. 
It seemed to him that this would be the most logical way of dealing 
w i t
h the problem. He had at first thought legislation would be 
r e
quired, but now he did not think it would. Under the Comptroller's 
r u
ling, many operations subsidiaries had been in existence for quite 
a
 while, and the Board could avoid the problems arising from dual 
interpretation by leaving the matter to the authority that had respon-
sibility for the greater number of member banks. If the Board could 
n
°t see its way clear to accept this solution, his next preference 
w
°uld be to seek liberalizing legislation phrased in specific terms. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he did not believe the Board 
s
hould abdicate its responsibility for interpretation of the statute, 
arriving at his own position, he said, he had started with the fact 
a t
 the economic environment in which the banking business operated 

«r"> " » ^ 
(CO.L < 
6/20/68 
-12-
today was quite different from 30-odd years ago. He thought it was 
highly desirable that banks have greater latitude for conducting their 
business on an efficient basis in the present-day environment, and 
therefore he would like to see legislation enacted. However, he did 
n
°t feel that the legislative proposal as drafted met that objective; 
i-nstead, it seemed to focus on trying to resolve the conflict between 
the Board and the Comptroller. Although he was willing to have legis-
lation written in terms of specifics, Governor Brimmer said, he was 
somewhat apprehensive that too much restriction might result. 
Some 
flexibility would be desirable. At the same time, however, he would 
n
°t want to overlook the need for appropriate safeguards, since banks 
W e
r e handling other peoples' money, and therefore the supervisory 
authorities should be given some responsibility. 
Governor Sherrill said he believed there was an urgent need to 
move forward in this area. The competitive environment required that 
banks have enough room to maintain their position; there had been a 
number of forces in recent years pressing on the traditional areas of 
c
°inmercial banks and making the conduct of their business more diffi-
C u
l t . He thought the proposal to permit operations subsidiaries was 
a
 logical and useful way in which to provide help. His preference 
w
°uld be to provide such help through interpretation, but if that was 
n
°t feasible he would favor legislation along the lines Governor Brimmer 
ha
<* described.

Governor Robertson observed that the banking business had to 
adj ust to continuing changes in the economy. Thus, if specific legis-
lation had been enacted a few years ago, it would not be adequate today. 
He did not believe it was justifiable to adopt the approach Governor 
Maisel had suggested, because the Board had responsibility for inter-
preting the statute so far as State member banks were concerned. Nor 
did he think the Board could interpret the statute in such a way as to 
Permit State member banks to have operations subsidiaries. 
Therefore, 
he thought legislation was necessary, and he would recommend that the 
Board move forward fast in asking for legislation. 
Governor Robertson recalled that he had objected to joint 
regulatory authority last year, but said he had now come around to 
thinking that that would be best. He believed it could be made to work. 
The fact that the banking industry was aroused suggested that it would 
hack a legislative proposal now more than it had been willing to before. 
I
11
 summary, he would proceed promptly to submit a legislative proposal 
S u
bstant ially along the lines suggested by the Legal Division, but in 
s
°mewhat broader terms. 
Chairman Martin expressed the view that it would be desirable 
to advocate legislation, and in the broadest possible terms. He was 
c
oncerned about the conflicting interpretations and wished it were 
Possible to bring the question to a court test. The competitive 
inequality among classes of banks presented a real problem. The 

' 3 1 9 
6/20/68 
-14-
Problem would be solved if all Federal bank supervision were vested in 
one agency, as Governor Robertson had recommended, but little progress 
a
PParently was being made in that direction. He believed that as a 
matter of posture the Board should advocate legislation, but he doubted 
that such a legislative proposal would be adopted in the near future. 
After some discussion of difficulties that might be involved 
in obtaining an opinion from the courts, Governor Maisel said the form 
ruling he believed would be most helpful would be one to the effect 
that since the Comptroller of the Currency had the responsibility to 
ad
niinister the law, which on this point was written in terms of what 
n a
tional banks could do, it followed that State member banks could do 
the same as national banks. 
Mr. Hexter observed that in general the courts took the view 
4.1 
a t
 the task of a supervisory agency was to enforce the law as reason-
a
hly as it could. On the matter of revenue bonds, for example, the 
c
°urt held that the Board had the right to make its own interpretation, 
a n
d that the Board's view of the law was correct. It was questionable 
w
hether it would be appropriate for the Board to seek a court ruling 
a t
 it would be proper for it to follow the Comptroller's interpreta-
tion even though in the Board's judgment that interpretation was wrong. 
Governor Mitchell said that from a practical standpoint he did 
n
°t know how far it would be desirable for the Board to move toward 
a c c e
P t i n g the Comptroller's ruling. If that were the only alternative, 

6/20/68 
-15-
he might like to attempt it, but he was inclined to prefer the legis-
lative approach. Perhaps language could be written into the legislation 
to cover types of activities that might be considered appropriate in the 
future. Proposal by the Board of such a statute in the near future 
w
ould indicate to State member banks that were thinking of converting 
to national charters that the Board was changing its attitude. 
That 
measure of reassurance might be increased if the Board also began to 
take a less strict view of cases that came before it. 
He happened to believe, Governor Mitchell said, that tax advan-
tages were the main reason for conversions to national charters, but 
if the Board gave some explicit evidence that it was going to reverse 
the thrust of its policy with respect to operations subsidiaries, State 
member banks that were considering conversion for reasons related to 
the scope of their activities might well hold off to see what would 
happ e n # 
This suggestion was not a perfect solution, but he thought 
surrendering to the Comptroller's interpretation had hazards that 
should be avoided if possible. 
Chairman Martin agreed that over the longer run the Board 
m
ight regret the precedent that had been established. 
It seemed to 
^im that the Board should move rapidly to propose legislation, thus 
^ k i n g it clear that it was aware of competitive inequalities in this 
a r e
a and was trying to have them corrected. 
Governor Brimmer said he was troubled by the stress on the 
d a
nger to the dual banking system. His own concern was with promoting 

6/20/68 
-16-
the efficiency of the banking system rather than with trying simply to 
Preserve State-chartered banks. He thought the Board should resist 
the efforts of some banks to use the differences of interpretation 
between the Board and the Comptroller to promote rivalry between the 
agencies for the banks' benefit. He hoped the Board's presentation of 
the operations subsidiaries question to the public would rest on the 
e f
ficiency of the banking system. 
Governor Robertson expressed concurrence with that view. 
The 
P°int was that in the interest of efficiency of the banking system the 
Federal Government should not have different policies for national 
banks and for State member banks; the latter should not be prohibited, 
a t
 the Federal level, from doing things that national banks could do. 
Governor Maisel then turned to the question of placement of 
r e
gulatory authority. He thought the power should be given to one 
a
gency rather than exercised jointly, and he would just as soon give 
the authority to the Comptroller. 
In any event, he thought that dual 
r e s
Ponsibility would lead to difficulties. 
Governor Sherrill expressed the opposite view. Joint responsi-
bility had been used for some time in various areas, and while it had 
drawbacks it also had strong points. The legislation to be proposed 
w
°uld represent quite a change from the past, and its enactment might 
b
e
 made more difficult if it called for placing regulatory authority 
e n
t i r e l y with the Comptroller. 

6/20/68 
-17-
Governor Brimmer agreed with Governor Sherrill that a proposal 
to pla ce regulatory authority solely with the Comptroller would under-
cut much of what the Board was trying to accomplish. 
Governor Maisel observed that the Board prescribed various 
r e
gulations, including those with regard to interest rates and stock 
market credit, which were applicable not only to State member banks 
b u
t also to national banks. 
Mr. Hexter commented that the reverse situation was to be found 
w
ith respect to the Comptroller's Investment Securities Regulation, 
compliance with which was supervised by him for national banks and by 
the Federal Reserve for State member banks. 
Mr. Sanders then suggested that as a compromise it might be 
Proposed that the regulatory authority be given to the Comptroller 
subject to the concurrence of the Board, thus providing the Board with 
a v
eto power. Mr. Hexter remarked that still another alternative would 
to have the Board prescribe regulations subject to concurrence by 
Comptroller. Since all of the affected banks, both national and 
State, were members of the System, it might be more reasonable to have 
Board prescribe such regulations. 
Chairman Martin said it seemed to him that the draft legisla-
tion should be revised as rapidly as possible in light of the views 
L n a
t had been expressed. Although he believed Governor Mitchell was 
b a s
ically right in naming tax considerations as the main underlying 

r> » > r V 
6/20/68 
-18-
reason for many of the conversions to national charters, several con-
versions that were understood to be in prospect were likely to high-
light dissatisfaction with Federal Reserve supervision as a major issue. 
If the Board considered it desirable to allow the use of operations 
subsidiaries, he believed it should make that posture clear through 
Proposing legislation. Also, there might be cases coming before the 
Board i n which the interpretation made would suggest the Board's atti-
tude. He thought the idea of a single Federal bank supervisory agency 
had some merit, but it appeared that the likelihood of passage of such 
a
 measure in the foreseeable future was virtually nil, just as, in his 
°Pinion, there was no real chance of obtaining legislation on opera-
tions subsidiaries at this session of Congress. 
Governor Mitchell noted that an alternative to proposing legis-
lation would be to reverse the Board's outstanding interpretation. 
However, if it was thought that the posture of the Board would be 
better if it recommended legislation, at least the making of such a 
P
r
oposal would indicate the Board's attitude, and he thought the bank-
ing industry would join in the effort. 
There ensued further comments on the trend to conversion from 
S t a
t e to national charters, during which Governor Sherrill remarked 
cnat he agreed with Governor Brimmer's point that danger to the dual 
b a
n k i n g 
system should not be the motivation in recommending legisla-
tion. xt was not the Board's responsibility to preserve the dual

-19-
hanking system. Neither, however, was it the Board's responsibility 
to damage the dual banking system, and that charge seemed to be gather-
ing momentum. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
staff would revise the draft legislative proposal in the light of the 
v
iews that had been expressed, for the Board's further consideration. 
Community development corporation. Pursuant to the understand-
ing 
reached during earlier discussions, there had been distributed a 
memorandum dated June 13, 1968, from the Legal Division regarding the 
establishment of a community development corporation by The Citizens 
and Southern National Bank of Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, which was 
a
lso a registered bank holding company. The purpose of the plan was 
reportedly to effect slum improvement and to make loans to low-income 
minority groups for purchasing homes and establishing small businesses. 
The bank had invested $1 million in the stock of this subsidiary, and 
x t
 was understood that the Comptroller of the Currency had approved 
t h
e plan. 
The memorandum noted that the Board had consistently taken the 
Positio n that a bank that fell within the statutory definition of "bank 
holding 
company" was subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Com-
Pany Act, including the restrictions on acquisition of stock of non-
hanking corporations (section 4(a)(1)). Neither Citizens and Southern 
National Bank nor any other bank holding company had questioned that 

6/20/68 
-20-
position, and it was hardly conceivable that the courts would sustain 
a
 contention that banks that owned or controlled the stock of other 
banks were not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. Although a 
number of specific exemptions from the prohibition of section 4(a)(1) 
W e r e
 provided in the statute, none appeared to apply to Citizens and 
Southern's acquisition of the stock of the development corporation. 
By letter of May 24 the Atlanta Reserve Bank's Vice President 
in charge of examinations had been requested to present the Bank Hold-
l n
g Company Act question to officials of Citizens and Southern. His 
letter to the holding company was followed by a telephone call by the 
Reserve Bank's Counsel to Citizens and Southern making clear that the 
matter was still in the stage of preliminary exploration. Mr. O'Connell 
b
a
d also made that clear when the matter was mentioned during a meeting 
w
ith Citizens and Southern officials a few days ago with respect to 
C e
rtain other bank holding company problems. 
The memorandum brought out that it was not known what arguments 
the bank holding company would advance to support the legality of its 
a c
tion. Unless the Board directed otherwise, the staff contemplated 
f u 
rther discussions between Federal Reserve representatives and the 
bank holding company's officials, followed by a presentation to the 
Board of the views of the company and the recommendations of the 
Reserve Bank and the Board's staff. 
After comments by Mr. Hexter, Governor Brimmer reiterated the 
v
^ew he had expressed during earlier discussions that it was important

/Cti/O'b

that in conversations with Citizens and Southern the Board's represen-
tatives avoid giving an impression that the Board was convinced that 
the bank's action was outside the law and there was absolutely no way 
the bank to go forward with its objective; he feared the letter 
that had been written to the bank might have carried something of that 
tone. 
Further discussion brought out that although it appeared to 
the staff that the terms of the proposal, as they were presently under-
stood, were not consistent with the law, the bank holding company might 
he able to accomplish largely the same purpose by restructuring its 
Plan somewhat. 
Governor Mitchell observed that the Board sometimes helped 
People to find their way around such boulders in the stream and some-
times let them find their own way; he inquired whether the staff pro-
Posed to help Citizens and Southern find a feasible solution. 
Governor Brimmer commented, on this point, that in conversa-
tions with the staff he had heard various views, one of which was that 
Under some of the exceptions in the law there might be an acceptable 
W a
y for Citizens and Southern to achieve its purpose. Since several 
°ther somewhat similar proposals were likely to be presented to the 
Board soon, he would like to know whether the staff proposed simply to 
r e a
c t to the legality of the particular plan advanced or whether it 
Proposed to work with the bank holding company to adjust the arrange-
ment so that it rested on sound legal ground. 

* 
6/20/68

Mr. O'Connell said the staff would take every helpful step 
reasonably possible. He would not expect that a legally defensible 
Proposal would be drafted and handed to the bank holding company, but 
neither would the staff simply say that the one offered was not accept-
able. During a meeting that had been held with Citizens and Southern 
offi 
cials on other questions, discussion of the community development 
Plan had included references to several different frameworks, some of 
which 
clearly would violate the law. The staff had mentioned possible 
alternatives, and it was understood that Citizens and Southern would 
study them. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
staff would proceed along the lines indicated, having in mind the tenor 
°f Governor Brimmer's comments. 
Insurance agency subsidiaries. On May 6, 1968, the Board con-
sidered a question presented in a memorandum dated April 26 from the 
division of Examinations regarding three instances in which it had 
been discovered that State member banks were conducting insurance 
business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The money magnitudes 
rnvolved were small, and the existence of these "incorporated depart-
ments" of the banks did not in any way affect the banks' soundness. 
Yet there was a question whether or not the operations were in viola-
tion of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes, which, with some excep-
tions, forbids a State member bank to purchase corporate stock. An 

2328 
6/20/68 
-23-
attachment to the memorandum set forth details regarding the origin of 
the situat ions. The Division suggested two alternatives: 
the Board 
m
ight order the banks to dissolve the corporations or dispose of the 
stock, or it might conclude that the violations were inconsequential 
ar
*d that further efforts to correct them would conflict with sound 
administration. The Division recommended the latter course. The dis-
cussion at the May 6 meeting had disclosed a division of views among 
members of the Board present, and the question had been deferred for 
further consideration when additional members could be present. 
Governor Sherrill suggested that, pending the outcome of the 
Board's effort to obtain legislation permitting the use by banks of 
°Perations subsidiaries, discussed earlier at this meeting, no action 
be taken to require the three banks concerned to discontinue the pres-
e n t
 arrangements for conducting their insurance business. 
There was unanimous agreement with Governor Sherrill's sugges-
tion. 
Messrs. Noble, Plotkin, and Porter then withdrew and the 
following entered the room: 
Mr. Farrell, Director, Division of Bank Operations 
Mr. Rand, Systems Engineer, Division of Data Processing 
Mr. Bruce Smyth, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago (Chairman of the Presidents' Conference 
Subcommittee on Federal Reserve Inter-Bank Infor-
mation Systems)

Communications switch (Items 4 and 5). The Board had received 
a
 letter dated June 18, 1968, from President Heflin of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Richmond, in his capacity as Chairman of the Presi-
dents' Conference Committee on Inter-Bank Electronic Communications, 
regarding the studies of a subcommittee and related task forces look-
l n
8 toward the acquisition of an automated communications switch. The 
Committee agreed with the subcommittee's suggestion that the Federal 
Reserve begin negotiations with Marshall Communications, Santa Ana, 
California, for such an installation. It was expected that the nego-
tiations would produce a draft contract that would be submitted, for 
r e
view and final approval, to the Conference of Presidents and the 
Board not later than September. 
The proposed switch, together with present and separately 
ac
quire'd lines and terminal units, would comprise the communications 
system that would replace the teletype service presently used by the 
Reserve Banks and the Board. The proposed system offered the greatest 
a s
surance of uninterrupted reliable service, and the greatest ability 
to 
e
xpand, in modular and economic fashion, of any of the systems 
r e
viewed. 
its ability to connect effectively with and serve a wide 
r
ange Qf terminals and computers was substantially greater than that 
of any other switch proposed. It could provide the capability for 
direct on-line connection of Burroughs and IBM equipment presently in 
use by the Reserve Banks and the Board. The selection of this equipment

w a
s the result of exhaustive research and analysis that covered all 
offerings of the industry known to the Federal Reserve groups or their 
technical consultants, ARINC Research Corporation. 
The question of the ability of Marshall Communications to 
Perform had received considerable attention from the evaluation teams, 
since the company was relatively new and much smaller than other organi-
2 a
tions that had bid on this system. The Committee had concluded, and 
the Presidents' Conference agreed, that, while there was a risk of fail-
U r e
 to deliver an acceptable system, it was a reasonable one in view of 
the substantial operating advantages offered by the Marshall equipment. 
In summary, the communications switch proposed was believed to 
the most advanced offered by the industry at this time. Its acquisi-
tion would insure that the Federal Reserve System had a communications 
a
bility of maximum effectiveness well into the future and would facil-
itate the development of an improved money transfer system. It was 
hoped that the Board would review the proposal at an early date, in 
v
iew of the need to furnish a letter of intent to Marshall Communica-
n s
 so that negotiations could begin and unsuccessful vendors could 
b e notified. 
At Chairman Martin's invitation, Mr. Smyth commented on the 
t r
ucture and technical capabilities of the proposed communications 
S w
itch and on the scope of the investigation that had resulted in its 
Section. The several groups involved had been unanimous in preferring 

6/20/68 
-26-
the Marshall system. In the event of performance failure on the part 
°f Marshall, Federal Reserve losses would be limited to out-of-pocket 
expenses, such as consultants' fees, and to the loss of time in develop-
ment of the System's program, possibly a period of a year. The cost of 
a
 Marshall switch would be approximately $2.7 million, or about $500,000 
a
 year for a five-year lease with continuous maintenance. The price 
quoted by the vendor who might be second choice was approximately $6.3 
million and that of the third choice was $5.7 million. The substantial 
C o s t
 advantage offered by Marshall appeared to be largely attributable 
t o
 the economical design of its equipment. 
Governor Mitchell pointed out that today's presentation was 
lr
*tended merely to apprise the Board of developments. Formal action 
w
°uld not be requested until a contract was proposed in about two 
m
°nths. At present only a letter of intent, which would be issued by 
^ e Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was contemplated. 
. I.., 
Governor Brimmer observed that it was anticipated that the 
s
ystem would initially handle 128 circuits and could later be expanded 
t o
 handle 256. He was somewhat concerned about the ability of Marshall 
C°mmunications to survive and be available if and when it was desired 
t o
 expand the system. 
f 5 , 
Mr,, Smyth replied that the proposed system was almost fourth 
generation in concept, and expert opinion was that there was no reason 
Why 
i t would not work. Even if a large competitor should buy out 

6/20/68 
-27-
Marshall, it would probably make every effort to carry out the Federal 
Reserve commitment. He then described various precautions that would 
he taken to insure discharge of Marshall's obligation. 
Governor Sherrill remarked that the proposal represented a 
1113
jor move for the System as well as a major expenditure. 
In view of 
the wide spread of the bids, he would like to have comments on the 
c a
pabilities of the other systems offered. 
Messrs. Smyth and Barnes responded with comments on comparisons 
between the Marshall system and the others, reiterating that technical 
analysis had resulted in a conclusion that Marshall's favorable price 
resulted principally from a decided advantage in design. 
Governor Sherrill then said that in the absence of knowing 
m
°re about the Marshall system and its alternatives, he would have to 
accept on faith the Committee's view that the Marshall proposal offered 
t
he greatest advantage in performance as well as in price. Before the 
letter of intent was issued, he would like to make further inquiries 
the staff, which he thought they could answer in the course of an 
a f
ternoon. 
Governor Brimmer said he was willing to have the letter of 
intent issued; he had been sufficiently reassured regarding the ques-
tion he had raised. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the issuance of a letter 
o f
 intent was approved, provided the points Governor Sherrill wished

 raise with Messrs. Smyth and Barnes were resolved satisfactorily. 
A copy of the letter subsequently sent to President Heflin pursuant 
t o
 this action is attached as Item No. 4. A copy of the press release 
issued by the Board regarding the contract negotiations is attached as 
Item No. 5. 
Messrs. Shay, Rand, Smyth, and Barnes then withdrew from the 
meeting. 
Pooled time deposits (Item No. 6). In April 1968 Republic 
National Bank of Houston, Houston, Texas, requested an interpretation 
under Regulation Q, Payment of Interest on Deposits, as to whether it 
W a s
 Permissible for a member bank to pay interest at the rate of 
6 1/4 per cent per annum (the maximum rate permissible under the regu-

ion) on a $100,000 certificate of deposit with a maturity of at 
least 180 days issued to a group of 10 persons, each of whom would

formed solely for the purchase of the certificate.

Pursuant to discussion at the meeting on May 7, the Coordinating Com-
mittee on Bank Regulation was informed that the Board was prepared to 
adopt such an amendment, but was also willing to take the position 
administratively that the pooling of deposits in order to obtain a 
higher interest rate was contrary to the spirit of the regulation. 
The draft amendment was sent to the Federal Reserve Banks for comment. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 7, 1968, 
in which the Legal Division summarized the responses of the Reserve 
Banks, which were about evenly divided on the question whether or not 
the Board should adopt the proposed amendment. 
j 
The memorandum noted that throughout the Board's consideration 
this problem the Legal Division had recommended against the Board 
taking regulatory action to prevent pooling of funds to obtain a higher 
r
ate of interest. The Division now recommended that the matter be dis-
posed of by sending a letter to Republic National Bank stating that the 
Board regarded pooling of funds to obtain a higher rate of interest as 
c
°ntrary to the purpose for which higher rates on large deposits were 
P
e
*"mitted. A draft of such a letter was attached. 
It was suggested 
that, while the letter could be included in the Federal Reserve Loose-
^
e a
f Service, it should not be published as an interpretation because 
th 
6
 Possibility of pooling arrangements might thereby be highlighted. 
After comments by Mr. Sanders, Governor Robertson said the 
Co
°
r
dinating Committee had indicated that it would prefer not to take 

W U O J 
6/20/68 
-30-
a
 Position on the question at this time. He noted that Republic 
National Bank had now advertised its willingness to accept pooled 
deposits. The bank was aware that the regulation might be amended to 
Prohibit the practice. He described changes that he believed should 
°e made in the draft letter, and expressed the view that the bank 
w
°uld discontinue permitting the pooling of deposits if it received 
from the Board a letter in this revised form. 
Governor Brimmer inquired whether it would not be well to take 
n
°te of the fact that Republic National had been advertising for pooled 
deposits, and Governor Robertson agreed, suggesting that that be done 
person by Reserve Bank officials, who would have the Board's letter 
i r i
 hand. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that a distinction might 
drawn between pooling initiated by the participant depositors and 
Pooling organized by a bank among depositors who might be unknown to 
e a
ch other. The latter would be inconsistent with the regulation, in 
his view, whereas the former would not. Governor Robertson responded 
that Republic National's advertisement had apparently contemplated 
hank-organized pooling. Governor Sherrill inquired whether the adver-
tisement had called attention to the insurance hazard, and reply was 
m a
d e in the negative. 
Further discussion indicated that the Board was not disposed 
t o
 adopt an amendment to Regulation Q at this time, and unanimous

approval was given to a letter to Republic National Bank in the form 
attached as Item No. 6. 
General pay increase (Item No. 7). There had been distributed 
a
 memorandum from the Division of Personnel Administration dated June 17, 
1968, recommending that the Board approve a revision of its regular 
salary schedule corresponding to the new salary structure for employees 
under the Government's General Schedule, which structure reflected the 
S e
cond of the three-stage pay raises for Federal employees approved by 
Congress last year. The third phase was scheduled to become effective 
in July 1969. 
i-
A copy of the Board s regular salary schedule, as it would be 
r e
vised in accordance with this recommendation, was attached to the 
m e
morandum. The memorandum stated that the Office of the Controller 
• t 
r
ecommended approval of any overexpenditures in the 1968 budget accounts 
r e s
ulting from approval of this proposal. 
It was recommended that, with the approval of the Board member 
^ving the assignment for internal administrative affairs, the Per-
sonnel Division be responsible for making adjustments in the per diem 
hourly rates of employees serving on a when-actually-employed basis, 
a n <
i that the Office of the Controller and the Division of Personnel 
Administration use Government regulations and interpretations as guides 
l n
 deciding questions of administration and procedure. 
The Board approved unanimously the recommendations in the memo-
r a
ndum, a copy of which is attached as Item No. 7.

Director appointment. John N. Stauffer, President, Wittenberg 
University, Springfield, Ohio, had submitted his resignation as a 
director of the Cincinnati Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleve-
land effective August 31, 1968. At today's meeting the Board agreed 
to ascertain through Chairman Clay of the Cleveland Reserve Bank 
whether Phillip R. Shriver, President, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, 
w
ould accept appointment if tendered as a director of the Cincinnati 
Branch effective September 1, 1968, for the unexpired portion of the 
term ending December 31, 1969, with the understanding that if it was 
found that he would accept, the appointment would be made. 
M r • 
Secretary's Note: It having been ascertained 
that he would accept, an appointment telegram 
was sent to Dr. Shriver on June 28, 1968. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: On June 19, 1968 a letter 
was sent today to Bank of America National 
Trust and Savings Association, San Francisco, 
California, acknowledging receipt of notice 
of its intent to establish an additional branch 
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, to be located in 
Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas. 
As recommended in a memorandum from the Divi-
sion of Research and Statistics dated June 17, 
1968, Governor Robertson, in the absence of 
Governor Sherrill, authorized on behalf of 
the Board on June 19 acceptance of a research 
proposal entitled "The Effects of Inflation 
on the Distribution of Income and Wealth,"

which was submitted to the Board's Consultant 
Committee on Price Measurement for financial 
support by Pennsylvania State University. It 
was understood that the project would require 
a one-year period for completion and that the 
total cost would not exceed $12,400, with a 
maximum of $6,200 to be expended in calendar 
1968. 
As recommended in a memorandum from the Office 
of the Secretary, Governor Robertson approved 
on behalf of the Board on June 19, 1968, an 
increase in the basic annual salary of Niles J. 
Wusterbarth, Summer Assistant in that Office, 
from $5,565 to $6,959, with a change in title 
to Summer Research Assistant, effective June 19, 
1968 (date of entrance upon duty). 
Governor Sherrill today approved on behalf 
of the Board memoranda recommending the fol-
lowing actions relating to the Board's staff: 
John Kalchbrenner as Economist, Division of Research and Statis-

Dear 
i K • 
'h: t-Urd 
Following the recommendations of the Conference of Presidents 
at
*d the joint meeting of the Board of Governors and Reserve Bank 
Residents, the Board on Thursday, June 20, gave formal approval to 
Public release of the final report of the Steering Committee for the 
F u
ndamental Reappraisal of the Discount Mechanism Distribution will be 
made at this time in the following manner: 
to groups of bankers as 
c
°ntacted by Governor Mitchell and the staff; to Professor Lester V. 
Chandler, Academic Consultant to the Discount Study and such other 
a c
ademic consultants as he chooses to contact and solicit comments from 
°
n
 behalf of the Board; to the members of the American Economic 
Association with an indicated specialization in the field of money and 
banking; to the press; and to any other individuals or institutions 
e x
Pressing an interest in receiving it. The version released will be 
e s
sentially that distributed under date of June 12, 1968, although 
* few subsequent suggestions for language changes made by Reserve Bank 
residents have been adopted. 
As reported at the June 18 joint meeting, the staff is 
Preparing a press release to accompany the report which presents a 
briefer and less technical description of the proposed redesign. 
Comments made during discussion at the joint meeting are being taken 
il
*to account in the drafting of this document. It is expected that such 
a
 Paper will reduce the kind of confusion that was manifested among 
members of the Federal Advisory Council and the Reserve Bank Boards of 
directors in interpreting the technically-oriented report. 

i§ : 
-2-
The Board of Governors has been in contact with the American 
a
nkers Association concerning the prospective release of the report, 
that organization is establishing a special group to comment on it. 
® Board also believes that it would be advisable to send copies of 
®
 re
P°rt to the state banking associations in order to assure the 
est possible distribution within the banking community. However, 
°ard members are of the view that any such distribution might most 
ppropriately be made by the Reserve Banks to the state associations 
d
 t h
in their respective Districts. It was also felt it might be 
. Arable for Reserve Banks to consider holding orientation meetings 
t h
 groups of their member banks. 
^ 
The Board also decided at its June 20 meeting that the report 
"p-j^ederal Reserve's Discount Mechanism: A Report on Research Under-
^^ILJ-n ConnpeMnn With a Federal Reserve System Study, 1965-1967, by 
sh
 n a r d

release in morning papers 
of Wednesday, June 26. 
June 25, 1968. 
The Federal Reserve System is entering into contract 
u e
8otiations with Marshall Communications, Santa Ana, California, for 
a n a u
tomated communications switch, the Board of Governors of the 
Astern announced today. It is expected that the contract will be 
s i
8ned by early fall, at the latest. 
Plans for replacement of the Federal Reserve's present 
t e
letypevriter-actuated, nationwide leased wire network for the trans-
fer n f money, securities, and economic data with an advanced electronic 
s y s t p 
m, of which the message switch will be a key unit, were announced 
b y
 the Board February 27. 
Specifications detailing performance requirements for the 
«imunications system were furnished to equipment manufacturers and 
SUppi4 iers and a number of proposals and designs for meeting those 
^irements were obtained. The proposal by Marshall Communications 
s
 adjudged the best, both from the standpoint of performance and of 
c
Ost > and other respondents were notified of this decision.

D e
ar Mr. Huddleston: 
This refers to your telegram of April 25, 1968, in 
*hich you inquire whether the Board has any objection under 
p 
rf 
j-uvjuxit wiitLiici LUC u u a i u 11 do any U U J C U L I U H UI 
egulation Q, "Payment of Interest on Deposits", to ten cus-
omers with $10,000 forming a cooperative for the collective 
^vestment of their funds in one $100,000 certificate of deposit 
and the bank paying 6 1/4 per cent per annum interest thereon, 
a s
suming that the deposit is a single maturity deposit that does 
n o t m
ature for at least six months. 
As the Board stated in adopting the schedule of 
Permissible rates on single maturity time deposits of $100,000 
°r more, which became effective April 19, 1968, the principal 
P
U r
pose of raising the rates on such deposits with maturities 
specified in the schedule is to guard against disruption of 
n a
ncial markets that could occur in the event of an undue 
extraction of such deposits. (See Federal Register of 
24, 1968, Volume 33, page 6233.) Pooling of deposits to 
a
in the higher rates would be inconsistent with this purpose. 
y^llii-
i that 
Consequently, the Board would consider that a bank 
Pays a higher rate on a deposit that it knows or has reason 
know results from pooling funds principally for the purpose 
o t
 Staining a higher rate of interest would be acting contrary 
t o
 the spirit of the current Supplement to the Regulation.
