Discount rate. The Secretary noted that the Board had received 
a telegram advising that the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia had established a discount rate of 4-3/4 per cent, subject 
to review and determination by the Board of Governors. 
Comments by Board members reflected a view against considering 
a further reduction in the discount rate at this moment. The Treasury 
f ? ; : • ' • ••

financing was one of the factors involved, and the rapidity of recent 
di scount rate moves also was cited as a factor favoring some delay. 
It was agreed not to reject the Philadelphia proposal formally, 
but rather to defer action on it, with the understanding that the 
Secretary would get in touch with the President of the Bank and advise 
*him why the Board was not prepared to act at this particular time. 
The meeting then adjourned.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
FIRST HOLDING COMPANY, INC., 
Waukesha, Wisconsin, 
approval of acquisition of 
® per cent or more of the voting 
^ares of Elm-Brook State Bank, 
Brookfield, Wisconsin. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
s°ction 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
l8^2(a)(3)) a nd section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), the application of First Holding Company, Inc., 
a U k° s h a> Wisconsin ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding company 
fo 
tlle Board!s prior approval of the acquisition of 00 per cent or 
fliore nc 
the voting shares of Elm-Brook State Bank, Brookfield, 
W l s c°ns i n ("Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
en notice of receipt of the application to the Wisconsin 
^Issioner of Banking and requested his views and recommendation. 

209

The Commissioner responded that he offered no objection to approval 
°f the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on November 20, 1970 (35 Federal Register 17879), 
Providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
ar*d views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
W a s forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
consideration. The time for filing comments and views has expired 
a n d all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
t h e factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
a n d managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant and 
banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities 
to K 
b G served. Upon such consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant controls four banks with aggregate deposits of 
Si / 
million, representing 1.7 per cent of total bank deposits in 
Wig consin, and is the fifth largest banking organization in that State. 
banking data are as of June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect bank 
hol d i n a 
company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board to 
date 
Applicant's acquisition of Bank, with deposits of $6.4 million, 
^uld 
n°t change this ranking or significantly increase its share of 
doP°sits i n t h e state.

Bank is one of the smaller banks in a market which is 
approximated by Milwaukee County and the feast-central portion of 
Waukesha County west to and including the City of Waukesha. It has 
only 0,2 per cent of deposits in this market and its acquisition by 
Applicant would increase the latter's share of deposits in this 
market to only 4.7 per cent. Three large organizations control 
65,3 per cent of the deposits therein, and the addition of Bank to 
applicant's system would help Applicant compete v?ith the three larger 
°rganizations. Though some actual competition between Applicant's 
subsidiaries and Bank would be eliminated by consummation of the 
acquisition, this is mitigated by the geographical closeness of 
several banking alternatives to Bank. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
c°nsummation of the proposed acquisition would not have a substan-
tially adverse effect on competition in any relevant area. The banking 
^actors as they pertain to Applicant and its subsidiary banks are 
c°nsistent with approval of the application and as they pertain to 
Bank lcnd support for approval. Affiliation with Applicant would 
pr°vide Bank with greater depth in management and would alleviate a 
^nagement succession problem. Considerations relating to the conven-
ien 
c o and needs of the communitites concerned also favor approval of 
aPplication in that Applicant plans to add certain new services at 
Bank such as the elimination of all service charges on demand deposit 

accounts. It is the Board!s judgment that the proposed transaction 
would be in the public interest, and that the application should be 
approved. 
It is hereby ordered. For the reasons set forth in the 
findings summarized above, that said application be and hereby is 
approved, provided that the action so approved shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the date of this Order, 
unless such time be extended for good cause by the Board, or by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, January 22, 1971.

Robertson, Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, and Brimmer.

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
Action 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
l8^2(a)(3)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
CFR 222.3(a)), the application of Southern Bankshares, Inc., 
Richmond, Virginia ("Applicant"), a one-bank holding company, for 
t h e Board's prior approval of the acquisition of 100 per cent of 
th 
e voting shares (except directors' qualifying shares) of a 
n e W national bank into which would be merged Williamsburg National 
Williamsburg, Virginia ("Bank"). [The application was filed 
° n e to become a bank holding company pursuant to section 3(a)(1) 
of a e Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Due to Applicant's 

213 
-2-
ownership of 100 per cent of the voting shares of Southern Bank and 
Trust Company, Richmond, Virginia, and to the Bank Holding Company Act 
Amendments of 1970 (Public Law 91-607, 84 Stat. 1760), Applicant became 
a bank holding company by operation of law on December 31, 1970, and 
the Board, therefore, treats the application as one by such a company 
to acquire an additional bank.] The new bank has significance only as 
a means of acquiring all of the shares of the bank to be merged into 
it. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the shares of the 
Accessor organization is treated as a proposed acquisition of the 
shares of Bank. 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
bitten notice of receipt of the application to the Virginia 
Co®raissioner of Banking and to the Comptroller of the Currency and 
guested their views and recommendations. The Commissioner and the 
D e p u ty Comptroller recommended approval of the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
^deral Register on November 19, 1970 (35 Federal Register 17808), 
Pr°viding an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
a 8 forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
nQideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and 
^ those received have been considered by the Board.

214 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
and managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant and 
the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communi-
ties to be served. Upon such consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant presently controls one banking subsidiary, 
acquired on April 30, 1970. This institution, Southern Bank and 
Trust Company ("Southern Bank"), is located in Richmond, Virginia, 
and is the State's eleventh largest banking organization, controlling 
dePosits of $94.6 million, representing 1.3 per cent of total com-
mercial bank deposits in the State. 
(All banking data are as of 
June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect holding company acquisitions 
aPproved by the Board to date.) 
Southern Bank with control of 6.2 per cent of total 
dePosits in the Richmond market area, is the fifth largest of 
l 
hanks in that market.. Upon acquisition of Bank (deposits of 
$ 6 ft 
million), Applicant would continue to rank eleventh among the 
State'Q largest banking organizations and would increase its con-
t r o 1 °ver total State deposits to 1.4 per cent. 
Bank operates one office in Williamsburg and is, by a 
Sub 
8tantial margin, the smaller of the two banks operating in the 
Wixn 
^amsburg banking market. 
Its competitor, a subsidiary of the 
Statp> 
s largest banking organization, holds five times as many 
p 0 sit dollars as Bank. 

215 
-2-
Bank is located fifty-one miles from Southern Bank and 
there appears to be no existing competition between the two. 
Further, in view of the distance separating the two, the presence 
°f two intervening, sparsely settled counties, and the fact that 
Virginia law would preclude either bank from branching de novo 
into the area served by the other, there is little likelihood 
such competition developing in the future. 
Based upon the record, the Board concludes that consummation 
the proposal would have no adverse effect on competition in any 
relevant area. The banking factors as they relate to Applicant and 
tn its present and proposed subsidiary are satisfactory and con-
sistent with approval of the application. Considerations relating 
to the convenience and needs of the communities to be served lend 
8°me weight toward approval of the application; although the banking 
ngpfi- -
U 3 of the Williamsburg area appear adequately served, affiliation 
Appli c a n t would enhance Bank's ability to participate in the 
xPected growth of the area by increasing Bank's lending capabili-
ty 
s and enabling it to provide computer and specialized financial 
and T-R 
urust services. It is the Board's judgment that consummation 
of thp 
e Proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and 
that th 
Lne application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered, For the reasons set forth in the

. Item No. 3 
1/22/71 
January 25, 1971 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
Proposed amendments to its bank holding company regulation as a first 
step toward implementing the "Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 
1970." That law extended the Board's regulatory authority over bank 
holding companies to those that control only one bank. 
The regulatory amendments propose 10 activities to be regarded 
a s closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks under the 
law, and thus permissible for bank holding companies, subject to 
B°ord approval in individual cases. The proposal also spells out the 
&Gneral procedures the Board would follow in processing applications by 
i n d l v i d u a l companies to engage in these lines of business. 
Comments on the proposed amendments to Regulation Y (bank hold-
inS companies) should be received by the Board no later than February 26. 
Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, only those holding 
0niPanies that controlled 25 per cent or more of the voting stock of 
tv0 
c more banks were required to register with the Federal Reserve 
*imit their activities to banking and closely related activities. 
the 1970 amendments Congress expanded the law to cover corporations 
9tld oth 
°cr entities that control only one bank, gave the Board greater 
{at. . 
e to determine whsn control exists, and amended other parts of 
the A c 
under which bank holding companies may engage in bank-related 
a c t l n t l e s . 

218 
-2-
About 1,100 commercial banks with total deposits of $140 
billion were believed affiliated with one-bank holding companies as 
of April 1, 1970. As of last December 31, there were 119 registered 
bank holding companies--those controlling two or more banks. Their 
subsidiary banks held deposits of more than $70 billion. 
One of the regulatory amendments proposed by the Board today 
would apply to Section 4(c)(8) of the Act which states, in part, that 
a bank holding company may acquire "shares of any company the activities 
which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has de-
termined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking 
°r managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto." 
Under the proposal to implement this section of the Act, a 
bank holding company could apply to the Board for permission to retain 
0r acquire an interest in a company that engages solely in one or more 
o f the following activities: 
1. Making loans for its own account or for the account of 
others. This would include, for example, operations as a mortgage, 
finance or factoring company. 
2. Operating as an industrial bank. 
3. Servicing loans. 
4. Acting as fiduciary. 
5. Acting as investment or financial adviser. 
6. Leasing personal property where the initial lease provides

v i l L b e given an opportunity to express their views--including by 
means of a hearing, where appropriate--on the question whether perfor-' 
mance of the activity by the holding company "can reasonably be ex-
pected to produce public benefits... that outweigh possible adverse 1 
ejects..." 
• V 
• 
In cases where a holding company files an application to en-
Sage in an activity not specified in the regulation as adopted, the 
Board would publish notice of the application' in the Federal Register 
and give interested persons an opportunity to request a hearing not 
° n l y o n public benefit aspects but also on the question whether the 
activity sought is closely related to banking.

the regulation spelling out the procedures it will use in implementing 
Section 4(c)(12) of the Act. That section permits a company covered by 
4.1 
e 1970 amendments to acquire shares of any company--subject to con-
ations prescribed by the Bpardrr until..January 1, 198.1, so long as it 
divests itself by that date 'of either its. bank or of activities unre-
U t e d

' v ' Under these procedures, scheduled in the.proposal to take 
ef f 
ect as of January 26, 1971, prior approval of the Board would be 
Quired before any company may engage in any activity pursuant to 
°n 4(c)(12). 
If the company filed an irrevocable declaration that 
it would cease to be a bank holding company by January 1, 1981, an 
ication filed by it would be considered approved 45 days after the 
mPany W a R informed that its request has been received by the Federal 
^eservn 
v e unless the company was notified otherwise within that time. If 
C0Ripany had not filed the declaration, the Board would approve only 
applications in which the company demonstrated that the activities 
were necessary to enable the more efficient marketing of assets 
UbJeCt to divestiture. 

222

The Board also announced that it is considering limiting the 
scope of permissible activities under section 4(c)(5)--which relates 
to the acquisition of shares eligible for investment by national banks--
to lending or fiduciary activities commenced by a new company. The 
only exception would be where the shares involved are of the kinds and 
amounts explicitly eligible for investment by national banks under 
Federal .law.

Interests in Nonbanking Activities 
> By Act of Congress approved December 31, 19.70 (Public Law 
^1-607) the Bank Holding Company Act was"expanded to cover companies 
fcbat control only one bank. In conjunction with that.expansion Congress 
a®ended section 4(c)(8) of that Act, under which bank holding companies 
m ay acquire interests in nonbanking activities subject to certain restric-
tions and upon certain conditions. Under that section as amended, the 
^°ard is authorized to promulgate regulations governing acquisition of 
Coinpanies whose activities are "so closely related to banking or managing 
Or 
» 
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto." 
In determining whether a particular activity is a proper 
*Ucident to' banking or managing or controlling banks, the Board is 
i • 
tecluired to "consider whether its performance by an affiliate of a 
company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the 
such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in 
lciency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, Such as undue con-' • 
Cratlon of resources, decreased or unfair competition; conflicts of 
nterests, or~unsound banking practices." In promulgating-regulations

The regulation as proposed does not limit the location at 
vhich permissible activities may.be conducted to any State or .other 
geographical-, area.; Such -limitations might .be imposed by regulation, . 
by order in particular, cases. 
In.view of the amendment to section 4(c)(8), the Board is 
°nsidering limiting-the scope,of•acquisitions by holding companies 
th 
a t may be made on-the basis of section 4(c)(5) of the Act. Under . 
that 
•sOction, holding companies may acquire shares of ,the kinds and 
eligible for. investment by national banks under the provisions 
of ^ 
• ection 5136 of the Revised Statutes. Under present interpretations 
of t, e Board, a holding company may acquire interests in many of the 
type$ 
9* companies described above if located at a place at which 
° n e of 
the banks in the holding company may engage in the activities 
and such activities arc otherwise conducted in accordance , 
H t h c 
crtai n other limitations on the activities of national banks.

• ' The amendment-to section 4(c)(8) requires the Board to 
consider acquisitions by a bank holding company not only from the 
standpoint of whether the activities of the company to be acquired* 
closely related to banking, but also from the standpoint of 
^tltrust and related considerations. Accordingly, the Board believes 
tllat it should exercise its general regulatory authority over holding 
' jf 
companies under section 5 of the Act to limit the scope of permissible 
activities under section 4(c)(5) to lending and fiduciary activities 
commenced de novo, except where the shares involved are of the kinds 
Bk J 
amounts explicitly eligible for investment by a national bank under 
Federal 
r al statute law. Otherwise Congress1 purpose in amending section 4(c)(8) 
nii8ht be substantially nullified. Any limitations on section 4(c)(5) 
not affect the scope of activities permitted to a banking sub-
in 
fionb 
°f a bank holding company, but could affect acquisitions of a 
>anking company by such a bank, since any acquisition by a subsidiary 
ba^ 
would represent an indirect acquisition by the parent holding company* 
To aid in the consideration by the Board of the proposed 
ation, interested persons are invited to submit relevant data,

arguments. In accordance with the provisions of section 4(c)(8) 
Grested persons are also given opportunity to request a hearing 
Question whether an activity specified in the proposed amendment 
Is nQ 
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as 
t0 
a n 
Proper incident thereto". 
The Board anticipates proposing from time to time additional 
a cUvt t l 
les for inclusion in the regulation. Accordingly, holding 

- 6 -
companies or other interested persons may desire to submit proposals 
that they wish to have the Board consider for that purpose. 
However, 
t o facilitate prompt implementation of the amended section 4(c)(3), 
the Board does not intend to consider such proposals until-after 
O p t i o n , by the Board of Its initial regulation. For similar reasons, 
t h e B o a r d does not anticipate processing until that time applications 
f°r acquisitions on the basis of section 4(c)(3) received by the Reserve 
Banlcs after December 31, 1970, except in unusual and exigent circumstances.

Section 4(c)(12) of the Bank Holding Company Act permits a 
company covered by the 1970 amendments to retain or acquire any shares 
or engage in any activities until January 1, 1981, if the holding 
company complies with such conditions as the Board may by regulation 
Prescribe. In enacting this exemption, Congress had two types of 
companies in mind. The Board believes that the foregoing system of 
' 
I c 
• 
Prior approvals is necessary to assure that the exemption is used only 
ty those companies for purposes consistent with the Act. 
The two types of companies Congress had in mind in enacting 
Action 4(c)(12) are (1) a company that elects to divest itself of 
U s 
b a n k before 1981 and thereby cease to be a bank holding company 
a a d (2) a company that will be required to divest a nonbanking sub-
8idiary or cease to engage in a nonbanking activity owned or engaged

Under the proposal, approval of acquisitions by a company 
that elects to divest itself of its bank would normally be granted, 
Under a simple notification procedure. Acquisitions by other 
Cotr>panies normally would not be approved, unless the company 
^onstrates that the acquisition is necessary to assure that the 
c°®pany!s required divestitures can be made as quickly as possible, 
efficiently as possible, and with as little economic loss to the 
testing company as possible.
