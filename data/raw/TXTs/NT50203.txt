Letter to the Chairman of the House Committee 
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce commenting 
on H.J. Res. 946, a resolution that would 
authorize an investigation by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission of the effect on the 
security markets of the operation of institu-
tional investors. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York approving the Bank's plan to abolish 
the nonclerical salary structure for the 
Buffalo Branch. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller of 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger 
of The Bank of New Hope, New Hope, Virginia, into National Bank and 
Trust Company, Charlottesville, Virginia, was approved for transmittal 
to the Comptroller. The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of The Bank of New 
Hope and National Bank and Trust Company, Charlottesville, 
would eliminate a small amount of existing and potential 
competition, and the overall competitive effect of the 
transaction would be slightly adverse. 
Governors Mitchell and Daane noted that they would have pre-
ferred the conclusion recommended by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond, namely, that the proposed merger would have no adverse com-
petitive effects. 
Messrs. Egertson, Cleaver, Ettin, and Wiles withdrew from the 
meeting at this point and Mr. Hexter, General Counsel, entered. 
Technical assistance for Ethiopia. There had been distributed a 
memorandum dated January 11, 1968, from Mr. Solomon (Adviser) relating 
Item No.

to a request for technical assistance from the National Bank of 
Ethiopia. The most recent request had been in the form of a letter 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from the Governor of the 
National Bank seeking the services of a senior official from the Fed-
eral Reserve System for a period of nine to twelve months. Previously, 
the Board had been approached by the International Monetary Fund, but 
at the time no suitable candidate could be found who was willing to 
undertake the assignment. However, several names were now suggested 
for the Board's consideration. None of the persons mentioned had com-
bined experience in the research and bank examination functions, and 
all of them had either retired, resigned, or would soon retire from 
the System. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that someone with experi-
ence in the research and policy planning areas would be better equipped 
to advise with respect to the problems facing the National Bank of 
Ethiopia than one whose experience had been restricted to bank super-
vision. In addition, he would prefer someone who was still active in 
the System. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that he shared Governor Mitchell's 
views, as did Governor Daane. In addition, Governor Brimmer emphasized 
the long history of associations between the central bank of Ethiopia 
and the Federal Reserve and stressed the desirability of securing a 
person with wide practical experience in central banking.

There followed a discussion of several persons mentioned by 
members of the Board as possible candidates for the assignment, and it 
was understood that the staff would endeavor to expand the list of 
names to include persons who would meet the requirements suggested by 
Appointment of consultant. Governor Robertson stated that he 
was prepared to approve on behalf of the Board the appointment of 
J. Herbert Furth, former Adviser in the Division of International 
â€¢ ci.o^'t, 
crj c 
Finance, as a consultant, with compensation at the rate of $95 for 
each day worked, to advise on the foreign credit restraint program 
and related matters. 
No objection was indicated, and it was understood that the 
appointment would be approved. 
The meeting then adjourned.

If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's

Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your request for the Board's comments 
on H. J. Res. 946, a resolution authorizing an investigation of the 
effect on the security markets of the operation of institutional 
investors. The Board endorses the proposal to study this important 
aspect of the functioning of our financial system. 
In recent decades, financial intermediaries have developed 
into a major conduit for channeling the flow of funds in the United 
States economy, and this development has made a significant contribu-
tion to the efficiency with which the financial savings of the public 
is made available for the financing of economic growth. At the same 
time, however, the increasing importance of intermediaries has had 
significant implications for the functioning of securities markets, 
raising questions as to whether the practices and rules developed in 
an era when financial markets were characterized by many individual 
buyers and sellers continue to be appropriate. Some of these questions 
have particular relevance to the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve 
System: for example, have the activities of institutional investors 
introduced new elements of instability in financial markets? Have the 
market activities of institutional investors tended to moderate or 
aggravate the fluctuations in securities prices? Has the increased 
importance of institutional investors reduced or otherwise modified 
the role of credit in supporting speculative activity in financial 
markets? 
The Board's staff has been working with the staff of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on the design of a study which would
