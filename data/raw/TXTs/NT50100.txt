Req ues t of State member bank for permission to exercise fidu-
ciary powers (Items 13-14). The First State Bank of Oxford, Oxford, 
Alabama, had requested permission under condition of membership num-
bered 1 to exercise fiduciary powers. The request was referred to the 
Board by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta with a favorable recommen-
dation from Vice President Stephenson, but with a recommendation from 
President Patterson that the request be denied. 
Board letters to the Federal Reserve Banks of May 29, 1963, 
and July 22, 1963, contemplated that such a request was to be submitted 
t o the Board if the Reserve Bank was inclined to believe that it should 
be denied or that it involved any doubts such as to prevent a clear 
factual determination and approval by the Reserve Bank. 
A memorandum from the Division of Examinations dated June 12, 
1967 
reviewed the current request, the factors to be considered in 
accessing trust power applications that were discussed in a Board 
l etter to the Reserve Banks dated March 6, 1961, the reasons for the 
f aVorable recommendation of Vice President Stephenson, and the reasons 
f o 
r the adverse recommendation of President Patterson. The Division 
noted f.u 
tnat it had been the Board's long-standing view that a bank's 
neral condition, capital adequacy, and general management competency 
should K 
be given greater weight than local need for trust services or 
the 
expertise of bank personnel in this specialized area. 
President 
Patter* I 
s o n s criteria would represent a basic change in the approach to 

2495 
6/22/67 
-4- ^ ' 
fiduciary power applications since primary or at least equal emphasis 
would be placed on qualifications of proposed trust personnel, commu-
nity need, and growth prospects. 
The Division expressed the view that the Board's present crite-
ria were reasonably sound and effective, and it recommended that the 
Board reaffirm them. A draft of letter to President Patterson, copies 
of which would be sent to all Federal Reserve Banks, was submitted. 
The Division also recommended that the Board approve the request of 
First State Bank of Oxford, and a draft of letter evidencing such 
aPproval was submitted. 
Governor Brimmer expressed agreement with the staff conclusion 
t^at there was no reason to change the present criteria for judging 
fiduciary power applications. However, in light of the views expressed 
b y President Patterson he was curious as to what procedure the Atlanta 
Reserve Bank had been following. 
As to the current application, Governor Brimmer agreed with 
resident Patters on that the Oxford bank should strengthen its resources 
anticipation of the handling of trust business. Accordingly, he 
w°uld note in the letter to the bank an understanding that the bank 
Panned to retain competent legal counsel. Obviously, the bank would 
^
a v e 
t o defer engaging a full-time trained trust officer until it deter-
whether a sizable enough volume of trust business could be devel-
but the bank should proceed to retain legal counsel promptly.

Mr. Solomon commented that President Patterson was agreeable 
to following whatever criteria the Board specified. When the differ-
ence of opinion within the Atlanta Bank was reported, he (Mr. Solomon) 
had suggested that the divergent views be presented in the thought that 
it might be of interest to the Board to review the nature of the issues. 
In reply to the question that had been raised by Governor 
Brimmer regarding the Atlanta Bank's practices, Mr. Solomon pointed out 
that requests from State member banks to exercise fiduciary powers were 
relatively rare in the Sixth District and that until now such a request 
Probably had not been received during President Patterson's regime. 
The request of The First State Bank of Oxford was then approved 
u^animously; a copy of the letter transmitted to the bank through the 
Atlanta Reserve Bank is attached as Item No. 13. 
The criteria used in evaluating requests to exercise fiduciary 
Powers were reaffirmed. Attached as Item No. 14 is a copy of the let-
t e r sent to President Patterson in this regard. It was understood that 
t^e substance of the letter would be sent to the Presidents of all 
federal Reserve Banks for their information. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Federal Deposit 
insurance Corporation on the competitive factors involved in the pro-
Posed merger of The Farmers Bank, Centertown, Kentucky, into The 
a rtford Bank, Hartford, Kentucky, was approved unanimously for trans-
to i to the Corporation, the conclusion reading as follows: 

24.97 
6/22/67 
-6- ^ ' 
In view of the common ownership and management 
which has existed between The Hartford Bank and The 
Farmers Bank, Centertown, no significant degree of 
competition has developed between them; however, the 
proposal would eliminate the potential for greater 
competition in the event the common ownership ceased 
to exist. Overall, the effect of the proposal on 
competition would be slightly adverse. 
Banco del Comercio (Item No. 15). At its meeting on Monday, 
June 19, the Board gave preliminary consideration to a request from 
The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), New York, New York, 
permission to purchase up to 48 per cent of the voting shares of 
Banco del Comercio, Bogota, Colombia, under a plan whereby the shares 
would be acquired through four subsidiaries: 
an Edge corporation, a 
wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of another Edge corporation, a realty 
corporation, and a new corporation that would be organized for the 
Purpose of holding such shares. 
The legal and policy questions involved were reviewed in memo-
randa from the Division of Examinations and the Legal Division dated 
June 8 and June 5, 1967, respectively. It was the staff recommendation 
that the request be approved, subject to certain conditions, as set 
f o r t h in a proposed letter to Chase Manhattan Bank, with respect to 
PAN 
A American Shares Corporation, the corporation proposed to be 
°
r8aniZed. 
At the June 19 meeting Governor Robertson raised the question 
^ther investments by member banks in the stock of foreign banks 
not be subject to the 10 per cent limitation on capital and 

2498 
6/22/67 
-7- ^ ' 
surplus specified in the twelfth paragraph of section 25(a) of the 
Federal Reserve Act rather than the provision of Regulation M (Foreign 
Activities of National Banks) that authorizes member banks, with the 
consent of the Board, to invest directly or indirectly in the stock of 
foreign banks provided that the aggregate amount of such investments 
does not exceed 25 per cent of the member bank's capital and surplus 
taken together with the bank's investments in Edge and agreement corpo-
rations. Governor Robertson's views on this question were spelled out 
1n a memorandum that formed the basis for his oral comments at the 
Meeting. Copies of the memorandum had now been distributed to the 
°ther members of the Board. 
There had also been distributed a memorandum from Mr. Forrestal 
dated June 20, 1967, attached to which were copies of various back-
ground materials relating to the amendment to section 25 of the Federal 
Reserve Act that became effective July 1, 1966, and the implementation 
that legislation by the Board's revised Regulation M, which became 
6f f 
l ective March 15, 1967. Included with these papers was a memorandum 
that Mr. Forrestal had written to Governor Robertson under date of 
^Pril 
1957, in which he expressed the opinion that there was no 
^
e8al requirement that investments made by a member bank in foreign 
b a n k s roust be subjected to the 10 per cent limitation contained in 
e c t i o n 25(a) with respect to investments in Edge and agreement corpo-
rations.

In discussion Governor Maisel said it was not clear to him why 
Chase Manhattan Bank proposed to use a bank premises subsidiary in con-
nection with its plan to acquire shares of Banco del Comercio. This 
appeared to be a rather unusual use of a bank premises company, and he 
felt that the Board, as a matter of policy rather than law, might want 
to object to such an arrangement. In other respects he was agreeable 
to approving the Chase Manhattan proposal, for he was satisfied that 
it was in conformity with the wording of the law, which states that a 
member bank with capital and surplus of $1 million or more may, with 
the consent of the Board, acquire and hold "directly or indirectly" 
stock in one or more banks organized under the laws of a foreign 
country. 
Governor Brimmer inquired why Chase could not set up a second 
new subsidiary such as Pan American Shares Corporation, with similar 
restriction on its activities. 
Governor Robertson said it was his understanding that there 
W a s some question whether a new corporation would satisfy the require-
ments of Colombian law if it had as its only purpose the holding of 
8 h ares of Banco del Comercio. The bank premises affiliate would of 
c°urse be engaged in other business. He had suggested informally to 
C h a s e the possibility of establishing two new agreement corporations, 
b u t the bank maintained that that would create similar problems. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it would be undesir-
a b l e , in general principle, to sanction the use of a bank premises 

2500 
6/22/67 
-9- ^ ' 
company for the purpose now contemplated by Chase. If the Board 
approved in this instance, he did not see how it could refrain from 
granting permission in other cases that might come up. 
Governor Robertson agreed that an important precedent would be 
established by approval of the current proposal. He noted that the 
Congress had provided by statute a means by which member banks could 
make foreign investments, that is, through Edge or agreement corpora-
tions. However, if banks used that route, they were subject to the 
per cent limitation specified in the twelfth paragraph of section 
25(a). Chase Manhattan was getting close to the limit, and therefore 
obviously did not wish to proceed further in that direction. 
Governor Maisel said he did not agree with Governor Robertson's 
theory concerning the application of the 10 per cent limitation. How-
ever, it would be preferable in his view for Chase to set up another 
S ubsidiary, one that would not be an Edge or agreement corporation, 
rather than to use the bank premises company. He felt that the Board's 
v i s i o n in connection with Regulation M to establish a 25 per cent 
limitation on investments by member banks in foreign banks, including 
n vestments in Edge and agreement corporations, was appropriate. How-
ever h 
» ne would like to avoid the use of a realty company as a vehicle 
for 
making an indirect investment because that would represent the use 
such a company for a purpose out of line with its normal functions. 
Governor Robertson then commented on his basic position, which 
^as t h l«t the Board should confine indirect investments by a member bank 

250.1. 
6/22/67 
-10- ^ ' 
under the third paragraph of section 25 to those instances where a 
foreign country required the stock of its banks to be held by nationals 
of that country. He would consider it proper to allow Chase Manhattan 
to organize a corporation in Colombia for the purpose of holding stock 
of Banco del Comercio if that was necessary in order to conform to 
Colombian law. Those were the only instances in which he would permit 
indirect investments, however, because the Congress had provided a 
means by statute to enable U.S. banks to make indirect foreign invest-
ments through Edge and agreement corporations. It was his feeling, 
which he thought was borne out by the letters that the Board had 
bitten to the Congress and the Budget Bureau, that last year's legis-
lation was designed simply to permit member banks to do directly what 
they had already been permitted to do indirectly. 
Governors Maisel and Brimmer then restated their satisfaction 
with the 25 per cent limitation contained in Regulation M, and Governor 
Robertson asked for an explanation of their reasoning. 
Governor Maisel said it was his opinion, upon reading the mate-
rials attached to Mr. Forrestal's memorandum, that last year's amend-
ment to section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act should be regarded as a 
kasic change in the law. The Board itself had introduced the term 
HJ 
direct," and the concept of such a term was that investments by 
ember banks in foreign banks could be accomplished in some fashion 
t ^
e r than by a direct investment. If he understood correctly, Gover-
°
r Robertson was maintaining that, while Congress had passed legislation 

2S( )2 
6/22/67 
-11- ^ ' 
containing the terms "directly or indirectly," the Board should hold 
that the Congress intended something else, simply because there was no 
comment in the reports on the legislation to the effect that enactment 
of the legislation involved a major change. He saw no reason for the 
Board to take such a position and did not feel that that would be 
Proper. He would not want to say that the Congress did not mean what 
on the surface seemed clear from a reading of the statute simply 
because the Congressional intent had not been spelled out. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he was convinced by the reasoning 
set forth in Mr. Forrestal's memorandum of April 5, 1967, and in the 
^ g a l Division's memorandum of June 5, 1967. 
Governor Robertson said he recognized that the question was 
debatable. However, he came to a different conclusion. In letters 
Ser*t to the Budget Bureau and to the Congress, the Board had said that 
purpose of the proposed legislation was simply to enable member 
banks to do directly something that they had previously been permitted 
' to' d 
0 indirectly through Edge and agreement corporations. The Board 
drafted the proposed legislation itself, and the correspondence 
i n d i c a t e d what the Board intended. Accordingly, as he had said earlier, 
would only permit member banks to make indirect investments under 
c tion 25 where that was necessary to comply with the laws of a foreign 
country. 
Mr. Hexter brought out that the only relevant portion of the 
U g i s l 
. 
native history of the 1966 amendment to section 25 was contained 

25n3 
6/22/67 
-12- ^ ' 
in one sentence of the Senate Report, which stated that the amendment 
would authorize any member bank, upon such conditions and subject to 
such regulations as prescribed by the Board, to invest directly in any 
foreign bank that did no business in this country (except incidental 
to its foreign activities) and to make loans to such a bank without 
regard to section 23A but within limits prescribed by the Board. That 
statement was consistent with everything that had happened theretofore, 
so far as Board correspondence was concerned. In presenting the matter 
to the Congress, that was the sole purpose mentioned. 
Mr. Forrestal agreed that the Board had said that the purpose 
°f such legislation was to allow member banks to invest directly in 
foreign banks. However, it did not seem to him that the emphasis on 
U >1 : , 
the principal reason precluded the existence of a secondary reason. 
i. Q 
j • -; 
Mr. Hexter replied that the action the Board was being asked 
t° take, and which it had already taken to some extent in adopting the 
revised Regulation M, was more important than what had been spoken of 
a s the main purpose of the legislation. The Congress had said specifi-
cally 
that when an American bank wanted to invest in Edge or agreement 
c°rporations it could not invest more than 10 per cent of capital and 
U rplus. When the Congress then passed a law to enable U.S. banks to 
directly what they had been able to do indirectly, this did not mean 
him that the Congress was removing the 10 per cent limitation. 

2504 
6/22/67 
-13- ^ ' 
Chairman Martin then asked for an appraisal as to how it was 
felt that the public interest might be affected by permitting a trans-
action such as contemplated by Chase Manhattan. 
Mr. Hackley commented that there were two legal questions, each 
°f which could be argued two ways. First, even though the Board's 
recommendations and letters had indicated that the paramount objective 
o f legislation such as enacted last year was to authorize direct invest 
m ents in foreign banks by U.S. banks, nevertheless the Congress did 
U S e 
t h e word "indirectly." 
In his view, as long as an intermediate 
corporation was authorized to purchase the stock in question and such 
Purchase would not defeat the purpose of section 5136 of the Revised 
S tatutes, there would be no legal objection. In the present case the 
U s e of a new corporation or of the bank premises company would fall 
wi-thin the scope of the word "indirectly" as used in the statute. 
On the matter of the 10 per cent limitation, Mr. Hackley felt 
t^
e re w a s more question from the legal standpoint. However, the Board 
113(1 already issued a regulation that permitted member banks to invest 
n foreign banks up to 25 per cent of their capital and surplus. 
c°rdingly> if the Board were to resolve the first legal question in 
^avor f 
°f Chase Manhattan, he felt that it would be improper to deny 
Pending request unless the Board wanted to amend its regulation. 
With 
respect to the question of policy, Mr. Hackley noted that 
were also two sides to the argument. On the proposed use of 

2505 
6/22/67 
-14- ^ ' 
intermediate corporations, he did not think that public policy would 
be affected because Chase would be doing what the law now permitted, 
that is, investing in stock of a foreign bank through intermediate 
corporations. Particularly if the latter were not permitted to engage 
in other businesses, he could see no adverse public policy considera-
tions. When it came to the question of the 10 per cent limitation, 
however, arguments from the standpoint of public policy could be made 
both ways. 
Governor Maisel remarked that the Board, prior to issuing the 
revised Regulation M, had considered alternative percentages at consid-
erable length and then determined as a matter of policy that the 25 per 
cent figure was proper. 
Governor Brimmer said that he would be reluctant to reverse 
fcbat position at this time and in the present context, particularly 
W h e n several members of the Board were not present. He felt that the 
B°ard m u s t ; deal with the Chase Manhattan proposal on the basis of the 
r egulation that was outstanding. He was prepared to advise Chase that 
could proceed with the proposed investment except that it could not 
S e the bank premises company. 
Mr. Solomon said that he recognized the policy question involved, 
Vet h 
le wondered how it would look for the Board, if it accepted the 
e substantive issues, to insist that Chase set up another new corpo-
rate n instead of using the bank premises subsidiary. While he agreed 

2506 
6/22/67 
-15- ^ ' 
that bank premises companies ordinarily should not be used for other 
purposes, he raised for consideration whether it might not seem a bit 
technical to stand firm on so narrow a question of policy. 
Governor Maisel said he had the feeling that if a company was 
set up for a particular purpose it should not be used as a device to 
accomplish other purposes. If that principle was breached, it would 
be difficult for the Board in the future to insist on policy grounds 
th£*t a company be used only for the purpose for which it was established. 
Question was raised whether Chase could not make part of the 
investment itself, and it was explained that under Colombian law a par-
e n t and its subsidiaries were not regarded as separate entities, at 
l east for voting purposes. In other words, they could not each exercise 
v o t m g power. However, sister corporations were not regarded in the 
S a m e m a n n e r under Colombian law. Accordingly, if the use of the bank 
demises subsidiary was not permitted, it would be necessary for Chase 
create an additional corporation or to use some other existing sub-
sidiary if available. 
Governor Brimmer suggested that it would be up to Chase to 
d G 
m e how best to proceed in the circumstances. 
• i 
The Chase request was then approved, Governor Robertson dis-
sent i 
n8» except that it was understood that Chase would not be permitted 
S e the bank premises subsidiary for the purpose of making an invest-
nient i 
l n the stock of Banco del Comercio.

A copy of the letter sent to Chase Manhattan Bank pursuant to 
the Board's action is attached as Item No. 15. 
Regulation R. At its meeting on April 5, 1967, the Board 
decided to publish in the Federal Register for comment a proposed 
amendment to section 218.2 of Regulation R (Relationships with Dealers 
in Securities under Section 32 of the Banking Act of 1933). That sec-
tion exempts from the prohibition of section 32 interlocking services 
between member banks and securities firms that confine their underwrit-
ing (and other activities engaged in as principal rather than agent) 
to securities specified in the regulation. The proposed amendment would 
a d d to the list of securities in section 218.2 general obligations of 
S tates and political subdivisions. The approximate result would be to 
Permit interlocking relationships between member banks and securities 
firms that handle only securities that member banks themselves are per-
mitted to underwrite under section 5136 of the Revised Statutes. 
A memorandum from the Legal Division dated June 14, 1967, 
r eviewed the matter in the light of the comments received and suggested 
p°
ssible alternative courses of action. 
Members of the Board expressed the view that the question was 
sufficient importance to warrant deferring a decision until such 
.*me as additional members of the Board were available to participate 
the discussion, particularly since it appeared that there was no 
O k . a t pressure for a decision. 

250?

Governor Robertson, who noted that he might not be present 
when the subject was considered, pointed out that the Congress had 
adopted a policy many years ago with respect to divorcing commercial 
banks from the securities business. The Congress did permit the under-
writing by banks of general obligations of States and political sub-
divisions because it believed that a public benefit would be derived, 
but it had not gone further. In his view, before broadening the scope 
°f the exemptions in Regulation R to the extent contemplated by the 
Proposed amendment, the Board must determine that the general prohibi-
tion against interlocking directorships contained in section 32 was 
n°t sufficiently important to warrant continuing to restrict the area 
interlock. This seemed to him a close case, one that involved 
i 
determining what advantages would be gained and appraising the public 
benefits. He found it difficult to conclude at this point that signif-
i c a n t public benefits would be derived from the proposed action.

Memphis building program (Item No. 16). On September 21, 1966, 
e Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to purchase 
balding site for the construction of a new building for the Memphis 
anch. xhe agreement with the seller, the Memphis Housing Authority, 
°vided that the improvement to be constructed on the site was to be 
ni
shed by December 31, 1970, unless the Reserve Bank showed good 
C a u 8 * for delay.

The Reserve Bank had now transmitted a copy of a contract with 
an architectural firm for professional services in connection with the 
development of plans for the proposed branch building, and the Reserve 
Bank was anxious to instruct the architects to begin the schematic 
design phase of the work. 
The Board's letter to the Reserve Banks of April 26, 1967, had 
S uggested deferment of new construction pending a study of improved 
guidelines for planning new buildings. However, the Division of Bank 
Operations, in a memorandum of June 5, 1967, recommended that the St. 
L°uis Reserve Bank be authorized to proceed with the schematic design 
Phase of the work on the proposed new Memphis building with the under-
standing that the design preferred by the Bank, with simple drawings 
a n d an estimate of cost, would be submitted to the Board for review 
befor e further work was performed by the architects. It was hoped 
L n a t by such time some firm decision would have been reached on the 
q U estions raised in the Board's letter of April 26 as they applied to 
t h e Memphis project. 
In reply to a question, Mr. Farrell said that the Division's 
0 mmendatlon
 w o u l d have been the same irrespective of the time ele-
n t introduced by the agreement with the Memphis Housing Authority. 
Unanimous approval then was given to the letter to the Federal 
S n V e Bank of St. Louis of which a copy is attached as Item No. 16.

withdrew from the meeting. 
Cincinnati Branch director. Mr. Del R. Cawthorne was resigning 
as a director of the Cincinnati Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland at the end of June in order to return to the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City, and two men, both college presidents, had been 
S u8gested for consideration as his successor. 
j 
In discussion Governor Brimmer raised the question whether the 
base for selection had not been narrowed unduly by restricting the 
search to academicians, in reflection of a custom of long standing that 
°ne directorship at Cincinnati was held by such a person. 
Governor Robertson suggested that Governor Brimmer's point might 
b e d i S c u s s e ( j i n broader context at the next meeting of the Conference 
o f Chairmen of the Federal Reserve Banks. 
Chairman Martin referred to the character of the duties assigned 
0 branch directors and noted that educators who served in such a capac-
ty were in a unique position to disseminate information concerning the 
t 
c tions of the Federal Reserve System. He indicated that he was 
> *8htly acquainted with the two men who had been suggested to succeed 
Mr 
p Hawthorne and that his reaction was generally favorable. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that in the circumstances he would 
K t ?. 
be 
lJ-lng to withdraw his question in this instance, although he

President of Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio, would accept

requested clarification of certain aspects of the factors considered 
in such applications, and the Board has taken this occasion to 
review its present policy in that respect. 
The Board's letter S-1872, dated May 29, 1963, described 
the circumstances in which the Reserve Banks, acting on behalf of 
the Board, may approve such applications, or alternatively, should 
forward them to the Board for appropriate action. No change is 
c°ntemplated in that procedure. 
The Board's supplemental letter 
S-1879, dated July 22, 1963, listed the factors which should be 
evaluated by each Reserve Bank in support of its conclusion on such 
aPplications, but did not specify any order of importance. 
In currently reviewing its policy with respect to 
fiduciary power applications, the Board has carefully considered 
the relative importance of these factors. While there is no ques-
tion but that it is desirable for proposed trust officers and trust 
committee members to have special qualifications such as experience 
in actual fiduciary work, trust law, investments, and accounting to 
fulfill 
their fiduciary duties, the same degree of expertise cannot 
b e expected in a small, part-time fiduciary function as in a larger 
trust department. 
The Board continues to feel that all pertinent factors 
should be considered in passing on fiduciary power applications, but 
that greater emphasis should be accorded to bank condition, adequacy 
°f capital, and competency of bank management.

If these factors are seriously adverse, the Reserve Bank 
should attempt to obtain improvement, or perhaps urge the bank to 
withdraw its application and submit it later when these factors 
could be considered satisfactory. Failing that, the Reserve Bank 
ordinarily should recommend to the Board that the application be 
denied. 
The following additional factors continue to be very 
important and should still be evaluated by the Reserve Banks for 
each such application: 
(1) Proposed trust officer. 
(2) Proposed supervision of fiduciary business. 
(3) Proposed legal counsel. 
(4) Local conditions, including demonstrated community 
need for fiduciary services and the related com-
petitive situation. 
Bank management should understand that these factors also 
must be reasonably favorable, for otherwise the application might 
be denied. 
The procedure outlined in the Board's letter S-1879 
remains unchanged in all other respects. 
In view of all the circumstances, the Board has approved 
subject application, and a separate letter to that effect is being 
S ent to Vice President Stephenson for forwarding to the member bank.

Gentlemen: 
This refers to your letter of March 13, 1967, requesting 
Permission of the Board of Governors, pursuant to sections 25 and 
25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, for The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(National Association)("CMB"), New York, to acquire and hold, 
directly or indirectly through Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking 
Corporation ("CMOBC"), New York; Arcturus Investment and Develop-
ment: Limited ("Arcturus"), Montreal, Canada; Overseas Realty 
Corporation ("Overseas"), New York; and, Pan American Shares 
Corporation ("Pan American"), New York, up to 48 per cent of the 
voting shares of Banco del Comercio ("Banco"), Bogota, Colombia, 
a t a cost not to exceed US$7,600,000. 
The Board hereby grants its consent for The Chase 
Manhattan Bank (National Association) ("CMB"), New York, to acquire 
and hold, directly or indirectly through Chase Manhattan Overseas 
Ranking Corporation ("CMOBC"), New York; Arcturus Investment and 
development Limited ("Arcturus"), Montreal, Canada; and Pan 
American Shares Corporation ("Pan American"), New York, up to 
^ 
per cent of the voting shares of Banco del Comercio ("Banco"), 
B°gota, Colombia, at a cost not to exceed US$7,600,000, provided 
such shares are acquired within one year from the date of this 
iotter. 
After careful consideration of your request to acquire 
scares of the Colombian bank through Overseas, the Board has con-
cluded that bank premises companies should not be used to purchase 
.°rei.gn bank stock. Consequently, the Board's consent to the 
"direct acquisition of Banco del Comercio's shares through 
U verseas is denied. 

The Chase Manhattan Bank

The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding of 
shares of Banco by CMB is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) That CMB shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in Banco if Banco at any time fails 
to restrict its activities to those permissible to a 
corporation in which a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, with 
the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase and 
hold stock, or if Banco establishes any branch or 
agency or takes any action or undertakes any operation 
in Colombia or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to CMOBC; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, CMB 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding the 
activities of Banco as it may require from time to time; 
(3) That CMB, CMOBC, Arcturus, and Pan American shall 
not carry on their books the shares acquired of Banco 
at a net amount in excess of their proportionate share 
of the book capital accounts of Banco, after giving 
effect to the elimination of all known losses; and, 
(4) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by 
Banco be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K 
in the same manner as if Banco were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends until further notice the provisions of subparagraph (1), above, 
S o far as they relate to restrictions on loans granted by Banco in 
Colombia in th£. currency of that country. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding of 
shares of Banco by Pan American is granted subject to the condition that: 
Pan American will restrict its activities to the holding of shares of 
foreign banks pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the Federal 
Reserve Act and Regulation M and that, when required by the Board, CMB 
will cause Pan American (a) to permit examiners selected or auditors 
approved by the Board to examine Pan American and (b) to furnish the 
Board with such reports as it may require from time to time. The Board's 
c°nsent is granted subject to the further condition that CMB will dispose 
°f its shares of Pan American if CMB is advised by the Board that their 
holding is inappropriate.

The foregoing consent is given with the understanding that 
the investment now being approved, combined with other foreign loans 
and investments of CMB, CMOBC and Chase International Investment 
Corporation, will not cause the total of such loans and investments 
to exceed the guidelines established under the voluntary foreign 
credit restraint effort now in effect and that due consideration is 
being given to the priorities contained therein.

Dear Mr. Weigel: 
This refers to your letters of May 3 and May 4, 1967, 
concerning the Bank's agreement with the architects in connection 
with the development of plans for the proposed Memphis Branch 
building project and the provision of the purchase agreement for 
the building site which calls for completion of the proposed 
branch building by December 31, 1970. 
In view of the circumstances, the Board authorizes 
your Bank to proceed with the schematic design phase for the 
proposed new building for the Memphis Branch, with the 
understanding that the design preferred by the Bank, including 
simple floor-plan drawings, sketches of building elevations, 
and an estimate of cost, will be submitted to the Board for 
review, before the architects begin preliminary plans and 
outline specifications, called the "design development phase" 
in the contract with the architects. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

Item No. 19 
6/22/67 
June 16, 1967. 
Subject: 
Sharing of Board Computer 
with Government Agencies . 
In February 1966, the Board established policy guidelines for staff 
r esponses to outside requests requiring processing of financial statistics 
collected by the System. 
Similar policy guidelines have not yet been established with regard 
t o the direct use of our computer facilities by Government agencies. 
Because 
°f the active interest in the sharing of electronic computer time and related 
S ervices within and among agencies in the executive branch and because of 
C urrent and anticipated inquiries, both the Division of Data Processing and 
the Offi c e of the Controller are of the opinion that Board policy and pro-
cedures pertaining to such sharing ought to be established now. Adoption of 
a Policy would relieve the Board of having to consider matters which can be 
appropriately handled, negotiated, discussed and decided upon at the Division 
level. 
It is recommended, therefore, that Board policy with regard to use 
the Board's electronic computer and associated data processing facilities 
a^d services by Government agencies on a reimbursable basis be established 
a c cording to the following principles: 
I. That any use of the Board's computer time or associated 
data processing facilities and services by a Government agency 
°n a reimbursable basis be limited to residual time, that is, to 
whatever time may be available after the Board's needs have been 
adequately met. 
II. That each request for use of the Board's electronic 
computer time or associated data processing facilities and 
services on a reimbursable basis by a Government agency be 
considered jointly by the Division of Data Processing and the 
Office of the Controller for the purpose of determining whether 
the request should be granted. 
III. That a Government agency granted use of the Board's 
Computer or associated data processing equipment on a reimburs-
able basis not be allowed to directly operate the equipment so 
used. The Board will furnish the necessary operators and 
appropriate supervision. 

IV. That the Board be reimbursed for use of computer time 
or associated data processing facilities and services in accord-
ance with appropriate hourly rates, such as those shown in the 
attached appendix, but as jointly revised periodically by the 
Division of Data Processing and the Office of the Controller 
whenever circumstances, such as changes in rentals or salaries, 
appear to warrant. 
V. That the foregoing guidelines with respect to cost and 
priorities not necessarily apply to those Government agencies 
with which we have established working arrangements for joint 
sharing of computer time or associated data processing equipment 
Attachment.
