Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of The Citizens Savings Bank, 
Columbiana, Ohio, into The Farmers National Bank of Salem, Salem, Ohio, 
was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the 
Currency. The conclusion read as follows: 

1.313 
4/29/70 
-2-
There is competition existing between The Citizens Savings 
Bank, Columbiana, and The Farmers National Bank of Salem, and 
there is potential for increased competition between them. 
The 
proposed merger of the subject banks would increase the size of 
the largest bank in Columbiana County and the resulting bank 
would hold nearly 27 per cent of deposits in the county which 
is experiencing economic growth. Alternative banking facilities 
would remain in both Salem and Columbiana. 
Overall, the effect 
of the instant proposal on competition would be adverse. 
Brenton Banks. A draft of an order reflecting the Board's 
approval on April 21, 1970, of the application of Brenton Banks, Inc., 
Des Moines, Iowa, to acquire shares of Northwest Brenton Bank and Trust 
Company, Urbandale, Iowa, a proposed new bank, had been distributed. 
The issuance of the order was authorized; a copy is attached 
as Item No. 1. 
First Florida Bancorporation. A draft had been distributed of 
an order reflecting the Board's action on April 21, 1970, approving the 
application of First Florida Bancorporation, Tampa, Florida, to acquire 
shares of Liberty National Bank of St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg, 
Florida. 
The issuance of the order was authorized; a copy is attached 
as Item No. 2. 
Dacotah Bank Holding Co. A draft had been distributed of an 
order reflecting the Board's action on April 21, 1970, approving the 
application of Dacotah Bank Holding Co., Aberdeen, South Dakota, to 
acquire shares of Bank of Lemmon, Lemmon, South Dakota. 
The issuance of the order was authorized; a copy is attached 
a s Item No. 3.

Huntington Bancshares. A memorandum from the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation dated April 15, 1970, and other pertinent papers, 
including a proposed order, had been distributed in connection with an 
application of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Columbus, Ohio, to 
acquire shares of The Bank of Wood County Company, Bowling Green, Ohio. 
The recommendations were favorable. 
The application was approved unanimously, and the issuance of 
the order was authorized. A copy of the document, as issued, is attached 
as Item No. 4. 
A memorandum from the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
dated April 28, 1970, and other pertinent papers had also been distrib-
uted in connection with an application of Huntington Bancshares to 
acquire shares of Lagonda National Bank of Springfield, Springfield, 
Oh io. The recommendations were favorable. 
The application was approved unanimously, and the issuance of 
an order reflecting this action was authorized. A copy of the document, 
as issued, is attached as Item No. 5. 
Southeast Bancorporation. A memorandum from the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation dated April 27, 1970, and other pertinent 
papers had been distributed in connection with an application of South-
east Bancorporation, Inc., Miami, Florida, to acquire shares of South-
east National Bank of Orlando, Orlando, Florida, a proposed new bank. 
The recommendations were favorable.

The application was approved unanimously, with the understand-
ing that an order- would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he understood Southeast Bancor-
poration had drawn up a plan for future expansion of its organization 
which it would be willing to make available for inspection. 
It was 
suggested that this plan might be useful in conjunction with a study 
of the Florida banking structure that was being undertaken by the Bank-
ing Markets Section. 
Central Banking System. Pending before the Board was an appli-
cation of Central Banking System, Inc., Oakland, California, to acquire 
shares of Bank of Fairfield, Fairfield, California, a proposed new bank. 
The capital position of the holding company's lead bank, Central Valley 
National Bank, Oakland, had been a matter of concern to the Board for 
some time, and in a letter dated December 23, 1969, to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Board had stated that it would attri-
bute significant weight to the lead bank's capital position in considering 
any additional bank acquisitions proposed by the applicant. Pursuant to 
the understanding at the Board meeting on January 26, 1970, members of 
the Board's staff had met with representatives of Central Valley National 
Bank to clarify the Board's position. 
The application to acquire Bank of Fairfield was discussed in 
detail in a memorandum from the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
dated April 23, 1970, and accompanying pertinent papers. Among other 

1321 
4/29/70 
-5-
points, the Division noted that the application had been in the pipeline 
prior to the transmittal of the Board's December 1969 letter, and that 
there had been a recent indication of some improvement in the bank's 
capital level. The Division recommended that the application be ap-
proved; however, it suggested that a statement be included in the letter 
of notification to Central Banking System that would indicate that the 
effectiveness of management's efforts to improve the lead bank's capital 
position would be the subject of continuing critical analysis by the 
Board with respect to any additional proposed acquisitions. 
Tentative expressions by members of the Board indicated that 
Governors Maisel and Sherrill would approve the application and that 
Governors Robertson and Brimmer would deny, on the grounds that Central 
Valley National Bank continued to be undercapitalized and management, 
rated only fair, was not making a sufficient effort to improve the 
situation. 
Accordingly, it was understood that the application would be 
brought back for further consideration when additional members of the 
Board were available. 
Mercantile Bankshares. A memorandum from the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation dated April 20, 1970, had been distributed relat-
ing to the applications (1) of Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, Balti-
more, Maryland, to become a bank holding company through the acquisition 
of shares of the successors by merger to Mercantile-Safe Deposit and 
Trust Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and The Annapolis Banking and Trust 

1321 
4/29/70 
-6-
Company, Annapolis, Maryland, which would be in addition to those of 
one bank already held; (2) of Severn Bank and Trust Company, Annapolis, 
Maryland, for membership in the Federal Reserve System; and (3) of 
Severn Bank and Trust Company to merge with Annapolis Banking and Trust 
Company. 
Governor Brimmer noted that the lead bank in the proposed hold-
ing company system would be a noninsured bank, and he questioned whether 
Board approval would be advisable in the circumstances. 
It was understood that the staff would explore the question 
further prior to consideration of the matter when additional members of 
the Board were available. 
Seller's points under Regulation Z. 
In August 1969 Chairman 
Sullivan of the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the House Banking 
and Currency Committee inquired whether seller's points were included 
in finance charges under the terms of Regulation Z, Truth in Lending. 
Governor Robertson had replied that Regulation Z did require seller's 
points to be included in the finance charge, but indicated that the 
Board would review its position in consultation with other Federal agen-
cies involved in truth-in-lending enforcement as well as with the Federal 
Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. 
In a memorandum 
dated April 27, 1970, the Division of Supervision and Regulation now 
recommended the sending of a letter to Mrs. Sullivan that would reaffirm 
the position that seller's points were part of the finance charge. 

4/29/70

Governor Maisel expressed the view that the economic analysis 
of the problem was" deficient in certain respects and, in addition, 
reflected erroneous assumptions. 
Further, there was a legal point that 
he felt should be explored. 
It was understood that the matter would be brought back for 
consideration after further staff review, in which Mr. Fisher of the 
Research Division would participate, in the light of Governor Maisel's 
comments. 
Security Bank and Trust Company. Unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas relating to a request 
from the Vice Chairman of Security Bank and Trust Company, Wharton, 
Texas, for a statement regarding certain nonbankable loans, the treat-
ment of which for income tax purposes had been questioned by the Internal 
Revenue Service. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 6. 
Waiver of interest. 
In a memorandum dated April 17, 1970, the 
Legal Division considered the question whether the waiver by a member 
bank of the cashing of interest coupons on bonds issued by a depositor 
constituted an indirect payment of interest. This question had been 
raised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas on behalf of a member bank 
which asked for a ruling on the offer of a competitor national bank, 
when bidding to become a county depository, to pay the maximum amount of 
interest permitted by Regulation Q on funds placed with the bank and, 
in addition, to waive a certain amount of interest on the county's road 
bonds already held by the bank. 

1321 
4/29/70 
-8-
The Legal Division concluded that such a waiver would consti-
tute an indirect payment of interest. Attached to the memorandum was 
a proposed letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas that would re-
flect this view as well as a proposed letter to the Comptroller of the 
Currency asking that the national bank be apprised of the Board's views 
and appropriate action taken to assure that future bids would be con-
sistent with the Board's ruling. 
After discussion the conclusion of the Legal Division was 
accepted, and unanimous approval was given to the letters to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Comptroller of the Currency, as attached 
under Items 7 and 8. 
Pooling of funds. 
In a memorandum dated April 21, 1970, the 
Legal Division discussed a proposal whereby the New Mexico Livestock 
Board would consolidate various deposits with a number of New Mexico 
banks into one deposit with First National Bank in Albuquerque, New 
Mexicoj 
The consolidated deposit would be in an amount in excess of 
$100,000 and have a maturity of more than one year. The bank would then 
sell participations in the deposit to the banks from which the funds 
would be withdrawn. 
It was the conclusion of the Legal Division that such an arrange-
ment would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the differential 
between maximum permissible rates on deposits under $100,000 and deposits 
of that amount or more, if First National Bank treated the entire amount 

J vV^O 
4/29/70 
-9-
of funds as a deposit for all purposes, including reserve requirements, 
insurance assessments, and reporting requirements. The participations 
by the other banks would constitute a borrowing by them. Attached to 
the memorandum was a draft of letter to First National Bank in Albuquer-
que that would reflect this view. 
Discussion developed some support for the Legal Division's con-
clusion, but Governor Brimmer indicated that he would have come to the 
opposite conclusion, namely, that the proposal represented a pooling of 
funds for the express purpose of enabling the banks to pay to the depos-
itor a higher rate of interest than was permissible under Regulation Q. 
It was understood that a decision would be deferred pending 
consideration of the matter by agencies participating in the Coordinat-
ing Committee on Bank Regulation. 
Bank of Minneapolis and Trust Company. 
In a memorandum dated 
April 28, 1970, the Legal Division recommended that a cease and desist 
order (draft attached) be issued pursuant to the provisions of the 
Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966 on the basis of an agree-
ment and consent to issuance of such an order negotiated between repre-
sentatives of Bank of Minneapolis and Trust Company, Minneapolis, Minne-
sota, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and the Board. 
Negotia-
tions had been conducted pursuant to the understanding at the Board 
meeting on April 17, 1970. 

1321 
4/29/70 
-10-
Following a review by Mr. O'Connell of circumstances leading 
to the recommendation, the issuance of the cease and desist order was 
authorized. A copy of the document, as issued, is attached as Item No. 9. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff atten-
dance. 
Margin requirements. 
In a memorandum dated April 28, 1970, 
Mr. Partee commented on the current situation in the stock market as 
evaluated in an attached staff document. 
The staff concluded that there 
was no evidence to suggest that a rapid acceleration in either margin 
calls or forced liquidation of securities had thus far occurred, and 
that an immediate reduction in margin requirements would be of no direct 
benefit in reducing margin calls. 
Immediate action could be of some 
indirect benefit to the extent that it buoyed stock prices, but the 
result would be highly uncertain. 
The question of a reduction in margin 
requirements had been raised in a recent letter from the President of 
the New York Stock Exchange, the contents of which had apparently been 
leaked to the press. 
It was the view of the staff, however, that an orderly reduction 
in margin requirements might be desirable in the near future. 
Mr. Partee commented on several issues bearing on the question 
of a change in margin requirements. While a change should probably be 
made, its timing was a matter of policy. One point to be considered 
was the range within which margin requirements should appropriately be 

t 
' } ' > ' ) 
4/29/70 
-11-
maintained over a period of time. Possible psychological effects should 
also be considered, in particular public reaction if the Board should 
lower margin requirements on the heels of a publicized recommendation 
from the New York Stock Exchange. 
It did not appear to Mr. Partee that 
the situation was of such urgency that a change need be made immediately, 
and he suggested that certain other changes in the regulations might be 
considered at the same time as a reduction of the basic margin require-
ments . 
There ensued a general discussion of margin requirements as an 
instrument of selective credit control during which reference also was 
made to certain recent developments that might tend to exert a steadying 
effect on the stock market. 
It was the general view that the situation 
as of today was not such as to mandate an immediate change in margin 
requirements. 
However, it was understood that the Board and staff would 
continue to keep the situation under close review. 
Members of the staff other than Mr. Kenyon then withdrew from 
the meeting. 
Officer salaries. Upon recommendation by Governor Sherrill, 
the Board approved the payment of salaries to officers of the Board, 
retroactive to December 28, 1969, at the annual rates specified in an 
attachment to these minutes (Item No. 10). 
The meeting then adjourned.

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant 
to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve 
Regulation Y (12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by Brenton Banks, 
Inc., Des Moines, Iowa ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding 
company, for the Board
1s prior approval of the acquisition of 98 per cent 
of the voting shares of Northwest Brenton Bank and Trust Company, 
Urbandale, Iowa, a proposed new bank. 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
notice of receipt of the application to the Superintendent of the 

3 324 
- 2 -
Department of Banking for the State of Iowa and requested his views 
and recommendation. The Superintendent, having tentatively approved 
the chartering of the new bank with knowledge that it was proposed 
that the bank become a subsidiary of Applicant, did not submit comments 
to the Board on the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on February 19, 1970 (35 Federal Register 3190), which 
Provided an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
views with respect to the proposed acquisition. A copy of the application 
was forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
consideration. The time for filing comments and views has expired and 
all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources of the Applicant and the banks concerned, and the convenience 
and needs of the communities to be served, and finds that: 
Applicant, the second largest bank holding company and the 
third largest banking organization in Iowa, has 14 subsidiary banks 
With $156 million in deposits, which represent 
2.7 per cent of the total 
deposits for the State. 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1969, 
adjusted to reflect bank holding company formations and acquisitions 

-3-
approved by the Board to date.) One of Applicant's subsidiary banks 
has operated a limited-service office in Urbandale since 1959. Iowa 
banking i&tt© prohibit the continued operation of this branch in the event 
that any other bank is established with headquarters in the town. 
Applicant proposes to establish and acquire a new full-service bank 
in expanded quarters at the present location of its subsidiary's branch, 
and to discontinue operations of the latter. Consummation of the proposal 
would not eliminate present competition or foreclose potential competition, 
and it does not appear that it would adversely affect present or potential 
competitors in the area involved. 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
consummation of Applicant's proposal would not have an adverse effect 
on competition in any relevant area. The banking factors, as-applied 
fco the facts of record, are consistent with approval of the application. 
Consummation of the proposal would afford the Urbandale area the 
convenience of complete banking services, and that consideration weighs 
in favor of approval action. It is the Board's judgment that the 
Proposed transaction would be in the public interest, and that the 
aPplication should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, for the reasons set forth above, that 
S a i d application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisition 
s ° approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
^ay following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months after

the date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by

authority.

Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer.

for approval of acquisition of 80 per

St. Petersburg, Florida. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant 
to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve 
Regulation Y (12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by First Florida 
Bancorporation, Tampa, Florida ("Applicant"), a registered bank 
holding company, for the Board's prior approval of the acquisition 
of 80 per cent or more of the voting shares of Liberty National Bank 
of St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg, Florida ("Bank") 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
notice of receipt of the application to the Comptroller of the Currency 
and requested his views and recommendation. The Comptroller recommended 
approval of the application. 

1.328 
- 2 -
Notice of. receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on March 6, 1970 (35 Federal Register 4231), providing 
an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views with 
respect to the proposed transaction. A copy of the application was 
forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its consideration. 
The time for filing comments and views has expired and all those received 
have been considered by the Board, 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources of the Applicant and the banks concerned, and the convenience 
and needs of the communities to be served and finds that: 
Applicant presently controls 16 banks which hold deposits of 
$333 million, representing 2.9 per cent of total deposits held by 
Florida's commercial banks. Its share of State deposits would increase 
to 3 per cent as a result of the acquisition of Bank ($16 million deposits), 
and Applicant would remain the sixth largest banking organization in the 
State. There is no significant competition between Bank and Applicant's 
Present subsidiary banks, the nearest office of which is located in 
Tampa, 21 miles northeast of Bank. It does not appear that consummation 
o f this proposal would eliminate existing competition or foreclose 
significant potential competition, or that the viability or competitive 
effectiveness of any other bank would be adversely affected. 

19 
-2-
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse effect on com-
petition in any relevant market. The financial condition and management 
of Applicant's group and Bank are satisfactory, and the prospects for 
each appear favorable. Considerations concerning community convenience 
and needs weigh in favor of approval of the application, because of the 
expanded services that would be made available by Bank, one of the smallest 
banks in St. Petersburg. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest, and that the application 
should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, for the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisition 
so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months after 
the date of this Order unless such period is extended for good cause 
by the Board,or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant to 
delegated authority.

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by Dacotah Bank Holding Co., Aberdeen, 
South Dakota ("Applicant"), for the Board's prior approval of the 
acquisition of 63.36 per cent or more of the voting shares of Bank of 
Lemmon, Lemmon, South Dakota ("Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
Notice of receipt of the application to the Superintendent of Banks of 
State of South Dakota, and requested his views and recommendation, 
•^he Superintendent recommended approval of the application. 

1.331 
- 2 -
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the Federal 
Register on October 16, 1969 (34 Federal Register 16565), providing an 
opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views with respect 
to the proposal. A copy of the application was forwarded to the United 
States Department of Justice for its consideration. Time for filing 
comments and views has expired and all those received have been considered 
by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and finds 
that: 
Applicant, the third largest bank holding company and fourth 
largest banking organization in South Dakota, controls four banks with 
million in deposits, representing 2.4 per cent of State deposits. 
(Banking data are as of June 30, 1969, adjusted to reflect holding company 
formations and acquisitions approved by the Board to date.) 
Acquisition 
Bank ($7 million deposits) would not significantly increase Applicant's 
control of State deposits, or change its ranking in relation to other 
banking organizations in South Dakota. Bank is the smaller of two banks 
Lemmon (population 2,400), and the third largest of four banks located 
Within a 30 mile radius thereof. The closest of Applicant's present 

subsidiaries is located about 100 miles from Lemmon. It does not appear 
that present competition would be eliminated, or significant potential 
competition foreclosed, as a result of the proposed acquisition, or that 
there would be undue adverse effects on any competing bank. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse effect on com-
petition in any relevant area. Prospects of Bank would be enhanced by 
the proposal, and the Lemmon community would benefit from expanded 
services which Applicant proposes to institute at Bank; both of these 
considerations weigh in favor of approval of the application. It is the 
Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
interest, and that the application should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, for the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisition 
S o approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
d a y following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months after 
fche date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by

WASHINGTON, D. C a 
In the Matter of the Application of 
HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED, 
Columbus, Ohio, 
for approval of acquisition of 
80 per cent or more of the voting 
shares of The Bank of Wood County 
Company, Bowling Green, Ohio 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant 
to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve 
Regulation Y (12 CFR 222.3(a)), the application of Huntington 
Bancshares Incorporated, Columbus, Ohio ("Applicant"), a registered 
bank holding company, for the Board's prior approval of the acquisition 
of 80 per cent or more of the voting shares of The Bank of Wood 
County Company, Bowling Green, Ohio ("Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
written notice of receipt of the application to the Ohio Superintendent 

3 334 
-2-
of Banks and requested his views and recommendation4 
The Superintendent 
recommended approval of the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on March 10, 1970 (35 Federal Register 4312), 
providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application was 
forwarded to the Department of Justice for its consideration. Time 
for filing comments and views has expired and all those received have been 
considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect 
of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and finds 
that: 
Applicant controls four banks (26 offices) with total deposits 
of $505 million, representing 2.6 per cent of the total bank deposits 
in the State of Ohio. (All banking data are as of June 30, 1969, 
adjusted to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved 
by the Board to date.) Upon acquisition of Bank ($41 million deposits), 
Applicant
!s share of State deposits would increase to 2.8 per cent. 
Applicant has no subsidiary in Wood County, in which Bank is located; 
its closest subsidiary is located about 90 miles southeast of Bowling 

Green. Although Bank is the larger of two banks in Bowling Green, 
and the largest of 11 banks in Wood County, it has been conservatively 
operated, and affiliation with Applicant would likely increase its 
competitive effectiveness. Consummation of the proposed acquisition 
would not eliminate existing competition or foreclose significant 
potential competition, and would not have undue adverse effects on 
the viability or competitive effectiveness of any competing bank. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse effect on 
competition in any relevant area* The banking factors y as applied 
to the facts of record, are consistent with approval of the application, 
and considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
communities to be served lend some weight in support of approval. It 
is the Board*s judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the 
public interest, and that the application should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, for the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the action so 
approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months 
after the date of this Order, unless such time be extended for good

Dear Mr. Sullivan: 
This refers to your letters of April 6 and April 10, 
1970, regarding a letter of March 19, 1970, and attachments, 
you received from Mr. R . D. Wright, Vice Chairman of the Board 
of the Security Bank and Trust Company, Wharton, Texas, con-
cerning certain loans which he purchased from the bank in 
connection with the sale of the bank in May 1968. 
In the circumstances, it is believed appropriate 
that you set forth the facts in a letter to Mr. Wright, as 
you suggest, and there is attached a draft of such a letter 
which you may use for that purpose. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon

Wharton, Texas 
77488. 
Dear Mr. Wright: 
I am in receipt of your letter dated March 19, 1970, 
and am sorry to hear that you have a disagreement with the 
Internal Revenue Service concerning your 1968 personal income 
tax return. 
I am pleased to confirm the facts as evidenced by our 
bank examination of Security Bank and Trust dated January 20, 
1968, which was performed in conjunction with examiners of the 
Banking Department of the State of Texas, that the loans listed 
by you in the amount of $1,058,560.85 were considered to be of 
a nonbankable quality. It was our recommendation that the loans 
of a nonbankable quality should be removed from the assets of 
the bank. 
If our determination that the loans listed by you were 
of a nonbankable quality will assist in your discussions with 
the Internal Revenue Service, I am happy to furnish you this 
information. 
Sincerely,

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 
Dallas, Texas. 
75222 
Dear M r . Sullivan: 
This refers to your letter of July 10, 1969, forwarding a 
request from George Nokes, President of the Lake Air National Bank, 
Waco, Texas, for a ruling as to whether a bid for municipal deposit 
by a competitor, Trie Citizens National Bank of Waco, is consistent with 
Regulation Q. 
It appears that The Citizens National Bank, in a bid to become 
McClemian County depository, offered to pay the maximum amount of interest 
permitted by Regulation Q on funds placed with the bank and, among other 
things, to waive up to $6,000 interest on the County's road bonds already 
held by the bank. 
In 1S57, the Board ruled that granting a customer a low-interest 
or interest-free loan in return for the maintenance of a deposit account 
does not constitute a violation of Regulation Q (F.R.L.S. K 3150.40). 
Although waiver of interest on bonds is similar to charging no interest 
on a loan, the reasons underlying the ruling as to interest on loans are 
not present in the case of waiving interest on bonds. The rulings involving 
loans are to a. great extent based upon the administrative difficulty in 
assessing the proper interest rate on a loan and the undue interference 
with the discretion of bank officers that would be involved if the contrary 
position were adopted. This difficulty and interference is not involved 
in the waiver of bond interest, because the interest rate on the bond has 
already been fixed. 
In the Board's judgment, the situation is similar to a rebate 
on a loan, which in 1965 it: ruled would constitute a payment of interest 
in violation of Regulation Q where the rebate was conditional on 
maintenance by the borrower of a checking account with the bank 
(F.R.L.S. V 3150.80). Although no cash or credit is given to the County 
by the waiver of interest on the bonds, the effect is exactly the same 
as in the case of a rebate. Interest earned is foregone because a 
deposit account is maintained in the bank. 

1.343 
M r , Thomas R . Sullivan 
-2-
Accordingly, the Board considers that the waiver of interest 
on the County road bonds would constitute an indirect payment of interest 
to the depositor as compensation .for the use of the County's funds and 
that:, if Citizens National does waive interest on the bonds (whether by 
forwarding the interest coupons to the paying agent for cancellation or 
by destroying them), it would be acting in violation of Regulation Q* 
The Comptroller of the Currency is being asked to inform The 
Citizens National Bank of the substance of this letter and to take 
appropriate action to assure that future bids by the bank are consistent 
with the views expressed herein. We regret the delay in responding to 
your letter and M r , Nolces request. However, in view of our understanding 
that bidding for municipal deposits is on an annual basis, we trust that 
the delay has not resulted in any substantial hardship or inconvenience. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon

Dear Mr. Comptroller: 
Enclosed is a copy of a letter expressing the Board's view 
that waiver by a member bank of interest on a bond issued by a depositor 
constitutes payment by the bank of interest on the depositor's account 
with the bank. 
It would be appreciated if you would take such action as you 
may deem appropriate to assure that the member national bank involved is 
informed of the Board's position and acts consistently therewith in its 
future bids for municipal deposits. 
Very truly yours,
