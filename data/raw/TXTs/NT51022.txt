Members of the staff who had been present only for the special 
briefing then withdrew. 
Consent calendar. Pursuant to the recommendation of the Office 
of Executive Director in a memorandum of January 31, 1973, the Board 
unanimously approved (1) the formation of a staff committee, to be called 
the Federal Reserve Credit Committee, which would meet regularly to 
consider current and prospective developments at the discount window; 
(2) the designation of committee members; and (3) a letter to the Presi-
dents of all Federal Reserve Banks regarding the committee. A copy of 
the letter sent to the Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 1.

As recommended in a staff memorandum of February 1, 1973, the 
Board unanimously approved a letter to the Office of Management and 
Budget regarding draft legislation proposed by the Department of Justice 
that would revise the Federal criminal laws of the United States. A copy 
of the letter is attached as Item No. 2. 
Pursuant to a recommendation in a memorandum from the Division 
of Supervision and Regulation dated February 1, 1973, the Board unanimously 
denied a request by Mr. Richard T„ Tench of Portland, Oregon, for an 
individual exception to the application of the same-day substitution rule 
in Regulation T, Credit by Brokers and Dealers. A copy of the letter sent 
to Mr. Tench is attached as Item No. 3. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of The Andover 
Bank, Andover, Ohio, to issue capital notes. A copy of the letter sent 
to the applicant is attached as Item No. 4. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of Peninsular 
Holding Corporation of Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan, to become a 
bank holding company through acquisition of shares of the successor by 
merger to Union Bank and Trust Company (National Association), also in 
Grand Rapids, and authorized issuance of an order reflecting that decision. 
A copy of the order is attached as Item No. 5. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of First National 
City Bank, New York, New York, for an extension of time within which to 
acquire shares of Banco Inter-Unido, Luanda, Angola, at a cost higher 

a 9 3

than that for which consent had previously been granted. A copy of 
the letter sent to the applicant is attached as It em No. 6. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of Industrial 
National Corporation, Providence, Rhode Island, a bank holding company, 
to purchase shares of Industrial International Leasing Limited, Toronto, 
Canada. A copy of the letter sent to the applicant is attached as 
Item No. 7. 
The Board unanimously approved, for transmittal to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, a report on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed merger of Continental Bank and Bank of Texas, 
both in Houston, Texas. The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the merger of Continental Bank and 
Bank of Texas, both in Houston, Texas, would eliminate 
a considerable amount of existing and potential competi-
tion. Overall, the effect on competition would be slightly 
adverse. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Board policy actions. With a memorandum dated January 23, 1973, 
the Office of the Secretary submitted a draft of the record of policy 
actions taken by the Board in 1972, except those relating to the discount 
rate, which were to be submitted at a later date. The policy record entries, 
in the form approved by the Board, would be published in the Annual Report 
for 1972. 
After a discussion during which a change in language in one entry 
was agreed upon, the Board unanimously approved the record of policy actions 
for inclusion in the Annual Report. 

2/6/73 
System membership. Under the provisions of Regulation H, 
Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System, 
any State bank could withdraw from System membership six months after 
written notice had been filed with the Board; the Board could waive 
such notice in any individual case. However, it had long been Board 
policy to grant all such waivers and the authority to grant waivers 
had been delegated to the Federal Reserve Banks. 
On February 1, 1973, the Board deferred for further consideration 
a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that henceforth all 
requests for six-month waivers be forwarded to the Board for action. The 
Reserve Bank believed that the granting of such waivers might be incon-
sistent with recent Board statements expressing concern regarding declining 
System membership. The Reserve Bank's proposal had been prompted by the 
application of Wisconsin Marine Bank, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a holding 
company subsidiary, for waiver of the six-month waiting period. In a 
memorandum dated January 26, 1973, the Division of Supervision and Regu-
lation recommended that the Reserve Banks continue to process waiver appli-
cations under delegated authority. 
During today's discussion general support developed for the 
Reserve Bank's proposal. In light of the growing concern within the 
Board regarding banks withdrawing from the System, it was believed that a 
decision to approve waivers of the six-month waiting period only in 
special instances would emphasize the Board's concern with respect to 

395 
2/6/73 
-6-
the membership problem. It was therefore understood that a statement 
would be prepared for the Board's consideration that would (1) express 
the Board's concern regarding withdrawals from the System; and (2) 
announce that in the future, waivers of the six-month waiting period 
would require Board approval and would be granted only in special circum-
stances . 
With regard to the Wisconsin Marine Bank application, it was 
agreed that the Board's views regarding System membership would be 
discussed with Wisconsin Marine. However, if the bank maintained its 
desire to withdraw from the System, the six-month waiver was to be granted. 
Grandfather rights: Wasatch National. Pursuant to the recommen-
dations of the Division of Supervision and Regulation, the Banking Markets 
Section, and the Legal Division in memoranda dated January 22 and 26, 1973, 
the Board agreed that Wasatch National, Inc., Ogden, Utah, was not a 
bank holding company and authorized issuance of a determination to that 
effect. Other related documentation included a memorandum dated January 31, 
1973, from the Legal Division. A copy of the determination subsequently 
issued is attached as Item No. 8. A copy of the letter sent to Wasatch 
National is attached as Item No. 9. 
NOW accounts. On January 8, 1973, it was understood that the 
Board would delay further any action with respect to the use of negotiable 
orders of withdrawal (NOW's) by Massachusetts mutual savings banks pending 
action by Massachusetts State authorities. 

J96 
2/6/73 
-7-
At today's meeting it was reported that the Massachusetts 
Bankers Association had requested the Board's assistance in obtaining 
legislation to bring Massachusetts mutual savings banks under Federal 
control. In that light it was noted that the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Bank Regulation had discussed possible legislation that 
would require mutual savings banks to be members of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. 
The Massachusetts Bankers Association also had requested that 
the Board continue to defer any action with respect to the Massachusetts 
situation. It was therefore understood that the Coordinating Committee 
would continue to consider possible legislation, but that the Board 
would continue to delay action. 
Governor Sheehan asked for an executive session of the Board 
and all members of the staff withdrew. 
Officers' salaries. Governor Sheehan then presented to the 
Board his recommendations for official appointments, title changes, and 
salary increases for the Board's official staff, as described in his 
memorandum of February 1, 1973 (a copy of this memorandum has been 
placed in the Secretary's confidential file). He proposed that the 
salary increases be made retroactive to the beginning of the first pay 
period in 1973, to accord in timing with the general pay increase given 
the non-officer staff.

2/6/73

After discussion, the Board voted to affirm a policy of 
paying a number of its key officers in excess of the present salary 
ceiling applicable to graded employees in the Civil Service, and a 
few of its key executives in excess of Level IV in the Federal exec-
utive structure but below the salaries of Board members. 
Board members then exchanged views as to the qualifications 
of and appropriate salary changes for members of the official staff. 
There was a consensus that a number of proposed salary actions warranted 
revision. Accordingly, the Board voted to approve the salary changes 
and official appointments recommended by Governor Sheehan, subject to 
revision in the light of the changes suggested at this meeting. Governor 
Sheehan, however, was authorized to make whatever adjustments he deemed 
wise in the salary revisions suggested by the Board members, after 
consultation with the Executive Director concerning the staff consid-
erations that might need to be taken into account. A copy of the list 
of officers' salaries for 1973 as finally approved is attached as 
Item No. 10. 
The Board also approved the following three official staff 
appointments and one title change; 
1. Griffith L. Garwood, Adviser, Division of Supervision 
and Regulation. 
2. John N. Nicoll, Assistant General Counsel, Legal 
Division. 
3. Andrew F. Oehmann, Special Assistant to the General 
Counsel.

The meeting then adjourned.

Mi:. Wilfred 11, Rommel 
"Assistant Director lor Legislative Reference 
Office of Management arid Budget 
Washing Lor,, D. C. 20503 
Dear Mr, Rommel; 
This is in response to Mr. Skidmore's request of January 17, 
1973 
for the views of C h e Board of Governors on the Department of 
Juslice Bralt Revision of Title 18 of the United States Code. 
The dralt revision raises no policy issues of concern to the 
Barrel of Governors nor would such proposed legislation. have any pro-
joctea budgetary or nunnpower impact upon uhe Federal keserve System, 
Portions of the proposed draft which are relevant to the 
Board would: 
1. Transfer §§ 212, and 213 from Title 18 to Title 12 
bur apparently remain substantively intact. 
(Sections 212 
and 213 basically prohibit bribes to bank examiners.) 
Sec-
tions proscribing conduct outside of Title 18 are made mis-
clcmeinor sections by i.he proposal. H a s would not affect 
212 and 
since they now carry misdemeanor penalties 
only. 
It: is recommended that language be added to §§ 212 and 
213" <-o cJearlv bring bank holding companies within the purview 
of the ?agislauion by inserting the words "or a registered 
bank holding company" in §§ 212 and 213, 
2. Replace the proscriptions of IS U.3.C. §S 21/: and 215 
b- proposed g 1751. 
Section 214 prohibits the giving or re-
roipt of any ice in connection with an extension of civdrt by 
a Federal Reserve bank unless disclosure of such receipt: or 
payment is made. 
Section 215 generally proscribes the receipt 
of" anv fee by a bank official in return for procuring a loan. 
Section 1751' prohibits commercial bribery. 
Thus proposee S 1 OJ. 
does not c o v e r , nor doer it purport to cover, tne m a n u a u n y 
disclosure requirements oi: § 2 J4« 
It is reconrmended tnat: <; > w

also be. moved to Title 12. Section 1751. has been drafted 
broadly to include desirable changes, namely, to cover bank 
holding company situations and situations pertaining to "any 
transaction" in relation to the affairs of an employer, which 
gives much more extensive coverage than § 215. 
3. Replace 10 U,S,C. 334 by § 1743. Section 334 proscribes 
inter alia putting into circulation Federal Reserve nct.es with-
out complying with applicable law. Section 1743 proscribes know-
ingly issuing a "writing" (e.g., a Federal Reserve note) with 
intent to deceive or harm the government or another person. 
The 
added requirements of § 1/43 will only unnecessarily complicate 
the law relating to unauthorized issuance of money. 
It is recom-
mended that a subsection be added to § 1743 reflecting the present 
proscriptions of: § 334 relating to Federal Reserve notes, 
4. Replace 13 IJ.S.C. §§ 655 and 656 by § 1731, Section 655 
proscribes theft of. bar.I: funds by bank examiners and € 656 pro-
sorites the ft r and misapplications of bank funds by bank officers. 
Section 1733 as presently drafted appears an adequate substitute, 
for 
655 and 656; however, it is reecptaended that bank holding 
companies be covered by § 17.31» 
5. Replace IS U.S.C, 1004 Ify § 1743. Section 1004 pro-
scribes the certification of checks before a bank deposit has 
been made. Section 1743 merely proscribes the issuance of any 
writing without authority whereas § 1004 itself defines a sub-
stantive standard not related to deception or harm. 
It is recom-
mended that § 1004 be moved to Title 12 and retained. 
6. Replace 13 U.S.C. 1005 by §§ 1741 and 1743. Section 1005 
proscribes false entries on the books of member banks (made 
applicable to bank holding companies by § 8 of the BHCA) and the 
issuance of notes, etc., by personnel of Federal Reserve banks 
and member banks vri thout authority. Section 1741 covering forgery 
or counterfeiting is broad enough to proscribe false entries on 
lhe books of banking institutions. 
The section should be made 
applicable to bank, holding companies (to cover the present $ 8 
of the 3il!OA). Section 1743 appears adequate to cover the remain-
ing proscriptions of. § 1005. It is recommended that the. words 
"including a national credit, institution" be inserted after the 
wo r d s 1' J.' in a ne i a ] i n s t i tu tio n'1 in § ( b ) (1) (A ) , 

403 
Mr. Wilfred H. Rommel 
-3-
7. Replace 18 U.S.C. 1014 by § 1343. Section 1014 
proscribes the willful overvaluing of property for the 
purpose of influencing any action of: a Reserve bank. Sec-
tion 1343 proscribes f lse statements in "governmental" 
matters and will .cover that ground now covered by § 1014. 
The Board has appreciated the opportunity to comment upon the 
proposed draft revision.

Mr. Richard T. Tench 
intended to facilitate, a reduction of margin credit outstanding (which 
v?as then in excess of. $7 billion) and to improve the quality of margin 
credit. 
The Board has considered your contention that the imposition 
of these restrictions on stock owned prior to the effective date of the 
regulation is unconstitutional. 
The Board believes that the actions 
it has taken in adjusting the - same-day substitution rule (or, analogously, 
actions it takes when it raises margin requirements) are witbun the 
Congressional mandate that the Board prevent the excessive use of secu-
rities credit. 
While the Board has denied your request for a "waiver", it 
has been noted that your letters raise questions with respectvto alleged 
improper conduct by a brokerage firm. Accordingly, wc have taken the 
liberty of forwarding the correspondence to the S.E.C. which has juris-
diction in such and other matters. 
Very truly your/,

Board of Directors 
The Andover Sank 
Andover, Ohio 
Gentlemen: 
Pursuant to section 217.1(f)(3)(i) of Regulation Q and 
section 204.1(f)(3)(i) of Regulation D, the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System approves the issuance of up to y200,0GU 
in subordinated capital notes by The Andover Bank, Andover, Ohio, 
in the form submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. 
This approval is given on the condition that the capital notes 
cannot: be called for redemption prior to maturity without the 
approval of the Federal Reserve Bank. Approval is granted with 
the understanding that the sale of these capital notes will be 
consummated within six-months from the date of this letter. It 
is further understood that any advertising with respect to the 
obligations will, in addition to being in compliance with the pro-
visions of section 217.6 of Regulation Q, clearly distinguish the 
nature of the obligation from a deposit, including by secting forth 
in bold face type that the obligation is subordinated to the claims 
of depositors and not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. 
Very truly yours,

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PENINSULAR HOLDING CORPORATION OF MICHIGAN 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
Peninsular Holding Corporation of Michigan, Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, has applied for the Board's approval under 
§ 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) 
of formation of a bank holding company through acquisition of 
100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' qualifying 
shares) of the successor by merger to Union Bank and Trust 
Company (National Association), Grand Rapids, Michigan ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity 
for interested persons to submit comments and views, has been 
given in accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for 
filing comments and views has expired, and the Board has con-
sidered the application and all comments received in light 
of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant is a nonoperating company, recently formed 
for the purpose of acquiring Bank ($286.9 million deposits). 
(Banking data are as of June 30, 1972.) Bank is the second 
largest in Kent County holding 21.9 per cent of the deposits 
in commercial banks in that county; the largest bank holds 
49.3 per cent of county deposits. Consummation of the proposal 
would have no adverse effects on the other banks in the area. 
Since Applicant has no present operations or subsidiaries, it 
appears that, consummation of the proposal would not significantly

2/6/73

r 
4 o 8 
-2-
affect existing or potential competition. Competitive con-
siderations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Applicant's management is capable; its financial 
condition is dependent on that of Bank which is deemed to 
be satisfactory. Prospects for both Applicant and Bank are 
favorable particularly in view of Applicant's commitment 
to contribute $4 million to the equity capital accounts of 
Bank within ninety days of the effective date of this Order 
and to inject an additional $1 million in equity capital 
iuto Bank by June 30, 1974. Banking factors are therefore 
consistent with approval of the application. Considerations 
relating to the convenience and needs of the community are 
also consistent with approval of the application. It is 
the Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the 
Public interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is 
aPproved for the reasons summarized above. The transaction 
shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
day following the effective date of this Order or (b) later 
than three months after the effective date of this Order, 

-3 
unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated 
authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
2/6/73 
WASATCH NATIONAL, INC. 
"Grandfather" Privileges 
There appeared in the Federal Register of October 19, 1972, 
a notice that the Board would be reviewing, pursuant to section 4(a)(2) 
of the Bank Holding Company Act (the "Act") (12 U.S.C. 1843(a)(2)), the 
aonbanking activities of Wasatch National, Inc., Ogden, Utah ("Wasatch") 
that the company engaged in on, and continuously since, June 30, 1968 
(37 F.R. 22414). 
N 
The proposed review of "grandfather" privileges of Wasatch 
was based on the assumption, derived from the original registration stat 
ment of Wasatch, that Wasatch became a bank holding company with respect 
to Commercial Security Bank, Ogden, Utah ("CSB"), on December 31, 19/0, 
as a result of enactment of the 1970 Amendments to the Act. Wasatch 
amended its registration statement in November, 1972, claiming to be a 
bank holding company with respect to both CSB and Idaho Bank & Trust 
Company, PocateJ.lo, Idaho ("IB&T"). 
The time given for filing comments, views or requests for a 
hearing on this matter has expired. After examining the facts and views 
presented regarding the status of Wasatch under the Act, the Board has 
concluded, for the reasons summarized below, that the proposed review 
of "grandfather" privileges of Wasatch is moot. 
On December 31, 1.970, Wasatch owned 13.99 per cent of the share 
of. CSB and 4.23 per cent of the sharers of IB&T. 
(Wasatch is the successo 
to Mutual Supply Company by statutory merger consummated in 1971: for the 
purposes or the Board's consideration of this matter, Wasatch and its 

413 
-2-
predecessor were treated as the same company.) On the same date, additional 
shares of each of the two banks were owned, controlled, or voted by officers, 
directors, and shareholders of Wasatch. On the basis of the facts before 
the Board, it concluded that attribution of these share holdings of indivi-
duals to Wasatch was not warranted and that, on December 31, 1970, Wasatch 
did not control the election of a majority of the directors of either bank. 
Accordingly, the Board concluded that Wasatch is not a "company covered in 
1970" within the meaning of § 2(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1841(b)). 
On April 17, 1972, Commercial Security Bancorporation ("Eancor-
poration") received Board approval, pursuant to delegated authority, to 
acquire substantially all the shares of the successor by merger to CSB. 
Consummation of the proposal involved the exchange by Wasatch of its shares 
cf CSB for shares of Bancorporation. According to information furnished 
to the Board, at the present time Wasatch owns, controls, or holds with 
power to vote approximately 14 per cent of the shares of Bancorporation 
and less than 5 per cent of the shares of IBiT. On this basis, the Board 
concluded that Wasatch does not contro.1 Bancorporation or I.B&T within the 
meaning of §§ 2(a)(2)(A) or 2(a)(2)(B) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2)). 
Accordingly, the Board regards Wasatch as not being a bank holding company 
at the present time.
