Item No. 
<3!! i 
Application to establish foreign branch (Item No. 4). There 
had been distributed a memorandum from the Division of Examinations 
dated May 17, 1968, regarding the application of The First Pennsyl-
vania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for per-
? vt i..'C...! 
mission to establish a branch in London, England. This would be the 
bank's first foreign branch. 
The memorandum noted that the last two examinations of the 
bank had revealed problems in the area of audit and controls. While 
the problems had not reached serious proportions, Vice President 
Campbell of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had indicated 
that if there was no major change in the attitude of senior management 
the bank the Reserve Bank would eventually have to make an issue 
the matter. The president of the bank, who had resisted major 
P°licy changes, was due for retirement shortly, and no other officer 

5/24/68 
-4-
was in a position at this point to make the necessary adjustments. 
However, a vice president who was cognizant of the audit and control 
problems had initiated discussions with Vice President Campbell. In 
view of this, Mr. Campbell thought the best time to pursue the matter 
further would be after a new president had been selected. 
In these circumstances, and in view of the special problems 
associated with overseas operations, a paragraph had been included in 
the proposed letter of approval specifying the need to make adequate 
Provision for audit and controls in operating the foreign branch. 
Governor Brimmer said he was reluctant to see the Board 
approve the application without obtaining a firm indication about 
the manner in which the audit and control problem would be handled. 
At the least, he would want to have the relevant paragraph in the 
letter as strong as possible. 
There followed several suggestions for possible changes in 
the wording of the paragraph in question, after which Governor 
Robertson expressed the view that the import of the language in the 
^raft letter would be clear to the bank. He suggested, however, that 
ctle Re serve Bank be requested to follow the situation closely. Gover-
n°r Brimmer proposed that the Division of Examinations inform Vice 
Resident Campbell of the Board's concern, and Mr. Solomon observed 
ttlat Mr. Campbell was aggressive in pursuing such matters.

After further discussion reflecting agreement with the fore-
going procedural suggestions, unanimous approval was given to the 
letter as drafted. A copy is attached as Item No. 4. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller 
of the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
consolidation of Commonwealth National Bank of San Francisco and First 
San Francisco Bank, both of San Francisco, California, was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller. The conclusion read 
as follows: 
Although Commonwealth National Bank of San Francisco 
and First San Francisco Bank are relatively small and rel-
atively new, consummation of the proposed consolidation 
would eliminate present and potential competition between 
the two banks, which are serving essentially the same 
geographic and economic market. The overall effect of 
the consolidation would be adverse. 
Proposed activity of State member bank (Item No. 5). There 
had been distributed a draft of letter to Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, 
Angeles, California, in reply to a request for the Board's opinion 
regarding whether a proposed transaction by Union Bank, Los Angeles, 
( a State member bank), would violate the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 24 
(section 5136 of the Revised Statutes, paragraph seventh). Union Bank 
Pr°Posed, in brief, to solicit institutional investors to participate 
the permanent financing of the construction of a hotel and to issue 
Participations to such investors. The statute in question provided 
at a national bank 
. . shall not underwrite any issue of securities 

I S I 
5/24/68 
-6-
or stock . . .". The limitation was made applicable to State member 
banks by section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act. 
In the draft letter it was noted that bank participation in 
the making of large loans was a long-established practice. When a 
relatively small number of institutions were approached by a "lead" 
bank (such as Union) with this in mind, the situation did not fall 
within the scope of underwriting of securities, as that term was used 
by 
Congress in 12 U.S.C. 24. The letter pointed out, however, that 
consideration might be given to the possible relevance of sec-
tion 21(a)(1) of the Banking Act of 1933, which was penal in nature, 
and the effect of which was to prohibit any firm "engaged in the busi-
ness of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing, at wholesale 
o r retail, or through syndicate participation, . . . notes, or other 
securities . . . " from engaging at the same time in the business of 
banking. The letter would state that, while a forceful argument 
c°uld be made that that section was not intended to prohibit trans-
itions of the kind here involved, the Board was not in a position 
to make authoritative interpretations of penal statutes. 
Governor Maisel suggested certain changes in the letter for 
Ratification purposes, and unanimous approval was then given to a 
letter in the form attached as Item No. 5. 
Report on S. 5 (Item No. 6). The Board had received a request 
from the Bureau of the Budget for its views with respect to enrolled 
b i l 1 S. 5 i the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 

1888

Unanimous approval was given to a letter to the Bureau setting 
forth the Board's recommendation that the bill be approved by the 
President. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 6. 
Mr. Solomon then discussed briefly the plans of the Board's 
staff for implementing the applicable provisions of the bill and 
stated that a memorandum would be forthcoming outlining the program 
in detail. 
Assistance for Central Bank of Tanzania. Reference was made 
to the fact that Murray Altmann of the Board's staff planned to return 
within the next few months from his post as an adviser to the Central 
Bank of Tanzania. It was understood that the Division of International 
Finance would attempt to locate a replacement for Mr. Altmann, a 
request to that effect having been received from the foreign central 
bank, and report back to the Board on any candidates who might be 
considered. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland and Kenyon 
1 ; 
then withdrew. 
Bank supervision. Governor Brimmer called attention to arti-
cles in the press based on interviews with various parties, including 
Board members, presently attending the ABA Monetary Conference in 
Puerto Rico, regarding problems posed by differences in policies 
followed by the respective bank supervisory authorities. After some 
discussion of the articles in question, Governor Maisel suggested that 
:5 ;< • •'.

the Board set aside several meetings to review outstanding Board inter-
pretations that were at variance with those of the Comptroller of the 
Currency or had otherwise been the subject of criticism from the bank-
ing industry, the purpose being to reexamine the issues involved and 
irill . 
: . 
determine whether any change of position was warranted. Governor 
Robertson agreed that it would be appropriate for the staff to identify 
the issues so that Board members could study them and formulate their 
views. 
The meeting then adjourned.

I O n of 12 U.S.C. 24, you argue that: (1) The Securities Act of 1933 

1895 
Jerome F. Prewoznik, Esq. 
-2-
draws a clear distinction between "issuers" and "underwriters", that it 
is implicit in that distinction that one entity cannot be both issuer 
and underwriter of the same security in a given transaction, and that 
his distinction should be applied in interpreting the quoted provision 
1 2 U.S.C. 24; (2) within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, 
underwriting is confined to "distribution", which is to be regarded as 
synonymous with "public offering", and this factor should be carried 
over in construing the term "underwriting" as used in 12 U.S.C. 24; and 
w ) it is "virtually axiomatic" that "the solicitation by a bank of loan 
Participations from other sophisticated lending institutions is an act 
1thin the general sphere of commercial banking, as distinguished from 
lnvestment banking, and does not constitute underwriting the sale of any 
securities.11 
tfC', II ; 1 
It is a long-established practice for a number of banks to 
Participate in making large loans. When a relatively small number of 
nstitutions are approached by the "lead" bank with this in mind, in 
® Board's opinion the situation does not fall within the scope of 
^n erwriting of securities, as that term was used by Congress in 
24 (Seventh). Transactions of that nature do not have the
