The Board approved unanimously the application of Jacob 
Schmidt Company and American Bancorporation, Inc., both of St. Paul, 
Minnesota, to acquire indirect and direct ownership of shares of Lake 
City State Bank, Lake City, Minnesota, and authorized the issuance of 
an order reflecting this decision. A copy of the order is attached as 
Item No. 2. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Adjustment of salary schedule. With a memorandum of Decem-
ber 30, 1971, the Office of Executive Director submitted a recommenda-
tion by the Division of Personnel Administration for an adjustment in 
the Board's salary schedule for other than officers corresponding to 
the structural changes approved by the President on December 22, 1971, 
for salaries of certain Federal employees. The proposed revision was 
in accord with the 1972 budget submission as generally approved by the 
Board on December 20. 
The Board unanimously approved the revised schedule. A copy 
of the Division's memorandum is attached as Item No. 3. 
Chairman Burns then entered the room, accompanied by 
Mr. Holland, Executive Director. 
Financial review. The research staff then presented a review 
of financial markets and developments with respect to foreign curren-
cies. Copies of the statistical charts and tables prepared for the 
purpose of today's review have been placed in the Board's files, 
along with copies of the individual briefings.

Governor Maisel joined the meeting during the review, and at 
its conclusion all members of the staff withdrew except Messrs. 
Holland, Melnicoff, Smith, Altmann, Broida, Partee, Axilrod, Chase, 
and Bryant. 
Chairman Burns raised a question about the extent to which 
Federal Open Market Committee projections and other confidential 
material were discussed at Board briefings and the possible desir-
ability of limiting staff attendance at such presentations in the 
interest of maintaining the greatest degree of confidentiality. After 
discussion, Mr. Holland was requested to consult with Messrs. Partee, 
Axilrod, and others to determine what might be done through closer 
monitoring of the content of briefings or other restrictions to accom-
plish the objective mentioned by the Chairman. 
Appropriate officers and staff then entered the room to assist 
the Board in its consideration of the following topic, including 
Mr. Leavitt, Deputy Director, Division of Supervision and Regulation, 
and Program Director for Banking Structure. 
Delegation of authority. In a memorandum of December 16, 1971, 
Messrs. Holland and Leavitt reviewed the impact of the greatly 
increased volume of bank holding company and merger applications on 
the time needed for processing. Cases that the staff had been unable 
to handle within the established 90-day schedule had increased from 
15 per cent in May 1971 to 52 per cent in December. The memorandum 

1/4/72 
-4-
cited the persistent underlying causes of delay and discussed the 
merits of taking the following steps, which were recommended: 
1. Delegate to the Reserve Banks authority to approve acqui-
sitions of stock by holding companies in cases of rights 
offering. In this connection the application should be 
a simple letter request. 
2. Delegate to the Reserve Banks authority to approve mer-
gers and membership applications incident to Reserve 
Bank action on one-bank holding company formations dele-
gated to the Reserve Banks as of September 1, 1971. 
3. Delegate to the Reserve Banks authority to approve acqui-
sitions of de novo banks by holding companies subject to 
the following guidelines: 
A. The general condition of the holding company and its 
bank subsidiaries is satisfactory. 
B. The holding company has either (1) a proven record 
of providing special services, management, capital 
funds when needed, and general guidance to its sub-
sidiary banks, or (2) in the case of a relatively 
new company, the Reserve Bank is satisfied that the 
company has the potential to provide the above ser-
vices. 
C. Bank subsidiaries of the holding company do not hold 
in the aggregate more than 25 per cent of the deposits 
in the relevant market area. 
4. Streamline procedures on applications under section 3 of 
the Bank Holding Company Act by reducing duplication of 
effort at the Reserve Bank and Board staff levels, and 
delegate authority to approve some applications to the 
Program Director for Banking Structure. 
Governor Robertson stated that he would vote favorably on the 
firs t and second recommendations, but would support the third only if 
the share of the relevant market area specified in (C) was reduced to 

7 
1/4/72 
-5-
15 or 20 per cent. He would oppose the fourth recommendation because 
he believed that the consent calendar procedure now followed worked 
well and was not burdensome in terms of time. 
Governor Robertson then withdrew. 
Governors Mitchell, Daane, and Maisel expressed agreement with 
the position Governor Robertson had outlined, as did Governor Brimmer, 
who spoke also in favor of an additional guideline in the third recom-
mendation, to be related to the total of State deposits. In the 
absence of such a limitation, it might be possible for a bank holding 
company to pre-empt State-wide sites in locations in which it had no 
current market share. 
The continuing discussion turned to the fourth recommendation. 
The streamlined procedures contemplated that the Board's staff would 
use a check list to determine whether the Reserve Bank's analysis 
needed to be supplemented. It was acknowledged that uniformity of 
analysis would suffer, and that it would be necessary to make contin-
uous efforts to help the Reserve Banks improve the quality of their 
memoranda. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it could not realis-
tically be assumed that the Reserve Banks would Improve the quality 
i 
of their analysis to the standard required by the Board. He did not 
believe that the Board should agree to procedures that were expected 
to be insufficient in some cases. He noted that, while the delegation 
proposed in the fourth recommendation would apply only to certain 

6 
1/4/72 
-6-
section 3 applications, the staff had indicated that over the longer 
term it would be desirable also to delegate to the Reserve Banks 
authority to approve the simpler merger and section 3(a)(3) applica-
tions, and ultimately even certain section 4(c)(8) acquisitions. In 
his view, not even the first step should be taken toward delegating 
merger decisions, the authority for which was vested in the Board. He 
was alarmed at the prospect of having thirteen separate decision-
making units, when there was already too much diversity within the 
System. Moreover, he believed that any necessary additions to staff 
should be concentrated at the Board, where any available economies of 
scale could be achieved better than at the Reserve Banks. 
Comments by other members of the Board indicated a view that 
further delegation was probably the road that had to be traveled, but 
that it might be expected that quality of analysis could be improved 
through coordination. However, the possible eventual steps mentioned 
by the staff should not be undertaken until both the Board and the 
Reserve Banks were ready for them. 
Chairman Burns stated that, whereas the staff memorandum had 
centered upon the difficulty of adhering to the 90-day schedule for 
processing all but the most troublesome cases, he had not abandoned 
the goal of a 75-day rule. He realized that the staff was making a 
strong effort to improve processing time, which the present delega-
tions would promote, but he requested that a schedule be developed for 

7 
1/4/72 
-7-
moving to a 75-day rule, preferably by mid-1972. If that meant hiring 
more people, the Board would have to consider that possibility. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Board unanimously 
approved the first three recommendations, with specification of 20 per 
cent rather than 25 per cent of relevant market area in recommendation 
3(C), and with the understanding that a fourth guideline with respect 
to percentage of State deposits would be worked out with Governors 
Mitchell and Brimmer. This action was implemented through amendments 
to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority, effective with 
respect to applications received by the Reserve Banks after January 21, 
1972, and through a letter of instructions to the Federal Reserve 
Banks. A copy of the notice sent to the Federal Register regarding 
the amendments is attached as Item No. 4, along with a copy of the 
related press release; a copy of the letter of instructions to the 
Federal Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 5. 
The meeting then adjourned. 

FEDERAL RESERVE SVS^EM 
Item No. 1 
1/4/72 
BANCOHIO CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
BancOhio Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, a bank holding company 
within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for 
the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C, 1842(a)(3)) 
to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors1 qualifying 
shares) of The Community National Bank, Loveland, Ohio ("Bank"), a pro-
posed new bank. 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
and views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
all comments received in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant, the second largest banking organization in Ohio, 
controls 29 banks with aggregate deposits of $1.6 billion, representing 
7.3 per cent of total commercial bank deposits in the State. (All 
banking data are as of June 30, 1971 and reflect holding company 
formations and acquisitions approved through November 30, 1971.) 
Bank will be located in the town of Loveland which is part 
the Cincinnati banking market. The banking needs of the community 
have been 3erved since 1958 by a branch of a bank headquartered in 
Milford. Because Loveland is located in three counties, Bank will 
have the future possibility of branching into these counties. Applicant 
has no subsidiaries in these counties and the nearest office of a 

subsidiary, located 30 miles from Bank, draws no business from Loveland. 
Since Bank is a new Bank, approval of the acquisition would not result 
in the elimination of existing competition nor in the foreclosure of 
future competition. Based on the record before it, the Board concludes 
that consummation of the proposed acquisition would not adversely 
affect competition in any relevant area. In fact, competition may be 
stimulated by the provision of a new banking alternative in the area. 
The financial and managerial resources and prospects of 
Applicant, its subsidiary banks, and Bank are regarded as satisfactory 
and these considerations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Applicant has stated that citizens of Loveland were seeking additional 
banking facilities. It appears that residents and businessmen would 
benefit from an additional banking source and hence considerations 
related to convenience and needs of the community favor approval of 
the application. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed acqui-
sition would be in the public interest and that the application should 
be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order 
o r (b) later than three months after the dar.e of this Order; and 
(c) The Community National Bank, Loveland, Ohio, shall b-i opened for 
business not later than six months after the date of this Order. 

Each of the periods described in (b) and (c) may be extended for good 
cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland pursuant 
to delegated authority.

Item No. 
1/4/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
JACOB SCHMIDT COMPANY AND AMERICAN BANCORPORATION, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Jacob Schmidt Company and American Bancorporation, Inc., 
both of St, Paul, Minnesota (hereinafter jointly referred to as 
"Applicant"), are bank holding companies within the meaning of the 
Bank Holding Company Act and have applied for the Board's approval 
under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) for American 
Bancorporation to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares (less 
directors' qualifying shares) of Lake City State Bank, Lake City, 
Minnesota ("Bank"). Jacob Schmidt Company, which owns 57.8 per 
cent of American Bancorporation, Inc.'s outstanding voting stock, 
would acquire indirect control of Bank. 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
and views has expired. The Board has considered the application 
and all comments received in the light of the factors set forth in 
§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)) and finds that: 
Applicant controls two banks with aggregate deposits of 
$197 million, representing 2.1 per cent of the total commercial bank 
deposits in the State, and is the fifth largest bank holding, 
company in Minnesota. (All banking data are as of June 30, 1971, 

and reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved 
through November 30, 1971.) Applicant's acquisition of Bank 
($11 million in deposits) would increase Applicant's share of 
deposits in the State by 0,1 percentage point. Bank, the only 
bank located in Lake City (estimated population: 3,600), is the 
third largest of five banks in the Red Wing banking market which 
is approximated by the northeast section of Wabasha County and the 
southwest section of Goodhue County, and holds 16.8 per cent of 
deposits in that market. Applicant's subsidiary located closest 
to Bank is about 55 miles distant; and it appears that consummation 
the transaction would not eliminate existing competition. On 
the facts of record, notably, the distances involved, the number of 
hanks in the intervening areas between Bank and Applicant's 
subsidiaries, and Minnesota's prohibitive branching law, there 
appears to be little likelihood that significant competition 
between Bank and Applicant would develop in the future. The Board 
concludes, therefore, that consummation of the proposed acquisition 
w°nld not adversely affect competition in any relevant area. 
Bank appears to be satisfactorily serving the financial 
U e e d S ° £ t h e community it serves; however, affiliation with 
Applicant would improve the quality, and expand the number of 
services Bank currently offers to the community. Affiliation with 
Applicant would increase the lending capability of Bank through 

participation arrangements with Applicant's present subsidiary 
banks, and would enable Bank to benefit from certain internal 
efficiencies resulting from a holding company structure. Addi-
tionally, Bank will be in a position to provide trust, travel 
and international services. Applicant also proposes to build a 
new facility for Bank, including in such plans drive-in facilities , 
off-street parking, and a "community room". Considerations 
relating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be 
served lend some weight toward approval. 
Considerations relating to financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects as they relate to Applicant, its 
subsidiaries and Bank, are regarded aa satisfactory. Applicant's 
proposed public offering will retire the debt incurred in the 
acquisition of Bank. Management expertise to be made available 
to Bank by Applicant lends weight toward approval of the 
application. Banking factors are believed consistent with ap-
proval. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the 
proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and that 
the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
for the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be 
consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the 

14

date of this Order or (b) later than three months after the date 
of this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by 
the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis pursuant 
to delegated authority.

Mr. Holland 
Subject; 
Revision of the Board 
a 
from Division of Personnel Administration 
Regular Salary Schedule 
In accordance with Section 3 of the Economic Stabilization 
Act Amendments (P.L. 92-210), the President signed Executive Order 
No. 11637 on December 22, 1971, granting certain Federal employees 
statutory pay increases effective in January 1972. 
The effective date for the Board, if approved, would be 
January 9, 1972. The law provides a general increase of approximate-
ly 5.5 per cent. 
Recommendation 
In keeping with the Board's policy of maintaining its em-
ployees' salary structure comparable to that of other agencies of the 
Federal Government, it is recommended that the Board approve the 
attached revision of its Regular Salary Schedule effective January 9, 
1972. This schedule is identical with the revised Government General 
Schedule. 
No salary rate adjustments are included in this recommendation 
for Board employees paid under the Metropolitan D. C. Prevailing Rate 
Wage Schedule or the Interdepartmental Lithographic Wage Board Pay 
Schedule. Such employees will receive pay increases by subsequent 
Congressional and/or Executive action. The Division of Personnel Admin-
istration will make separate recommendations to the Board as required. 
While no recommendations are contained in this memorandum 
regarding the salaries of the Board's Official Staff, the Division of 
Personnel Administration will bring forward by January 14, 1972, a 
salary program equal to 4-5% of aggregate official salaries. 
Implementation 
The following administrative procedures are recommended: 
« 
(1) The Division of Personnel Administration shall 
be responsible for making appropriate exceptions 

1 6 
To: Mr. Holland 
and adjustments where the change in the Regular 
Schedule affects other schedules or individual 
salaries, including: 
When Actually Employed Rates 
Retired Annuitants 
Contractual Workers 
Employees in "Saved-Pay" Status 
Employees in "Special Rate" Ranges 
The Office of the Controller will be responsible for 
implementation of payment of salaries at the new rates 
and will use Government regulations and interpretations 
as guides in deciding questions of administration and 
procedure.

For immediate release 
Item No. 4 
1/4/72 
January 19, 1972 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
announced further steps--in the form of expanded authority to the 
Federal Reserve Banks--to expedite the handling of applications 
received under the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Under the expanded authority, which is effective for appli-
cations received after January 21, the Federal Reserve Banks may 
approve: 
1. The acquisition by a bank holding company of additional 
snares in a subsidiary bank that are to be acquired through the exer-
cise of rights received by the bank's shareholders. 
2. Merger and Federal Reserve membership applications that 
a r e incident to one-bank holding company formations. The authority to 
approve the formation of one-bank holding companies was delegated to 
the Federal Reserve Banks last August. 
3. The acquisition by a registered bank holding company of 
a controlling interest in a new (de novo) bank if no objection to the 
Proposed acquisitior is made by the bank's supervisory authority, no 
new significant policy issue is raised by the proposal and the Reserve 
Bank determines that:

bank subsidiaries is satisfactory;

TITLE 12—BANKS AND BANKING 
CilAPTER II—FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
SUBCHAPTER A—BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PART 265—RULES REGARDING DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 
Bank Acquisitions by Holding Companies 
The Board of Governors has expanded the authority of 
the Federal Reserve Banks to approve applications by bank holding 
companies to acquire control of a bank. 
In August 1971 the Board delegated to the Reserve Banks 
substantial authority to approve the formation of one-bank holding 
companies and dispensed with the publication of an order and 
statement in cases approved by a Reserve Bank. 
The Board's evaluation of the manner in which such dele-
gated authority has been exercised and the Board's experience in 
considering applications by holding companies for bank acquisi-
tions have led the Board to expand the Reserve Banks' authority. 
Under the expanded authority the appropriate Reserve Bank may 
approve the acquisition by a registered bank holding company of a 
controlling interest in the shares of a newly-formed bank, within 
specified limitations. 
The Board has also delegated to the Reserve Banks 
authority to approve acquisition by a holding company of addi-
tional shares in a subsidiary bank to the extent the shares are 
acquired through the exercise, of rights received as n bank share-
holder. 

2 1 
- i -
The Board has clarified that the Reserve Banks' 
authority to approve the formation of a one-bank holding company

Enclosed is a copy of amendments to the Board's Rules Regard 
ing Delegation of Authority. The amendments are designed to make it 
clear that the Reserve Banks' authority to approve formation of one-
bank holding companies includes the authority to approve merger and 
membership applications incidental to such formations. Also, the 
Board has delegated to the Reserve Banks authority to approve 
section 3(a)(3) applications for the acquisition by a holding company 
of additional shares in a subsidiary bank when issued pursuant to a 
rights offering to the bank's shareholders. The amendments become 
effective as to applications received after January 21, 1972. 
The Board has also delegated to the Reserve Banks the 
authority to approve some acquisitions of a de novo bank by a 
registered bank holding company if the Reserve Bank determines that: 
(a) the general condition of the holding company and its 
bank subsidiaries is satisfactory; 
(b) the holding company has either (1) a proven record of 
furnishing to its subsidiary banks, when needed, special services, 
management, capital funds, or general guidance, or (2) in the case of 
a relatively new holding company, the Reserve Bank is satisfied that 
the company has the potential to provide such services; 
(c) (1) bank subsidiaries of the holding company do not 
hold in the aggregate more than 20 per cent of the commercial bank 
deposits in the relevant market area and (2) the holding company is 
not one of the dominant banking organizations in the State. From 
time to time the Board will provide the Reserve Banks with a list 
financial institutions it regards as dominant.

The Board still expects to publish in the Federal Register 
notice of receipt of each application under sections 3(a)(1) and 
3(a)(3) of the Act. Consequently, a copy of any application to be 
approved under delegated authority should continue to be mailed to 
the Board with an indication of the date upon which it was accepted. 
The Board's staff will forward to the Federal Register an appropriate 
notice with an indication that any comments on the application should 
be filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank by a specified date approxi-
mately 30 days after acceptance of the application by the Reserve Bank. 
A copy of the application should be sent to the chartering authority 
(either the State or the Comptroller of the Currency) and notification 
of acceptance of the application sent to the Department of Justice, 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and that chartering 
authority which did not receive a copy of the application. 
The statutes require that in merger applications a request 
for a report on the competitive factors be made of the Department 
°f Justice, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. Requests for these reports should be trans-
mitted by the Federal Reserve Bank to the Washington offices of the 
three agencies. 
Any action by a Reserve Bank approving an application 
under section 3(a)(3) is to be reflected in a letter to the appli-
cant that states the basis for such action. Each such letter should 
contain the same three conditions the Board now imposes in its orders 
appr ovmg acquisition of a de novo bank by a bank holding company, 
Tae weekly H.2 wire should contain the same information for section 
3(a)(3) applications as it now does for section 3(a)(1) applications 
Processed under delegated authority. 
The Board has also approved a procedure designed to promote 
efficiency by reducing the duplication of effort by Reserve Bank and 
Board staff. Under this new procedure, it is expected that in a 
majority of cases the Reserve Bank memorandum and summary attached 
thereto will be made available to the Members of the Board without 
a covering memorandum from Board staff. This procedure anticipates 
that, except for precedential or especially difficult cases, the 
role of the Board's staff will be principally to review or analyze 
Reserve Bank memoranda. Board staff will continue to make recom-
mendations in all cases and prepare memoranda when necessary. A 
letter to the officers in charge of Legal, Research, and Examination 
Departments outlining in detail this procedure will be forwarded 
soon by Mr. Leavitt. 

It is expected that this additional delegation, together 
with the revised procedures, will enable the System to process 
applications more expeditiously. This procedure will add to the 
responsibilities of the Reserve Banks and will require careful 
supervision to achieve an acceptable uniform standard of quality. 
Staff of the Board will work with staff of each of the Reserve 
Banks in an effort to achieve that acceptable quality and uniformity 
of approach to various questions. 
As with respect to all delegations of the Board's 
authority, a Reserve Bank may submit any application to the Board 
f°r its consideration. Consistent with the terms of this delega-
tion, this should be done when any of the guidelines is not met or 
where a Reserve Bank believes it appropriate. Should any applica-
tion raise a policy issue on which the Board has not had an oppor-
tunity to express its opinion, such application should be forwarded 
to the Board for consideration. In these cases, the Reserve Banks 
will follow the established practice of preparing memoranda and 
submitting recommendations.
