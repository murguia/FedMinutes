corporation organized under section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act 
to obtain a Treasury license to engage in the purchase, importing, 
and sale of gold bullion to authorized industrial, professional, and 
artistic users in the United States. 
Governor Robertson suggested that consideration of the matter 
be deferred pending further study of the question in the light of the 
communique issued on March 17, 1968, at the conclusion of the central 
bank conference held in Washington. 
There was agreement with Governor Robertson's suggestion. 
Appointment of consultant. The Board approved the recommenda-
tion in a memorandum from the Division of Examinations dated May 14, 
l968, that Robert I. Bouck of Falls Church, Virginia, be appointed as 
Consultant, effective June 1, 1968, until December 31, 1968, with 
compensation at the rate of $88 per day for each day worked and trans-
portation expenses and per diem in accordance with the Board's travel 
regulations.

_British situation. Governor Robertson and Mr. Holland reported 
eir understanding of the status of negotiations between the United 
kingdom and the U.S. Treasury relative to an international credit pack-
8 e 
might be arranged to assist in the refinancing of the U.K. 
eternal debt. It appeared that the negotiations had run into some 

1830 
5/21/68

temporary difficulty and that the British had now decided to delay 
somewhat a drawing on the International Monetary Fund. In the circum-
stances, it was possible that the British might want to draw further 
under their swap line with the Federal Reserve System to meet temporary 
requirements, and that matter was to be the subject of a memorandum to 
the Federal Open Market Committee from the Special Manager. The Special 
Manager, who was taking a position against further use of the swap line, 
had earlier suggested that a special meeting of the Open Market Commit-
tee be called this week. However, it had now been agreed that the 
subject would be taken up at the regular Committee meeting next Tuesday. 
I: 1;;, 
Governor Maisel requested information on the estimated extent 
British liabilities on forward commitments, and Mr. Reynolds sum-
marized such information as was presently available to the Board's 
OS: 
; 
staff. jje added that he had never understood why the Special Manager 
felt so strongly against temporary accommodation of the British under 
^ e swap line pending the prospective drawing from the International 
Monetary Fund. It appeared to him quite possible that the British had 
some good reason for not drawing from the Fund immediately, and the 
risks of resisting interim use of the swap line might be substantial. 
After further discussion of the circumstances as they might 
J 
V e l oP, it was understood that the subject would be considered at the 
°Pen Market Committee meeting next week. 
The meeting then adjourned.

De*r Mr. Ellis: 
As you know, a conference of protection officers of the Federal 
e$erve Banks was held at the Board's building March 15, 1968. At this 
conference Inspector R. I. Bouck of the Secret Service explained the 
curity principles used to develop the principal recommendations included 
n e Protecti on surveys of the Reserve Banks, and there was a free 
ange of ideas and information. There was, however, not enough time 
e*plore fully various aspects of training programs for guard personnel. 
It was the general view of those at the conference that, in 
to deal further with training programs, it would be desirable that 
and° n f e r e n C e ° f t h e m s e l v e s a n d their chief guards be held within 90 days, 
re 
t^ a t t*lere later be a session of the chief guards and the individuals
