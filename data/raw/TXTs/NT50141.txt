Reports on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller 
°f the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The Howard National Bank and Trust Company, Burlington, 
Vermont, and Montpelier Savings Bank and Trust Company, Montpelier, 
Vermont, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller. 
The conclusion read as follows: 
There is little or no competition between The Howard 
National Bank and Trust Company, Burlington, Vermont, and 
Montpelier Savings Bank and Trust Company, Montpelier, 
Vermont, to be eliminated by the proposed merger. Because 
Vermont permits Statewide branching, Howard National could 
attempt to branch de novo into Montpelier; thus, there is 
potential for more competition between them. On balance, 
it appears that the effect on competition would be slightly 
adverse. 
There had been distributed a draft report to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation on the competitive factors involved in the pro-
Posed purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of Sonsitaly Bank 
an
<* Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Continental Bank and 
Tri 
U s t
 Company, Norristown, Pennsylvania. The conclusion would state 
fc
hat the proposed transaction would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Discussion indicated a preference for the use of the term 
s l
ightly adverse" in the conclusion, whereupon the report was approved 
U r i a
nimously for transmittal to the Corporation in a form in which the 
inclusion read as follows: 
There is a small amount of competition between 
Sonsitaly Bank and Trust Company, Philadelphia, and Con-
tinental Bank and Trust Company, Norristown. The overall 
competitive effect of the proposal would be slightly 
a
dverse.

Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation of a report on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed merger of Bank of Davie, Mocksville, North 
Carolina, into Branch Banking & Trust Company, Wilson, North Carolina. 
The conclusion stated that the proposed merger would not have adverse 
competitive effects. 
Application of Society Corporation (Items 1 and 2). There had 
been distributed drafts of an order and statement reflecting the Board's 
a
Pproval, on August 3, 1967, of the application of Society Corporation, 
Cleveland, Ohio, to acquire 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of 
T h e
 Springfield Bank, Springfield, Ohio. 
The issuance of the order and statement was authorized. Copies 
the documents, in the form in which they were issued, are attached 
a s
 Items 1 and 2. 
Application of Detroit Bank and Trust Company. At the meeting 
°
n J u
l y 27, 1967, the Board discussed the application of The Detroit 
B a
nk and Trust Company, Detroit, Michigan, to consolidate with Commer-
c i a
l State Bank of Roseville, Roseville, Michigan. Since it appeared 
t t l a
t the views of the six members of the Board then present were 
e v
®nly divided, action was deferred.-'' On August 16, 1967, the Board 
r e
quested that the staff prepare drafts of alternative statements, one 
support of approval and the other in support of denial. Such drafts 
Governor Daane was not present.

had been distributed with a memorandum from the Legal Division dated 
September 12, 1967. 
Chairman Martin suggested that, even though Governor Robertson 
was unable to attend today's meeting, it might be well to dispose of 
the case if possible, in order to avoid further delay. In response to 
his inquiry, Governors Mitchell, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill indi-
cated that they continued to hold the views they had expressed during 
the initial discussion. Governor Daane stated that he had carefully 
s t
udied the material distributed regarding the case and had formed an 
°Pinion. 
A vote was then taken and the application was approved, Gov-
e r
nors Maisel and Brimmer dissenting. 
There ensued a discussion in which members expressed the view 
t
hat some revisions in,the draft statement in support of approval would 
^
e s
irable; in particular, Governor Daane said he had suggestions that 
would transmit to the Legal Division. Governor Brimmer suggested 
J.L 
the dissenting statement draw upon the reasoning the Banking Markets 
e c
tion had presented in support of its adverse recommendation, which he 
found persuasive. Governor Maisel indicated that he had also found 
p e r
suasive the analysis of the Research Department of the Federal Reserve

statement along the lines suggested by Governors Maisel and Brimmer 
also would be prepared. 
Messrs. Shay, Smith, Egertson, Greenspun, Shull, Via, Burton, 
Lyon, Maguire, McClintock, Sanford, and Rumbarger then withdrew, as did 
M r
s . Heller. 
Request by Chairman Patman (Item No. 3). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated September 13, 1967, from Mr. Langham regard-
i n
8 a request by Chairman Patman of the House Committee on Banking and 
C u
rrency for a listing as of December 31, 1966, of interbank domestic 
demand deposits and interbank time deposits held by individual reserve 
c i t
y member banks. The interbank demand deposits would include deposits 
o f
 both commercial banks and mutual savings banks; interbank time depos-
i t s
 would include those of both domestic banks and banks in foreign 
c
°untries. The data, it was noted, fell into the category of unpub-
lished information. 
A draft of transmittal letter to Chairman Patman, attached to 
t h e
 memorandum, would state that the listing "is furnished to you with 
t t l e
 understanding that information reported by individual banks will 
n
°t be revealed to anyone outside your staff nor will these data be 
p u b
li8hed in any form for a group of less than three banks." 
Mr. Langham commented on the composition and source of the data 
the reverse of the call report) and noted that, since a majority 
0 f
 ^ e banks involved were national banks, it would seem advisable to 

3579 
.Pi' ' v •

discuss the request with the Comptroller of the Currency before the 
information was sent. 
Governor Brimmer inquired whether, in Mr. Molony s judgment, 
Publication of the data could cause embarrassment. 
Mr. Molony replied that the Board's general position had been 
that it could not deny information of this general character requested 
by 
Congress, and the possibility that such information might be released 
always existed. The problem in the present case would not be with the 
general public, which would be little interested, but with the banks 
whose figures were released. 
Governor Brimmer then posed a series of questions, to which the 
t a
ff responded, regarding the recent transmittal to Chairman Patman of 
information regarding foreign branches of U.S. banks and of Edge and 
a
8
r
eement corporations, for certain parts of which confidentiality had 
b e e
n requested, and the subsequent notification to the institutions con-
C e
*ned that the Board itself might publish such information. 
Mr. Cardon expressed the view that in general it was inadvisable 
request confidential treatment in transmitting data to a Congressional 
c
°mmittee. it seemed better, if public disclosure might be damaging, to 
d e c
U n e to furnish information on that ground. However, as far as he 
k
new, there was no probability of damage in the present situation. There-
f o r e
> he suggested that the information be furnished without a condition 
°
f c
°nfidentia 1 ity. 

9/13/67 
-7-
Mr. Sherman expressed the view that no institution would be 
likely to suffer damage if its interbank deposit liabilities were made 
known in the aggregate, and Governor Daane agreed. 
Governor Brimmer noted that he had raised the question because 
he thought the last paragraph of the draft letter should be omitted. 
If the Comptroller of the Currency were informed of the proposed 
r e s
P°nse, and if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were also 
^formed as a matter of courtesy, he would be satisfied. 
After further discussion a letter to Chairman Patman was 
^£££oved unanimously in the form attached as Item No. 3, it being under-
stood that the procedures suggested by Governor Brimmer would be fol-
lowed. (A copy of the listing subsequently sent to Mr. Patman has been 
Placed in the Board's files.) 
Kansas City salary structures (Item No. 4). Unanimous approval 
W a s
 given to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City approv-
e s its request for increases in the employee salary structures at the 
h e a d
 office and branches (but with elimination of a one per cent increase 
a
kove the market on the effective date that the Bank had proposed for 
4.1

 head office structure); and also approving the Bank's request for a 
S p 6 c i a
l maximum of $22,000 for Grade 16 at the head office. A copy of 
the 
e
 letter is attached as Item No. 4. 
Messrs. Hart and Langham then withdrew from the meeting,

Proposed extension of Public Law 89-597. There had been dis-
tributed a draft statement regarding H.R. 12754, a bill that would 
extend for two years the authority provided by Public Law 89-597, 
approved September 21, 1966. The draft statement dealt with two aspects 
o f
 the bill in particular--the continuance of special authority to estab 
U s h maximum rates of interest that may be paid by banks and by other 
depositary-type institutions, and a provision under which the Board of 
Governors and the Reserve Banks would be audited annually by the General 
^counting Office. The statement was to be presented by Vice Chairman 
R
obertson before the House Committee on Banking and Currency on Sep-
tember 14, 1967. 
During discussion a number of revisions, primarily of an edi-
• 
t°rial nature, were suggested. 
Mr. Holland pointed out that the draft statement did not include 
comments on two provisions of Public Law 89-597, namely, those increas-
e s the statutory ceiling on reserve requirements for member bank time 
d e
Posit s and authorizing Federal Reserve open market operations in Fed-
6 r a l
 agency issues. However, he had drafted brief comments on those 
pr
°
v
isions that could be incorporated in the statement if desired. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it would be preferable 
a v
oid specific mention of every provision of the Public Law and noted 
to 
*ith 
°
f c
°ngre 
a
PProval that the statement also omitted reference to the "sense 
ress" clause. He felt that the inclusion of comments might lead 
0 d e
bate that it would be preferable to avoid.

At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
statement would be revised in the light of comments made at today's 
m e
eting and would be presented in a final form satisfactory to Vice 
Chairman Robertson. 
The meeting then recessed and reconvened in the Conference Room 
adjoining the Board Room at 10:55 a.m., with Chairman Martin and Gover-
nors Mitchell, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill p r e s e n t . M r . Shepardson, 
Consultant to the Board, also was present along with Messrs. Sherman, 
K e n
y o n , Brill, Holland, Johnson, Kelleher, Kakalec, O'Connell, Kern,

William H. Livingston, Jr., and Paul E. Doering of the architectural 
c . r i n
 of Harbeson Hough Livingston & Larson. 
Annex building. The Fine Arts Commission having indicated that 
it W a s

building that would include a penthouse floor to house mechanical equip-

After comments by the architects on the features and relative

was raised as to the views of the Board members regarding which of the 
a

except Governor Mitchell expressed themselves in favor of presenting 
the second alternative design. 
The meeting then adjourned.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY 
SOCIETY CORPORATION, CLEVELAND, OHIO, FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION 
OF VOTING SHARES OF THE SPRINGFIELD BANK, SPRINGFIELD, OHIO 
STATEMENT 
Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio ("Applicant"), a registered 
bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("the Act"), for prior 
e 
a
Pproval of the acquisition of 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of 
The Springfield Bank, Springfield, Ohio ("Bank"), a nonmember insured bank. 
1/ 
As of December 31, 1966, Applicant controlled three subsidiary banks which 
operated a total of 25 offices with aggregate total deposits of $637 million. 
Sank, a successor to a mutual savings institution, is located in Springfield, 
about 45 miles west of Columbus and 25 miles northeast of Dayton, and operates 
f
°ur offices with total deposits of $56 million. 
Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As required 
• 
- 
. . 
. 
• 
by 
section 3(b) of the Act, notice of receipt of the application was given 
to the 
Superintendent of Banks for the State of Ohio, and his views and 
r e
commendation were requested. The Superintendent, expressing the view that 
the proposed acquisition will be of substantial benefit to the community 
Springfield", recommended that the application be approved. 
! 
I T Unless otherwise noted, all banking data are of this date.

Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides that 
the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a monopoly 
or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize 
0 r
 to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the 
United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed acquisition the effect 
°f which, in any section of the country, may be substantially to lessen 
competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner 
w
°uld be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that the anti-
competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in 
the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting 
the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In each case the 
Board is required to take into consideration the financial and managerial 
res
°urces and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks 
concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - In Ohio, 13 banking 
°
r
ganizations, of which three are bank holding companies, control approxi-
mately 54 per cent of the aggregate deposits in the State. Applicant, with 
c
°ntrol of less than 4 per cent of such deposits, ranks fifth among the 13 
a n d
 controls 2 per cent of the banking offices in the State. Consummation 
the proposed acquisition would not change Applicant's relative position 
would have only a negligible effect on the share of the State's com-
tller
cial banking resources that are held by Applicant, by holding company 
^stems, or by the larger banking organizations in the State. 
There are five banks in Clark County, a prosperous agricultural 
a t e
a . Bank ranks first in the county in size of deposits with 31.6 per cent 

of the deposits of all banks. Slightly smaller and second in size (31.5 
per cent of deposits in the county) is First National Bank of Springfield,. , 
a subsidiary of BancOhio Corporation, a registered bank holding company. 
2/ 
Bank's primary service area is considered to encompass the City. 
Springfield and surrounding suburbs, an area estimated to include about 
91,000 people. Springfield is the principal city in Clark County. In 
Bank's primary service area, there are four banks with aggregate total 
deposits of approximately $163 million. Bank controls 34 per cent of these 
deposits and another 34 per cent is controlled by BancOhio Corporation. 
The impact of the proposed acquisition on the degree of concentra-
tion of 
banking resources in the State would be negligible. While con-
summation of the proposal would result in a sizable increase in the percentage 
deposits under bank holding company control in the county and in the 
Springfield area, it is apparent that the affiliation would not cause the 
V : 
tk 
.. 
' 
dumber of banking alternatives in the service area to be reduced nor cause 
the concentration of deposits already existing in these banking organizations 
to be 
increased; On the record before the Board it is concluded that the 
Proposed affiliation would not result in a monopoly nor be in furtherance 
any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the 
^siness of banking in any relevant area. 
Considering next the probable effect of consummation of Applicant's 
P
r
°posal on existing and potential competition, the Board finds that these 
The^area from which Applicant estimates that Bank derives about 
Per cent of the deposits of individuals, partnerships, and corpora-
t i o n s ( " I P C deposits"). 

- 4 -
r i 
* 
considerations present no bar to approval of the application. Bank and 
i 
Applicant's closest (geographically) subsidiary are separated by 122 miles 
•*• 
i 
and several intervening banks. Applicant reports that the number of 
deposit and loan accounts held by Bank that originate in the primary service 
areas of Applicant's subsidiaries is insignificant; and that no loans or 
deposits of Applicant's subsidiaries originate in Bank's primary service 
area. On the basis of the data before the Board, it is concluded that there 
is no meaningful present competition between Bank and Applicant's sub-
sidiaries; and it appears unlikely that any significant future competition 
between them would be foreclosed by the proposed affiliation. 
Bank's main competitor is First National Bank of Springfield. 
As earlier stated, it is a subsidiary of BancOhio Corporation and controls 
31.5 
per cent of the deposits in the county. Two other Springfield banks 
also provide competition. While Bank ranks first in the county in terms of 
total deposits, it is noted that,with respect to IPC demand deposits, it 
ranks third among the four banks competing in its service area--a fact 
apparently explained by Bank's history as a mutual savings institution. 
Bank has not been aggressive with respect to commercial loans and its 
Portfolio has limited diversification. In these circumstances, Applicant's 
e x
perience in converting a predominantly savings-oriented institution into 
a
 full-service ooojrerciKl bank promises significant assistance to Bank in 
competing for demand deposits and commercial loans. An examination of the 
facts presented with respect to Bank's competitors indicates that more 
a
8gressive competition from Bank, particularly for the latter type of 
business, is not likely to impair the competitive vigor of existing 
in
-»titutions operating in the area.

The Board concludes that consummation of the proposed transaction 
would not substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly nor 
in any other manner restrain trade in any relevant section of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. - The 
financial condition and management of Applicant and its subsidiaries are 
reasonably satisfactory, and their prospects are considered to be favorable. 
Banks' financial condition and management are generally satis-
factory. While its prospects as a subsidiary of Applicant appear to be 
favorable, its prospects other than as Applicant's affiliate are not 
similarly favorable. The record shows that, if this application is denied, 
character and experience of Bank's ownership and management are un-
C e
rtain factors. Substantially all the shares of Bank are now owned by 
Springfield Center Corporation which, in turn, is owned by the directors 
°f Bank who formed the corporation to acquire Bank's stock in an effort 
t o
 prevent Bank from being sold 
to interests that might not be 
acceptable to Bank's management. The purchase was financed by, a loan from 
°
ne
 of Applicant's subsidiaries, and Applicant received an option to pur-
chase at least 90 per cent of the shares at the price paid by Springfield 
Center Corporation (plus interest and expenses). Applicant reports that, 
the application herein is denied, sale of Bank's control will be required 
i n
 order to liquidate the aforementioned loan, thus giving rise to the 
e a
rlier-mentioned uncertainty as to future ownership and management. The 
**°ard concludes that considerations relating to the banking factors as 
t e
£lected in the record herein are consistent with and afford some weight 
favor of approval of the proposed transaction.

Convenience and needs of the commuhifcy involved. - While the 
banking needs of the areas involved appear to be adequately served by the 
several banks competing therein, the affiliation herein offers added con-
venience to the community involved by offering services not currently 
Mailable through Bank. As indicated earlier, Applicant can assist Bank 
in competing more aggressively and effectively for commercial loans and 
demand deposits, thus becoming a full-service commercial bank, a result 
beneficial to the business firms in the area. In addition, Applicant pro-
Poses that Bank will offer to the community certain new services, including 
Post office box service, consultation on business financial affairs, check 
re
concilement service, investment advisory assistance, and bond and market

The Board concludes that the evidence relating to the convenience

favor of approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all the relevant facts 
°°ntained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in sec-
°n 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction

Mr. George H. Clay, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 
Kansas City, Missouri. 64198 
Dear Mr. Clay: 
After careful consideration of recent proposals for employee 
salary structure revisions at the Reserve Banks, the Board of Governors 
has approved a procedure under which revised salary ranges would be 
based upon midpoints at estimated market levels at the date the struc-
ture is to become effective, but without any additional allowance for 
increases in market beyond that date. The estimated market levels 
would, of course, be projected from the date of the most recent survey. 
Therefore, the request for salary structure revision at the 
Head Office contained in your letter of August 11, 1967, is approved 
subject to the elimination of the allowance (one per cent) for increases 
in the level of market salaries beyond the proposed effective date, 
September 1. 
As requested in your letter, the Board of Governors approves 
the following minimum and maximum salaries for the respective grades of 
the employees' salary structures at the Branches, effective September 1,

Mr. Carl J. Thomsen, 
Chairman of the Board 
and Federal Reserve Agent, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 
Dallas, Texas. 
75222 
Dear Mr. Thomsen: 
Acting under delegated authority, the Director of the Division 
°f Personnel Administration has approved the request contained in your 
letter of September 6, 1967, for the appointment of Mr. James R. Benton 
a
s Assistant Federal Reserve Agent. 
This approval is given with the understanding that Mr. Benton 
will be solely responsible to the Federal Reserve Agent and the Board of 
Governors for the proper performance of his duties, except that, during 
the absence or disability of the Federal Reserve Agent or a vacancy in 
that office, his responsibility will be to the Board of Governors. 
When not engaged in the performance of his duties as Assistant 
Federal Reserve Agent, Mr. Benton may, with the approval of the Federal 
Reserve Agent and the President of the Bank, perform such work for the 
Bank as will not be inconsistent with his duties as Assistant Federal 
Reserve Agent. 
It will be appreciated if Mr. Benton is fully informed of the 
importance of his responsibilities as a member of the staff of the 
Federal Reserve Agent and the need for maintenance of independence from 
the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these responsibilities. 
It is noted that upon receipt of the approval of the appoint-
ment by the Board of Governors, Mr. Benton will execute the usual Oath 
Office which will be forwarded to the Board. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.

Mr. R. R. Wiaecarver, President 
Greene County Bank 
Greenevllle, Tennessee 
37743 
Dear Mr. Wiaecarver: 
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 
September 7, 1967, requesting approval of the investment by the 
Greene County Bank of an amount for finishing up the upper three 
stories of the bank's new building, which would result In the 
total Investment in premises amounting to more than the capital 
stock of the bank. 
It is understood that the cost of the work 
originally contemplated would have been within the limits pre-
scribed by Section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act, but recently 
the building committee has authorised the contractor to finish 
the three upper stories at a coat of $60,604, which will result 
in the total investment, when completed, exceeding the bank's 
capital atock by some $50,000 to $55,000. 
As Mr. Sheffer explained to you in his telephone 
conversation this morning, it is obviously impossible to grant 
the prior approval of this additional cost as contemplated by 
the statute since the contractor has already been Instructed to 
proceed with the work and this will necessarily have to be re-
ported as a violation of Section 24A. This is to advise, 
hovever, that we will not object to the completion of this work 
on the building. Caution should be exercised to refrain from 
authorising any additional expenditures in this connection 
without obtaining prior approval as required by the statute. 
Very truly yours, 
R. M. Stephenson 
Vice President

Federal Reserve System
