Regulation concerning certain transactions involving purchase of bonds 
b
y banks. 
In a letter dated May 13, 1968, the Executive Vice President 
°f the Florida Bankers Association had forwarded information to the 
Comptroller of the Currency indicating that some banks, with the coop-
eration of brokers, had been engaging in bond transactions the circum-
stances of which were not properly disclosed on the banks' books. 
The 
Comptroller of the Currency had addressed a letter to all national banks 
calling attention to the impropriety of such transactions, and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reportedly planned to send a 
similar letter to nomnember insured banks. 
Following explanatory remarks by Mr. Leavitt, the Board unani-
mously approved the transmission of a letter to the Federal Reserve 
Banks (copy attached as Item No. 2) enclosing a draft of letter that 
was suggested be sent to each State member bank on the subject of 
S u c
h bond transactions. 
Implementation of Regulation D amendments (Item No. 3). 
There 
had been distributed a memorandum dated July 24, 1968, from the Data 
cessing, Federal Reserve Bank Operations, and Legal Divisions 
e t

c
°nnection with implementing the amendments to Regulation D, Reserves 
^ Member Banks, with respect to "lagged reserves" that had been adopted 
t o b e

e r t
a i n possible alternatives thereto, had been developed following a 
S y s

°ear Sir: 
The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation have called to the attention 
national and State insured nonmember banks bond trans-
itions in which some banks have recently engaged. Such 
transactions are not considered appropriate since they 
result in deferring losses and placing new bonds on the 
books above market value. It is suggested that a letter 
along the line of the enclosed draft be sent to the 
chief executive officer of each State member bank in 
your District.

PROPOSED DRAFT 
D
*ar sirj 
Recently we have learned that some banks, with the cooperation 
brokers, are engaging in bond transactions the circumstances of which 
n
°t properly disclosed on the bank's books* Under this procedure, 
a
 bank 
luarUp »-value below cost sells such bonds at a price above the market, 
owning bonds carried on its books at cost but having a current 
USuaI i 
A
V at a price equivalent to book value of the bonds. The bank then 
c
hases from the same broker other bonds (often of longer maturity 
ifit-u 
tn a higher yield) at a price sufficiently above market value to 
U r
se the broker for (1) loss sustained on the bonds sold to him 
ky th 
e
 bank and (2) a broker's fee. The bonds are then recorded at the 
Hev; ii 
C
°
8t
" (above market value). Such transaction has the effect of 
(i) d e f 
e r r
ing the recognition of loss on bonds sold by the bank and 
pi 
new bonds on the bank's books at a price above their true 
^tket v
alue when purchased.

Resume 
fflw, 
Bank A - sells a 3% yield and purchases a 3.50% yield. 
Covers up a market loss; fails to book and take 
advantage of a portfolio tax loss. 
Sales Advantage - Improves current yield 50 basis points. 
Dealer - Loss on purchase - $10,000 
Dealer - Profit on sale 
- $11,590 
Dealer's Net Profit 
- $ 1,590 
Deferring losses incurred on the sale of bonds by recording 
°
ndG
 Purchased at inflated prices is an unsound banking practice. When 
e
Hing bonds the bank should record any gain or loss realized based on 
a
ctual market price prevailing at that time. Moreover, bonds pur-
- i 
should be recorded on a bank's books at actual market value.

 the meeting of System representatives on the implementation

Deficiencies in reserve balances in period ending September 11.

a 8

the penalty. If a member bank has a deficiency of 3 per cent 
in one period, and excess reserves of 1 per cent in the following 
period, the 2 per cent remaining is to be considered as a single 
deficiency. 
3. Reporting of penalties waived. 
The Board's letter of June 8, 1967, (F.R.L.S. #9025.01) 
requests that all waivers of penalties for deficient reserves 
during a calendar quarter be reported within a few days after 
the close of the period. Effective with the quarterly period 
ending September 1968, it will be sufficient for each Reserve 
Bank to report the waivers in summary form by number and amount 
according to any specific guidelines or rules followed. A 
statement of such guidelines or rules should be attached to 
the report and complete information reported for waivers that 
d
o not fall within such guidelines. 
Application of the amended regulation to newly organized 
member banks, nonmember banks converting to membership 
status, and newly merged banks. 
In the case of a newly organized bank, current deposits 
during the first two weekly periods should be used to compute 
required reserves. These same requirements would also apply 
t 0
 the third and fourth weekly periods. For a newly admitted 
member bank, deposits during the two weeks prior to admission 
should be used in making such computations. Similarly, in 
m e
*ger situations, deposits of the merging banks for the pre-
vious two weeks should be combined on a pro forma basis in 
order to compute required reserves for the merged institution. 
The reserve rate applicable to the continuing bank should be 
used. 
Although these principles could eventually be incorporated 
l n
 an amendment or interpretation of the regulation, it would 
8 e
em that they can be implemented adequately and perhaps more 
appropriately, at the administrative level.

establishing requirements and the vault cash credit for the 
first two weekly periods under the amended regulation. Reserve 
city banks thus will be subject to the same requirements and 
have the same vault cash credit for the weeks ended September 18 
and September 25 as had been applied for the weeks ended 
September 4 and September 11. Requirements and vault cash 
applicable 
to the two-week country bank period ended with the 
opening of business for September 11 will be split into two 
separate weeks. No close-of-business figures will be used 
for this computation until the period ending September 18 to 
establish requirements for the week ended October 2.
