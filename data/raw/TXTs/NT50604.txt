Report on competitive factors. 
A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed consolidation of The First National 
Bank of Cedar Lake, Cedar Lake, Indiana, and State Bank of Whiting, 
Whiting, Indiana, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Comptroller of the Currency. 
The conclusion read as follows: 
There is little existing competition between The First National 
Bank of Cedar Lake and State Bank of Whiting, and limited potential for 
increased competition between them. 
Considering the two banks directly 
involved in this proposal, any increase in concentration in the Lake 
County area would not be significant; however, Bank of Indiana, National 
Association, will be closely associated with the resulting bank, and 
these latter two banks would hold about 16 per cent of the deposits in 
Lake County. 
Consummation of the proposed consolidation would permit 
Bank of Whiting to broaden its competitive base which is somewhat limited 
in Whiting, and thereby increase the potential for intensified competition 
in the Cedar Lake-St. John area through the entry of a larger bank. 
On balance, the overall effect of the proposed consolidation on 
competition would be slightly adverse. 
First Connecticut Bancorp. 
The issuance of an order and state-
ment reflecting approval on March 31, 1970, of the application of First 

if3 
4/17/70 
-3-
Connecticut Bancorp, Inc., Hartford, Connecticut, to become a bank 
holding company through the acquisition of shares of three banks was 
authorized. 
Copies of the order and statement, as issued, are attached under 
Item No. 1, along with copies of the dissenting statements of Governors 
Robertson and Maisel. 
Commerce Bancshares. 
Against the background of documentation 
that had been distributed, consideration was given to applications by 
Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, to acquire shares of 
American Trust Company of Hannibal, Hannibal, Missouri; Tipton Farmers 
Bank, Tipton, Missouri; and Mexico Savings Bank, Mexico, Missouri. 
The 
Reserve Bank and staff recommendations were favorable. 
There was discussion of the rapidity of holding company expan-
sion in Missouri, particularly on the part of applicant, and a degree 
of concern was expressed by some Board members. 
Mr. Shull reported 
that a study of the Missouri banking structure by the Banking Markets 
Section was in process and should be available in the near future. 
The applications before the Board were then approved unanimously, 
with the understanding that appropriate implementing documents would be 
prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that 
he would issue a separate statement reflecting the concern that he felt 
with respect to the rapidity of bank holding company expansion in the 
State. 
Governor Robertson voted in favor of the Mexico application 

M i l n o

reluctantly, indicating that he saw adverse competitive effects and 
would have voted in the negative had it not been for comments placed 
on record by the State Banking Commissioner. 
First National Bancorporation. 
In a memorandum dated April 9, 
1970, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended denial of 
the application of The First National Bancorporation, Inc., Denver, 
Colorado, to acquire shares of The First National Bank of Greeley, 
Greeley, Colorado, on the grounds that the acquisition would accelerate 
the trend toward concentration of Colorado banking in the hands of the 
few Statewide holding companies and foreclose significant future compe-
tition in Greeley. 
The Banking Markets Section recommended approval of 
the application on the grounds that the competitive effect would be only 
slightly adverse and would be outweighed by convenience and needs con-
siderations, particularly since applicant intended to supply additional 
loanable funds to the Greeley area. 
It was the Legal Division's view 
that approval of the application might be overturned in court on the 
basis of a Clayton Act standard meant to prevent a series of acquisitions, 
no one of which violated antitrust law, that together led to excessive 
concentration. 
The legal staff recommended that the application be 
denied or, if approval were given, that the Board's statement include 
recognition of the trend of holding company acquisitions in Colorado 
and the distinctions seen between this case and others.

Staff members of the respective divisions presented their 
analyses of the factors involved in this case, following which they 
responded to a number of questions raised by Board members. 
In this 
connection, reference was made to other Colorado holding company appli-
cations now in the pipeline, and a suggestion was made that the Board 
might want to defer consideration of this application in order that it 
might be taken up at the same time as the others. 
However, the con-
sensus was that it would be better to proceed to a decision on the 
application now before the Board, although it was agreed that it would 
be appropriate to have in mind as one factor the knowledge that the other 
cases were on the horizon. 
Board members then expressed their views on the Greeley appli-
cation and it developed that there was a majority opinion in favor of 
approval. 
Accordingly, the application was approved, Governors Robertson, 
Maisel, and Brimmer dissenting,! with the understanding that an order 
and statement reflecting the decision would be prepared for the Board's 
consideration and that a dissenting statement also would be prepared. 
Governor Maisel stated that he did not wish to participate in 
the discussion of the next succeeding item on the agenda in view of an 
acquaintanceship of long standing with one of the directors of the bank 
involved. 
He therefore withdrew from the room. A number of staff 
members who had been present also withdrew and the meeting continued 
with limited staff attendance.

Bank of Minneapolis and Trust Company. 
In a letter dated 
April 6, 1970, discussed at the Board meeting (with President Galusha 
present) on April 15, 1970, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 
requested that the Board issue and serve upon Bank of Minneapolis and 
Trust Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota, a notice of charges of unsafe 
and unsound practices, and fix a time and place for a hearing to deter-
mine if a cease and desist order should issue against the bank under 
the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966. 
The Reserve Bank 
also requested that the Board issue a temporary order requiring that 
the member bank immediately cease and desist from such practices. 
The specific practice that the Reserve Bank believed was likely

to cause substantial dissipation of the member bank's assets was the

accounts of personal and corporate interests of the bank's Chairman 
and principal stockholder, Thomas K. Scallen, against uncollected funds 
or which would create or increase an overdrawn condition in the demand 
deposit accounts of Mr. Scallen and his corporate interests. 
The Board now had before it drafts of a notice of charges that 
might be issued and a temporary cease and desist order. 
Mr. O'Connell outlined three alternative actions that the Board 
might take in this case, as follows: 
(1) 
The Board could issue a notice of charges and 
require the member bank's directors to appear at a hearing 
to answer the charges. A temporary cease and desist order, 

1211 
4/17/70 
-7-
which would be issued along with the notice of charges, 
would require that every effort be made to effect reason-
able and prompt payment of the Scallen overdrafts and 
that future loans be adequately collateralized. 
(2) 
The Board could issue the notice of charges 
without the cease and desist order and proceed to a 
hearing on the merits. 
(3) 
The Board could give the bank's directors the 
option of signing a statement to the effect that the 
overdraft practices in question would be stopped immediately. 
After discussion of the foregoing possibilities, Mr. O'Connell 
: 
' 
, ( t 
,. 
H i , ' 
outlined another alternative course of action, which was subsequently 
modified somewhat by Governor Robertson. 
This alternative contemplated 
the preparation of a notice of charges relating specifically to the 
overdraft practices. 
The directors of the member bank would be advised 
that such a notice of charges was being prepared and that a directors' 
meeting should be called next Monday, or as early thereafter as possible 
at which time representatives of the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank 
would meet with the directors and offer to them the opportunity to sign 
a consent cease and desist order based on the notice of charges. 
If 
the order was signed by the directors, any violation of its terms would 
enable the Board, under the statute, to go to court immediately and 
obtain enforcement. 
This course of action was approved unanimously, and it was 
understood that steps would be taken to implement it. 
In this connec-
tion, the Board noted the possibility of lack of a quorum in the first 

4/17/70 
-8-
part of next week and therefore authorized available members to act on 
behalf of the Board in the taking of such actions as might be indicated 
in the light of the meeting with the member bank's directors. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, and 
Johnson then withdrew from the meeting and Governor Maisel returned to 
the room. 
Salary schedule adjustment. 
The Board approved unanimously an 
adjustment of the regular salary schedule for Board employees retro-
active to December 28, 1969, along with related recommendations contained 
in a memorandum from the Division of Personnel Administration dated 
April 14, 1970, a copy of which is attached as Item No. 2. 
Governor Robertson called attention to the recommendation in 
the memorandum that employees' contribution rates to the Thrift Plan 
be applied to the retroactive pay and that the Board match those con-
tributions in the same manner that it matched contributions out of 
current pay. While he had voted originally against the making of 
matching contributions by the Board and continued to feel that the 
decision to make matching contributions was in error, the plan was in 
effect and in the circumstances the recommendation seemed appropriate. 
Governor Maisel noted that he also had voted against the making of 
matching contributions by the Board. 
The Chairman indicated that he had had some misgivings when he 
learned about this feature of the plan. 
He inquired whether the same 

4/17/70 
-9-
effect could not have been achieved through salary adjustments, and 
other members of the Board outlined problems that would have been 
involved in the adoption of such an alternative. 
Governor Sherrill advised that he would present to the Board for 
consideration a proposal for adjustment of officer salaries that would 
be compatible with the action just taken with respect to the regular 
salary schedule for employees. 
Reserve Bank officer. 
The Board approved unanimously the pay-
ment of salary to Jimmie R. Monhollon as Senior Vice President in charge 
of the Charlotte Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond at the 
annual rate of $27,500 for the period July 1 through December 31, 1970. 
Mr. Monhollon would succeed Edmund F. Mac Donald, who had elected early 
retirement. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Richmond Bank is attached as 
Item N o . 3. 
Staff appointment. 
The Board approved unanimously the appoint-
ment of Lawrence F. Noble, currently Senior Attorney in the Legal 
Division, as Assistant General Counsel effective April 19, 1970, with 
annual salary at the rate of $23,500. 
Credit Union facilities. 
As recommended in memoranda from the 
Division of Administrative Services and the Controller dated March 20 
and April 1, 1970, respectively, the Board approved unanimously the 
installation of a steel-clad wall containing two bulletproof tellers'

windows and a door, together with an alarm system, in the Credit Union 
office at an estimated- cost of $4,000, of which approximately $3,000 
would be charged against funds budgeted for the new annex building. 
The Board also approved any resulting overexpenditure in the pertinent 
budget accounts. 
The meeting then adjourned.

APPLICATION BY 
FIRST CONNECTICUT BANCORP, INC., HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 
FOR APPROVAL OF ACTION TO BECOME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
STATEMENT 
First Connecticut Bancorp, Inc., Hartford, Connecticut, 
("Applicant"), has applied to the Board, pursuant to section 3(a)(1) of 
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, for prior approval of action to become 
a
 bank holding company, through the acquisition of all of the voting 
shares of United Bank and Trust Company, Hartford ("United Bank") and 
Simsbury Bank and Trust Company, Simsbury, ("Simsbury Bank"), and 80 
Per cent or more of the voting shares of The New Britain National Bank, 
Britain ("New Britain Bank"),, all located in the State of Connecticut. 
Vi 
ews and recommednations of supervisory authorities. - As 
S q u i r e d by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board notified the Comptroller 
o f
 the Currency and the Commissioner of Banks of the State of Connecticut 
o f
 receipt of the application and requested their views and recommendations 
t h
ereon. 
Both the Comptroller and the Commissioner recommended that the 
a
Ppiication be approved. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
m
°nopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
^enopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 

part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed acqui-
sition the effect of which, in any section of the country, may be sub-
stantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, 
or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the 
Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction 
are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of 
the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served. 
In each case the Board is required to take into consider-
ation the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the 
bank holding company and the banks concerned, and the convenience and 
needs of the communities to be served. 
Competitive effect of the proposed transaction - Banking in 
the State of Connecticut is relatively highly concentrated, with the 
two largest banks in the State holding 37 per cent of the deposits held 
by the 64 commercial banks in Connecticut.
-
' Each of the two largest 
banks is about twice as large as the third largest bank in the State. 
United Bank, the tenth largest, is about one-tenth the size of the 
largest bank, and less than one-ninth as large as the second largest. 
The 10 largest banks in the State hold 81 per cent of the State's 
commercial bank deposits. 
United Bank ($90 million deposits), the largest of the proposed 
subsidiaries, is headquartered in Hartford, and has 16 offices in 10 
cities and towns in the central and southeastern portions of the State. 
1/ All banking data are as of June 30, 1969, adjusted to reflect 
^ r g e r s approved by supervisory authorities to date. 

-3-
Simsbury Bahk ($25 million deposits) has four offices: 
its main office 
in Simsbury, and a branch in each of the adjacent towns of Avon, Granby, 
and Canton. New Britain Bank ($52 million deposits) has six offices: 
three in New Britain, two in Berlin, and one in West Hartford. 
All but two of the offices of United Bank are located within, 
or at the fringes of, a market approximated by a geographic area within 
a radius of 15 miles of the center of the city of Hartford. This area, 
he 
reinafter referred to as "the Hartford area," also encompasses all of 
the offices of Simsbury Bank and New Britain Bank. The head offices of 
the three subject banks are 10-12 miles apart. 
The nearest office of 
United Bank is about six miles from any office of Simsbury Bank, and 
four miles from an office of New Britain Bank; no office of Simsbury 
Bank is within 12 miles of an office of New Britain Bank. 
To an even greater extent than is true of the State as a 
whole, banking in the Hartford area is dominated by the State's two 
largest banks, both of which are headquartered in the area. 
These 
two banks, Connecticut Bank and Trust Company ($830 million deposits) 
and Hartford National Bank and Trust Company ($901 million deposits) 
have a combined total of 43 off 
ices in the Hartford area, which account 
for over 80 per cent of the area deposits held by 18 banks competing 
ther 
ein. As a result of its downtown Hartford location, coupled x>/ith 
area commuting patterns, United Bank, the third largest bank in the area 
in overall size, competes to some extent throughout the area. 
Its com-
petitive force, however, is not nearly the equal of the ti^o larger banks, 
^hich have offices blanketing the area. New Britain Bank and Simsbury 

l.Art."* 
4 
Bank, the fourth and sixth largest in the area, serve a limited portion 
of the area, as do the area's 13 other banks. The three subject banks, 
as a group, would control about 8 per cent of the deposits originating in 
the Hartford area. 
Consummation of Applicant's proposal would eliminate some 
competition between United Bank and each of the other two proposed 
subsidiaries, and would reduce the number of competing banking organizations 
in the Hartford area from 18 to 16. On the other hand, Applicant would 
present a much stronger competitive alternative to the two larger banks 
in the Hartford area. 
In determining the relative weight to be assigned to those 
competitive effects which are adverse to Applicant's proposal and those 
which are favorable to it, it is significant that banking concentration 
in the Hartford area results not from a lack of a sufficient number of 
competitors, but from the fact that the two dominant banks in the area 
far outstrip the other 16 both in overall size and in market share. 
In view of this, it is concluded that competition will not be significantly 
lessened by the reduction in competitive alternatives which would result 
from consummation of the proposal. 
Rather, it appears that competition 
Would be promoted as a result of the more balanced market structure 
v,
hich \tfould be brought about by the creation of a third strong organization 
in the area. 
In addition, with a strong base in the Hartford area, 
Applicant would constitute a significant potential competitor in other 
concentrated markets in the State.

The Board concludes that consummation of the proposed trans-
»v. ... 
action would not result in a monopoly or be in furtherance of any 
combination, conspiracy or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
in any area, and would not substantially lessen competition, tend to 
create a monopoly, or restrain trade in any section of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant would begin operations with a satisfactory financial con-
dition. 
Its management would be comprised of competent and ex-
perienced senior management of the three subsidiary banks and its 
prospects, which would be dependent upon those of the proposed 
subsidiaries, appear favorable. 
The financial condition and management of the proposed sub-
sidiaries are satisfactory, and the prospects of all three are 
favorable. 
These considerations are consistent with approval of the 
application. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. -
Hartford is located in central Connecticut, about 115 miles northeast 
Of New York City and 102 miles southwest of Boston. 
It is one of the 
world's leading insurance centers, and the State's primary financial 
center. Manufacturing in the Hartford area is highly diversified-, but 
there is heavy emphasis on the fabricated metals, aircraft, and machinery 
industries. 

1ZZ9 
-6-
As earlier indicated, the Hartford area is served by a large 
number of banks, including the two largest in the State. 
The area is 
also served by a large number of mutual savings banks, with aggregate 
deposits which are only slightly less than those held by the commercial 
bank offices located in the same area. The banking needs of the Hartford 
area are adequately served at present, and the principal effect of 
Applicant's proposal would be to improve the services offered by the three 
Proposed subsidiaries, making them more competitive with services offered 
b
V the larger banks. Applicant proposes to expand and improve business 
lending, trust, and municipal .financing services of the subject banks. 
While the lending ability of Applicant's organization would continue to 
b
e far less than that of its largest c o m p e t i t i o n , the increased 
facility for arranging participations would enable the subsidiary banks 
to compete meaningfully in meeting a larger portion of the area's credit 
n
eeds than any of them can serve alone. 
These considerations support approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant 
f
acts contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set 
forth in section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that 
t h
e proposed acquisition would be in the public interest, and that 
application should be approved. 
V i l

1230 
Dissenting Statement of Governor Robertson 
Mr. Justice Holmes once said: 
"Men must turn square corners 
when they deal with the government". 
(Rock Island, A . & L . R.R. Co. v . 
United States, 254 U.S. 141, 143 (1920)). Likewise, in my view, the 
public is entitled to expect that government agencies will "turn square 
corners" in carrying out a Congressional mandate. 
In the Bank Holding Company Act, Congress forbade the 
approval of any acquisition the effect of which "may be substantially 
to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly" (the language 
of section 7 of the Clayton Act), unless the anticompetitive effects 
Hare clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of 
the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to 
be served." 
Here, the three subject banks are all located in the Hartford 
market. Although each of them is substantially smaller than either of 
the two largest banks in the area, they are among the very largest 
of the remaining area banks, ranking third, fourth and sixth in size 
among 18 banks in the Hartford area. Each is a capable competitor, 
with demonstrated ability to establish branches outside the town or 
city in which it is headquartered. 
United Bank is headquartered in Hartford, 
the principal city in the area. 
It serves persons commuting to the city 
from all parts of the area, and, additionally, has several offices in 
other parts of the area. New Britain Bank and Simsbury Bank serve 
economically significant segments of the area, and United Bank is a 

1Z 
-2-
significant competitor for business arising in both of the areas served 
by the two smaller banks. 
(A large portion of the Simsbury population 
commutes to Hartford). 
In Simsbury, where Simsbury Bank maintains the only banking 
office serving a population of over 16,000, the anticompetitive effects 
of the proposal will be especially serious. Under Connecticut law, 
a bank is permitted to establish branches at any location in the State, 
except that it may not establish a branch in any town in which another 
bank is headquartered. The law appears to make no exception to the 
latter prohibition in a case where the bank which is headquartered in 
the town is a subsidiary of a bank holding company. Thus, it appears 
that, for the indefinite future, there will continue to be only one 
bank in Simsbury, in the absence of a new bank being chartered in the 
town. The fact that such local monopoly will be maintained under the 
present proposal makes it especially undesirable that United Bank 
(one of the larger banks in Hartford) will no longer present meaningful 
alternative banking facilities competitive with those provided by the 
Simsbury Bank, 
The lessening of competition which will result from con-
summation of Applicant's proposal will be substantial by any reasonable 
Measure, That being the case, the statutory criteria require that the 
application be denied, unless such anticompetitive effects are clearly 
outweighed by the statutory "convenience and needs" factor. 
The 

>f O ' J O 
-3-
convenience and needs of the community to be served, in the present 
case, are well met indeed. There admittedly are no such needs going 
unserved. 
The Board's majority avoids the necessity of finding a clear 
outweighing of the anticompetitive effects of the proposal by concluding 
that competition will not be substantially lessened. That conclusion is 
reached by attributing offsetting weight in the competitive balance 
to the greater ability of the subject banks, under Applicant's proposal, 
to compete with the two larger banks in their market. The Act, however, 
Provides no authority for a restructuring of the nation's banking system 
in the image of the markets' largest banking organizations. 
On the 
contrary, the intent of Congress was to preserve a framework for a system 
in which sound banks, both large and small, would compete in serving the 
markets in which they are located. 
Combinations of moderate-sized banks under the holding 
company format might be permissible if such banks were located in separate 
Markets, but when three viable banks compete to a significant degree in 
the same market, (as in this case), their combination inevitably lessens 
competition in that market substantially, and in such a case the statute 
clearly defines the limited circumstances under which approval of their 
^filiation can be granted. Those circumstances simply are not present 
In this case.

With respect to the limits on its own authority, the Supreme 
Court has said: 
"Though our preference were for monopoly and 
against competition, we should 'guard against 
the danger of sliding unconsciously from the narrow 
confines of law into the more spacious domain 
of policy.

A regulatory agency, no less than a Court, should take a 
statute as it is written; it should turn square corners in administering 
laws. The statutory criteria, as applied to the facts of this case, 
dictate that the application should be denied.

Dissenting Statement of Governor Maisel 
I share the view that the anticompetitive effects of Applicant's 
proposal are not outweighed by any other considerations presented in 
the record, and therefore join with Governor Robertson in dissenting from 
the Board's action. 
It is true that a more balanced banking structure in the State 
of Connecticut could result in a healthier competitive environment 
in banking markets throughout the State. But that does not suggest 
that any proposal which an Applicant might conceive to strengthen 
a moderate-sized competitor warrants approval because of that fact; 
it is the proposal's total effect on competition which must be considered. 
In the present case, the Applicant, the first bank holding company to 
be formed in Connecticut, had a wide range of possible alternatives which 
would have equally accomplished any beneficial effects from its formation. 
It chose the most anticompetitive of them. Any weight in favor of 
approval which could be accorded the beneficial effects fails to offset 
the anti-competitive impact of the procedure selected. 
An organization resulting from a combination of three banks 
of the size of those involved in the present case, but located in 
separate markets, would possess the same financial and managerial 
strength as Applicant will possess, without reducing the number of 
competitive alternatives in any market. Additionally, such a 
combination would result in strengthening a moderate-sized competitor 
in each of three markets involved, rather than only in one, as here. 

A proposal such as Applicant's, which joins competing moderate-sized 
banks is actually counter-productive to the attainment of a balanced 
banking structure, because it reduces the likelihood that a multi-
market organization will be able to find in Hartford a suitable vehicle 
for participation in that market. 
A particularly disturbing aspect of the proposal is the 
effect of the "home office protection" feature of Connecticut law, 
which fails to distinguish between an independent bank and a holding 
company subsidiary. 
The result is that the proposed holding company, 
in addition to its other advantages, will be preserved from competition 
in sub-markets served by its subsidiaries. This is an advantage which 
even the two largest banks in the State do not possess with respect 
to their branching areas. 
In Simsbury, the effect will be to perpetuate 
a condition whereby local residents and businesses are denied the con-
venience and competitive advantages of alternative banking facilities 
which almost certainly would develop within the community if the area 
Were opened to branching by other banks. Although this inequitable 
situation results from a peculiarity of State law, rather than the holding 
company format per se, it is an effect which cannot reasonably be ignored 
in determining the public interest with respect to a holding company 
Proposal arising in such a State. 
In the absence of any publicly beneficial effects which could 
n
°t be accomplished in a less anticompetitive manner, I would deny the

Subject: General adjustment to the 
Division of Personnel Administration 
Board's regular salary schedule._ 
/ 
/ . 
The Congress has approved and President Nixon is expected to 
sign into law the "Federal Employees Salary Act of 1970", retroactive 
to the first day of: the first pay period which began on or after 
December 27, 1969* 
The effective date for the Board, if approved, would 
therefore be December 28, 1969. The law provides an across-the-board 
general increase of approximately 6 per cent. 
Recommendations 
Salary Structure 
. 
In keeping with the Board's policy of maintaining its employees 
salary structure comparable to that of other agencies of the Federal 
Government, and, on the assumption that President Nixon will approve the 
Salary Act, it is recommended that the Board approve the attached revision 
of its regular salary schedule, effective December 28, 1969, This schedule 
is identical with the revised Government General Schedule 0 
The Controller's Office recommends approval of any overexpendi-
tures? in the 1970 Salary, and Employee Retirement and Insurance Benefits 
budgetary accounts resulting from approval of this proposal. 
Thrift Plan 
The Board approved contributions to this plan by its employees 
°f up to 10 per cent of basic salary, with payments by the Board of a 
matching contribution equal to 25 per cent of employees' contributions up 
to a maximum of 1-1/2 per cent of the participating employee's basic 
salary c 
It is recommended that the current employees' contribution rates 
a
l s o be applied to the retroactive pay and that the Board match these con-
tributions in the same manner as it matches contributions for current pay. 
Implementation 
In connection with the implementation of this recommendation, 
the following administrative procedures are recommended, as in similar pay 
S c
h e d u l e changes in the past: 

To: 
Board of Governors 
- 2 -
1237 
(1) With the approval of the Board Member in charge 
of internal administrative affairs, the Division 
of Personnel Administration shall be responsible 
for making appropriate exceptions in individual 
cases and also adjustments in the per diem and 
hourly rates of the WAE (when actually employed) 
employees, etc„, including the pay status of the 
four employees in the Board's staff who are in 
"special rate" categories (two nurses and two 
accountants). 
(2) The Office of the Controller and the Division of 
Personnel Administration will use Government regu-
lations and interpretations as guides in deciding 
questions of administration and procedures» 
In July 1969, the Board approved a 3 per cent increase in 
the structure for FR-1 employees although the Government's schedule 
did not provide any increases for that grade. It is now recommended 
that we adopt the Federal schedule, in full, and, In order that, employees 
in grade FR-1 may receive the full 6 per cent increase, we recommend 
they receive a one-step increase as well as the structure change. 
The 
result will be exactly 6 per cent increase for these eight employees, 
or $243 each on an annual basis. 
No salary rate adjustments are included in this recommenda-
tion for Board employees paid under the Metropolitan D. C. Prevailing 
Rate Wage Schedule (mechanics, gardeners, painters, chauffeurs, 
laborers, cafeteria employees, etc.) or the Interdepartmental Litho-
graphic Wage Board Pay Schedule (offset press operators, mimeograph 
operators, etc.). These employees receive periodic salary adjustments 
(usually in November) as a result of annual wage surveys. 
No recommendations are made in this memorandum with regard 
to the annual salaries of the Board's official staff. 
It is assumed 
that: any determinations on this matter will be made by the Board, as 
in the past.
