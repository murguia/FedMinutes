Minneapolis building program (Item No. 1). There had been 
distributed a memorandum dated May 28, 1969, from the Division of 
Federal Res erve Bank Operations regarding the expressed desire of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to move ahead with its 
building program. Last summer the Board had considered and noted 
without objection the general design concept of the new Bank 
building. 
Final plans had been reviewed by the Division and by 
the security and architectural consultants and found to be satis-
factory. The Board had recently decided to treat the Cincinnati, 
Memphis, and Minneapolis programs in the same fashion, i.e., to 
express the Board's view that all new construction should be postponed 
except that of the highest priority. Then, if the directors of those 
Banks decided to proceed with the respective programs, they should be 
prepared to defend the priority that they had accorded the projects. 
The remaining item that required attention by the Board was 
the budget for the proposed new building. Refined estimates of total 
cost indicated an increase of 9.8 per cent over the figures submitted 
in August 1968. The Bank now expected the guaranteed maximum price 
of the building to be negotiated at around $27.8 million, but was 
assured that in any event the price would not exceed $30.9 million.

The cost per square foot, including vault cost, was expected to be 
$45.24. The unit cost for this project, based on a total cost of 
$27.8 million, would be one of the highest of any construction pro-
gram undertaken by the System. Therefore, it was suggested that the 
Board urge the Bank to make every effort to effect economies that 
would not do violence to the basic concept of the building. A draft 
of telegram to the Bank was attached. 
Governor Mitchell stated that President Galusha had indicated 
that the direct ors of the Reserve Bank thought the project was one of 
highest priority. Governor Maisel, who had visited the Minneapolis 
Bank at the time of the directors' discussion, added that there had 
been an expectation of legal difficulties, which he described, if 
the project did not go forward at this time. 
At the request of Governor Robertson, Mr. Mcintosh commented 
on the estimated cost per square foot, compared with costs of buildings 
at Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Memphis. Among other things, the cost 
at Minneapolis reflected high labor rates, design characteristics, 
and underground garage construction. The price of $27.8 million was 
based on granite facing, although the bidding documents included an 
alternate for precast concrete that would cut about $1 million from 
the cost. President Galusha wanted to retain that option for possible 
use if bids on the general contract were out of line with estimates.

not find sufficient justification for going against the views of 
the directors. 
The telegram to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was 
thereupon approved unanimously. A copy is attached as Item No. 1. 
Amendments to margin regulations (over-the-counter stocks). 
In February the Board had published for comment proposed revisions 
of its margin regulations to implement the Over-the-Counter Margin 
Act (P.L. 90-437). There had now been distributed a memorandum dated 
May 15, 1969, from the staff suggesting further revisions in the light 
of comments received. 
At today's meeting the staff summarized the comments, changes 
that the staff recommended, and a suggested time-table for implementing 
the amendments. 
It was noted that the comments had been generally favorable. 
A number of respondents had taken the opportunity to suggest that other 
features of margin regulation be changed, but most of these collateral 
proposals had been put aside for later consideration. There were still 
some feelings of uneasiness about the make-up of the list of over-the-
counter stocks that would be made subject to margin requirements. The 
New York Reserve Bank and some bankers preferred that most--perhaps a l l -
over-the-counter stocks be subject to margin requirements at banks. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, on the other hand, preferred that the list of over-
the-counter stocks on which brokers could lend contain even fewer 
stocks than the list now proposed by the Board's staff.

Market makers could not begin to register, of course, until 
the list of OTC margin stocks was published. If all credit to market 
makers were suspended during the time it took them to register, there 
might be an adverse effect on the OTC market. Therefore, the staff 
recommended that exempt credit remain available to market makers for 
a further 30 days after the list was published, such exemption to 
apply to all brokers and dealers. 
On administering the market-maker exemption, the New York 
Clearing House had suggested that a lending bank be permitted to 
rely on the market maker's assurance that he was a registered broker/ 
dealer, that he had registered with the Commission as a market maker 
in the stocks he specified, and that he was using the credit obtained 
under that exemption to make a market in the stocks. As to the first 
and second points, the staff felt that this procedure left too much 
room for possible abuse. It was proposed that the market maker mail 
a simple form to the Commission, giving the names of the OTC margin 
stocks in which he intended to make a market. The Commission would 
transmit the names currently to the Board and they would be wired to 
the Federal Reserve Banks, which would maintain a list, possibly in 
a card file. When a firm approached a bank for a line of credit on 
an OTC margin stock, the bank would telephone the Reserve Bank to 

1 8 2 6 
6/2/69 
- 7 -
verify that the borrower was a registered broker/dealer and registered 
as a market maker in that particular stock. When a market maker 
ceased to make a market in a stock, he would mail the same kind of 
form to the SEC, giving the names of the banks at which he was cur-
rently borrowing. The SEC would transmit this information to the 
Board's staff, who would send it to the Reserve Bank of the District 
of each bank involved. The Reserve Bank would notify the bank, 
which would then transfer any credit on the stock to the firm's 
trading account. 
As to the third point raised by the New York Clearing House, 
the staff proposed that the market maker supply a simplified form of 
purpose statement (Form U-2), and that a bank be entitled to rely on 
the statement. The New York Reserve Bank had discussed the form with 
representative bankers, who had not felt it would create any significant 
problems. 
The staff felt that the changes recommended to reflect the 
comments received were sufficiently significant that the amendments 
should not be effective immediately, but should be made effective 30 
days after publication. There had been a number of suggestions that 
the list of stocks be published at the same time as the amendments, 
so that investors would have time to rearrange their portfolios. 
However, the staff did not recommend this, because it could facilitate 
positioning on a low-margin basis, which might disturb the functioning 
of the OTC markets. 
Instead, the staff recommended that the list be 

1827 
6/2/69 
- 8 -
published at the end of the 30-day period when the amendments became 
effective. 
A decision by the Board also was needed with respect to apply-
ing the regulations to loans on over-the-counter stocks that were 
outstanding at the time the amendments went into effect. In the past 
the Board generally had taken the position that outstanding loans 
became subject to the retention and withdrawal requirements but did 
not have to be brought up to a fully margined status. A stricter 
view had been taken when margin requirements were made applicable to 
loans on convertible bonds, because of conditions in the convertible 
bond market at the time. When Regulation G was adopted, on the other 
hand, it had been made applicable only to loans made after its 
effect ive date. In the present case, the staff recommended that 
the Board adopt the more lenient course. The amendments now proposed 
would cause about 300 stocks suddenly to become subject to margin 
requirements. 
Banks had indicated that a considerable burden would 
result if they had to review all old loans that might conceivably be 
subject to the regulation, and the staff had no indication that the 
volume of credit on OTC margin stocks was great enough to justify 
imposing such a burden. 
The proposed amendments would make a significant change with 
respect to special omnibus accounts--a wholesale-type of account in 
which brokers handle transactions on an exempt basis for other brokers' 
retail customers, with the other broker applying margin requirements.

lender was a wholly-controlled trustee; and (2) indicating that the 
financing arrangements need not be part of the plan documents. 
Today's discussion centered first on the treatment of out-
standing loans. In response to questions whether it might be feasible 
to set a time limit for such loans to be worked off, the staff 
ind icated that most of the loans would be worked off normally in a 
relatively short time. The problem in setting a time limit was that 
it would be difficult to identify the loans. Heretofore, in the 
absence of margin regulations applying to OTC stocks, banks had no 
obligation to record the fact that a loan was made to purchase or 
carry such stocks. 
Although Governors Robertson and Mitchell would have pre-
ferred to set some limit on the time outstanding loans could be 
continued without margin, they did not formally oppose adoption of 
the staff recommendation. 
The discussion then turned to the market maker exemption. 
In response to questions, it was brought out that the proposed 
procedures would provide information indicating what dealer was 
borrowing from what banks and on what stock. Any further information 
needed could then be requested of particular firms. 
Governor Maisel questioned whether the information would be 
of sufficient use to justify the cumbersome procedures and record-
keeping required. It seemed to him that to a great extent it was 
necessary to rely on good faith. That would suggest using only the 

1830 
6/2/69 
-11-
U-2 form, which provided a simplified purpose statement. 
Governor 
Mitchell also raised questions whether certain alternatives would 
not be feasible. 
After staff comments on this point, Chairman Martin expressed 
the view that, since the SEC staff had agreed to the procedures pro-
posed, it would seem desirable at least to experiment with them. If 
they proved unsatisfactory, they could be changed. Governor Sherrill 
said it seemed likely that whatever method was used initially, it 
would have to be modified in the light of experience. Therefore, he 
would be willing to begin with the methods proposed. 
Governor Maisel commented that he would prefer to experiment 
in the direction of accepting representations of market makers on 
trust. He did not see what great loss there would be to the regulatory 
system in avoiding a complicated procedure. 
In any event, there 
would be a check at the time the lending bank was examined. 
Chairman Martin inquired whether it might be worthwhile to 
explore with the SEC the possibility of dropping the reporting 
mechanisms proposed. He was in favor of full cooperation with the 
Commission in establishing the procedures, because in some respects 
it had a greater responsibility in this area than the Board. 
Further discussion developed an understanding that in the 
month before the amendments became effective, the staff would work 
with the Commission's staff to see if a less cumbersome arrangement 
could be devised.

The Board thereupon approved the amendments to Regulations G, 
T, and U, effective July 8, 1969, Governor Maisel dissenting with 
respect to the changes intended to clarify the provisions relating 
to stock option plans. It was understood that the initial list of 
over-the-counter stocks subject to margin would be published on 
July 8, 1969, and that market makers would be allowed an additional 
30 days beyond July 8 to establish their status as such in order to 
qualify for exempt credit. Attached under Item No. 2 are copies of 
the press release announcing the Board's action and the revised 
Regulations G, T, and U incorporating the amendments. 
The Board also approved unanimously a staff recommendation, 
included in the documentation supporting the proposed amendments, 
that publication of the List of Registered Stocks and of Investment 
Companies, heretofore published in connection with the margin regula-
tions, be discontinued. 
Amendments to margin regulations (equity funding). In 
December 1968 the Board had published for comment proposals to amend 
Regulations G and U to impose an 80 per cent margin requirement on 
credit used in connection with equity funding plans or programs. Also 
proposed was a change in Regulation T that would prevent selling equity 
funding on credit. 

1833 
6/2/69 
- 1 4 -
The proposals were republished with the over-the-counter 
margin proposals in February 1969. Organizations engaged in equity 
funding had objected on the grounds that they would be unable to 
operate under the proposed 80 per cent margin and that the imminence 
of the cut-off date for comments would disrupt their sales operations. 
They requested an extension of time and an opportunity to present 
their case to the Board. Accordingly, the Board extended the time 
for comment and held an oral presentation on February 26. There had 
now been distributed a memorandum dated May 26, 1969, in which the 
staff reappraised the proposals in the light of the oral presentation 
and the comments received, and submitted revised recommendations. 
The term "equity funding" had been used by the industry to 
describe the sale of mutual funds and insurance in a package, the 
premiums being financed by a loan against the shares. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission had held that such a program was a "security" 
that must be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act

°f 1933. Programs were sold subject to a strict "suitability" rule 
of the Commission designed to insure that the amount of securities 
and insurance purchased was not disproportionate to the customer's

nected with the life insurance industry strongly supporting the 
proposal published for comment, most of the comments came from sources 
related to equity funding interests and were adverse. The adverse

I 
arguments seemed to fall into two basic categories: 
first, that the 
Board had no power to regulate the loans; second, that the activity 
was socially desirable. 
The staff believed that (1) the programs must be regarded, 
in at least one important aspect, as embodying "purpose" loans; 
(2) while the amount and character of credit involved might not be 
significant enough at this time to warrant imposition of full margin 
requirements, leaving the programs entirely outside margin regulation 
would create a serious potential for a new kind of credit expansion 
in the securities field; and (3) it should be possible to find a 
compromise that would permit the equity funding industry to continue 
to operate without serious dislocation, yet provide a technique for 
future control if needed, and forestall the spread of similar selling 
methods (perhaps at much lower margins) in other areas. 
The staff now recommended that equity funding plans or 
programs be brought under margin regulation, but that, in view of 
their insurance aspect, a special loan value of 40 per cent (60 per 
cent initial margin) be granted to mutual fund shares pledged under 
such programs. This figure would correspond to the special loan 
value now available for convertible bonds. 
Industry representatives 
had agreed that such a solution would be acceptable. 
In the form in which the equity funding proposals were 
Published with the over-the-counter margin proposals, Regulation T 
would have been extended to cover brokers and dealers who were neither 

1835 
6/2/69 
- 1 6 -
members of a national securities exchange nor transacted a business 
in securities through the medium of such a member. Sellers of equity 
funding programs fell into the class of brokers and dealers that would 
be newly subject to Regulation T as a result of that amendment. 
Since 
Regulation T forbids lending or arranging loans against mutual fund 
shares, the result would be to make it impossible for the equity 
funding companies to continue in operation. This result had been 
recognized, but the provision was considered necessary under the 
over-the-counter proposals. One purpose in holding the oral presen-
tation of February 26 had been to elicit suggestions from the industry 
for reconciling the conflicting objectives, and a proposal had been 
developed for a "special account" under Regulation T, in which nothing 
but the financing of equity funding programs could be arranged, and 
which could be made available only by brokers and dealers who extended 
or arranged no other credit. The staff recommended that such a 
special provision be included in Regulation T. 
Among other attachments to the memorandum were drafts of 
amendments to Regulations G, T, and U reflecting the staff recommen-
dations . 
At the beginning of today's discussion the staff commented 
on the recommendations and their rationale. 
Governor Maisel expressed the view that the staff presentation 
was excellent. He agreed with the staff's conclusions except that, 
as a matter of policy, he thought the Board should not inject margin

Regulation Z. Governor Robertson referred to a potential 
problem with respect to the effective date of Regulation Z, Truth 
in Lending. The regulation required lenders to be in a position 
to provide relevant information by July 1. The firms engaged in 
printing forms and charts for use by lenders in this connection 
had earlier indicated that they expected to be able to fill all 
orders received by that date. Now, however, the backlog of such 
orders appeared so great that many would go unfilled until later in 
the summer. The practical effect of such delay would be violation 
of the regulation for a time by lenders not receiving the ordered 
materials. Governor Robertson indicated it was possible that prac-
tical consideration would lead him to recommend to the Board an 
amendment to Regulation Z that would relieve this temporary violation, 
so long as good faith efforts to comply had been made. He said 

1838

he wished to alert the Board to this possibility in case some imple-
menting amendment had to be acted upon on short notice. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Board has reviewed revised cost estimates on proposed building

In view of high unit cost of this structure, 
every effort should be made to effect economies that would not do 
violence to basic concept of building. 
With regard to timing question, Board is of the opinion that under 
current economic conditions all new construction except that of 
highest priority should be postponed. 
Board's basic position on 
this matter was stated in its press release of April 9 in which it 
announced that construction of Board's annex building was being

Item No. 2 
6/2/69 
For release in morning papers 
j u n e 6, 196^. 
Monday, June 9, 1969 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced 
tcday the criteria to be employed in selecting "over-the-counter" (OTC) 
stocks that v/ill become subject to its margin regulations under an 
A c t (P. L. 90-437) adopted by Congress last year. 
A number of changes in the regulations were also adopted to 
implement the legislation. These changes are based upon proposals 
*hich were published for comment on February 10, 1969. 
Interested 
Persons were asked to submit their comments in writing by March 57, 
^ 0 9 , and the proposals have been revised in the light of the comments 
received. 
Margin regulations generally limit the amount of credit 
* Perron or firm may obtain to buy securities. 
In the past these 
re£ula!:ions applied to stocks that were registered on the national 
securities exchanges. 
In announcing the amendments to its Regula-
tions G, T and U, the Board said the initial list of over-the-counter 
® t o c k s subject to margin will be published on July 8, 1969, the date 
t he amendments become effective. 
Regulation G applies to credit provided by persons other 
t h a n kanks, brokers or dealers to purchase or carry equity securities, 
Regulation T concerns credit by brokers, dealers and members of 

1841 
- 2 -
national securities exchanges for the same purpose while Regulation U 
applies to credit by banks. 
The amendments also: 
— Exempt from margin regulation bank loans to broker-dealers 
against inventory positions in OTC stocks when such credit is used to 
nake a bona fide market in those stocks. A similar exemption is already 
bailable to specialists making a market in stocks registered on 
_ 
t 
e x c h a n g e s . 
-Broaden the definition of "creditor" in Regulation T to 
c°ver all brokers and dealers and thus bring under the new margin 
requirements all brokers and dealers who now handle OTC accounts 
e x c l u s i v e l y . 
— Limit the exemption from margin regulation available through 
a fecial omnibus account to members of national stock exchanges and 
brokers and dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission. 
--Clarify the application of Regulations G and U to loans on 
Mutual funds. 
Regulation T prohibits loans on mutual fund shares. 
Under the criteria announced today OTC stocks subject to 
a r&in requirements would have characteristics similar to stocks 
Sistered on national exchanges. 
This would include a degree of 
ational investor interest, a depth and breadth of market, availability 
i 

1 8 4 2 
- 3 -
of information respecting individual stocks and the character and 
permanence of the issuers. 
Margin requirements will apply only to loans made after the 
amendments become effective to purchase or carry OTC stocks on the 
Federal Reserve list or debt securities convertible into such stocks. 
Criteria used to determine which broker-dealers are entitled 
to the market-maker exemption are designed to ensure, as far as possi-
ble, that the firm does in fact make a market in the stock, stands 
ready at all times (within reason) to buy or sell the stock, and does 
not unjustifiably "back away" from the market. 
Banks lending to such 
market-makers would have to obtain a statement on a new form, F.R.U-2, 
that the credit was in fact being used to carry out the market-making 
function. 
The bank could rely on the statement, if accepted in good 
faith. 
Any registered broker-dealer will be eligible for designation 
as an "OTC market maker" if he meets the standards set forth in 
Regulation U, files with the Securities and Exchange Commission a 
notice of his intent to begin or continue such market-making activity 
r 
and continues to file such other reports as are required pursuant to 
a rule to be adopted by the SEC respecting market makers in OTC margin 
stocks. To provide continuous market operations, without an interruption 
in credit, the amendments provide for an additional 30 days after 
-

- 4 -
publication of the OTC margin list within which those dealers wishing 
to qualify for the exemption may file with the SEC. 
During the 30-day 
period, margin requirements will not apply to bank credit extended on 
the OTC margin stocks to brokers and dealers registered with the SEC. 
Sjjjcial Omnibus Account 
After the effective date of the amendments, credit not 
subject to margin requirements will be available through a special 
omnibus account only to members of national stock exchanges and brokers 
and dealers registered with the SEC. Under the present Regulation T, 
this type of credit can be extended to persons, including foreign firms, 
vho merely certify that they observe the regulation even though they are 
not subject to it. 
By use of a special omnibus account, a member of an exchange 
^ay make wholesale transactions for other brokers without regard to 
margin requirements. 
These transactions involve securities on which 
margin requirements have already been imposed at the retail level. 
Under the amendments, the privilege of using the special 
°^nibus account will no longer be available to organizations, 
includi ng foreign financial institutions and others, that prefer to 
rcmain unregistered. 
Most firms borrowing in special omnibus accounts 
not be affected by the amendments. 
In the case of accounts of 
.unre.gj gteioH persons, no further substitutions of collateral will be . 

1844 
- 5 -
permitted after 90 days from the effective date of the amendments. 
Credit extended in such accounts will have to be brought up to margin 
requirements within a year. 
Jv^ijt" 
• .';) f ' f . • 
Last December, the Department of Justice and the SEC presented 
t o the House Banking and Currency Committee evidence of abuses whereby 
special omnibus accounts had been used by some foreign financial 
institutions to avoid U.S. margin requirements, 
j g a n ^ o n j t u t u a l 
F u n ^ s 
As part of the amendments, the Board incorporated a provision 
°riginally proposed last December to clarify the applicability of Regu-
lations G and U to loans on mutual funds. Under present regulations, 
^°ans by banks and Regulation G lenders for purchasing or carrying 
mutual. fund shares are subject to margin requirements only if the fund's 
Portfolio "customarily includes" securities that would themselves be 
Subject to margin requirements. 
It has been found that this criterion, 
specially when the OTC margin stocks are added, embraces virtually all 
Mutual funds. Under the new provision, the margin regulations will 
aPPly to loans to purchase or carry all mutual funds, unless 95 per 
C ° n t 
the assets are invested in "exempted securities"--largely 
6everr.me.nt issues. 
Because the new test can be applied objectively 
includes the vast majority of mutual funds, the Board will cease 
.Publication 0 £ i t s list of securities subject to margin regulations. 
i 

A number of other conforming changes of a technical nature 
ate also made throughout the regulations as necessary or appropriate. 
Unrelated Changes 
Clarifying changes unrelated to implementing P. L. 90-437 were 
made in one section of Regulation G regarding stock option and employee 
etock purchase plans. 
These changes : 
— M a k e it clear that "plan-lenders" under such plans must be 
both wholly owned and controlled by the corporation involved. The only 
exceptions are for a trustee or a credit union, or a plan-lender formed 
Prior to February 1, 1968, the date when the Board announced adoption 
Regulation G in final form. 
--Exempt from margin requirements credit extended by a 
Plan-lender to finance the exercise of "qualified" or "restricted" 
option rights granted prior to February 1, 1968. 
--Make clear that the credit arrangements for such plans 
^ e d not be part of the plan itself. 
"-State that an increase in the current market value of stock 
Uoed as collateral for a loan may be taken into account in determining 
^ ether the stock may be sold, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of, 
In other unrelated changes, the time for retaining Federal 
B 
'serve Forms G-3 and U-l (the "purpose statements" required by 

1846 
- 7 -
Regulations G and U) would be reduced from six to three years to ease 
V!

the burden of retaining records, and a new Federal Reserve Form T-4 
vill be substituted for the written statements now obtained by brokers

and dealers in connection with "non-purpose" extensions of credit when 
regulated securities are used as collateral.

or indirectly, in whole or in part, by collateral that 
includes any such security, is a "lender" subject to 
this part and shall not after February 1, 1968. ex-
cept as provided in § 207.4(a), extend or arrange 
for the extension of any purpose credit in an amount 
exceeding the maximum loan value of the collateral, 
as prescribed from time to time for margin securi-
l'cs in § 207.5 (the Supplement to Regulation G), 
or as determined by the lender in good faith for any 
collateral other than margin securities: 
Provided, 
That credit extended before July 8, 1969, for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying OTC margin 
stock and/or debt securities convertible into such 
s{ock shall not be deemed to be purpose credit: And 
Provided further. 
That any collateral consisting of 
convertible securities described in paragraph (d) of 
this section shall have ioan value only as provided 
, n that paragraph. 
(d) Credit on convertible debt securities. (1) A 
lender may extend credit for the purpose specified 
l n P a r agraph (c) of this section on collateral con-
sisting of any debt security (i) convertible with or 
W 
o u t consideration, presently or in the future, 
mto a margin security or (ii) carrying any warrant 
0 r nght to subscribe to or purchase such a margin 
security (such a convertible debt security is some-
times referred to herein as a -convertible security"). 
(2) Credit extended under this paragraph shall 
subject to the same conditions as any other credit 
subject to this section except: (i) the entire amount 
° f such credit shall be considered a single credit 
'cated separately from the single credit specified in 
Paragraph (g) 0f this section and all the collateral 
securing such credit shall be considered in determin-
e s whether or not the credit complies with this part, 
ail(J (n) the maximum loan value of the collateral 
s all be as prescribed 
from 
time 
to time 
in 
20/.5(b) (the Supplement to Regulation G ) . 
^ O ) Any convertible security originally eligible 
L c<j',,ateral for credit extended under this paragraph 
a be treated as such as long as continuously held 
^collateral for such credit even though it ceases to 
convertible or to carry warrants or rights. 
(4) In the event that any margin security other 
a n a convertible security is substituted for a con-

duced by an amount equal to the maximum loan 
value of the security withdrawn. 
(e) Statements as to purpose of credit. (1) In con-
nection with any extension of credit secured directly 
or indirectly, in whole or in part, by collateral that 
includes any margin security, every person who is 
subject to the registration requirement of paragraph 
(a) of this section shall, prior to such extension, ob-
tain a statement in conformity with the requirements 
of Federal Reserve Form G-3 executed by the cus-
tomer and executed and accepted in good faith by 
such person. Such person shall retain such statement 
in his records for at least 3 years after such credit 
is extinguished. In determining whether credit is 
"purpose credit", such person may rely on the state-
ment executed by the customer if accepted in good 
faith. To accept the customer's statement in good 
faith, such person must (i) be alert to the circum-
stances surrounding the credit and (ii) if he has any 
further information which would cause a prudent 
man not to accept the statement without inquiry, 
have investigated and be satisfied that the customer's 
statement is truthful. 
(2) Circumstances which could indicate 
that 
such person has not exercised reasonable diligence 
in so investigating and so satisfying himself would 
include, but are not Iimiled to, facts such as that (i) 
the proceeds of the credit were paid to a broker or 
to a bank in connection with contemporaneous de-
livery of margin securities, whether or not payment 
was made against delivery, (ii) there were frequent 
substitutions of margin securities serving as collateral 
for the credit, or (iii) the amount of the credit was 
disproportionate, or the terms inappropriate, to the 
stated purpose. 
(0 Credit extended to person subject to Regula-
tion T. (1) No lender shall extend or maintain any 
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any 
margin security to any customer who is subject to 
Part 220 of this Chapter (Regulation T) without 
collateral or on collateral consisting of margin secu-
rities (other than exempted securities3). Where the 
credit is to be used in the ordinary course of busi-
ness of such customer, such credit is presumed to 
be for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin 
securities unless the lender has in his records a 
statement to the contrary obtained and executed in 
conformity with the requirements of paragraph (e) 
of this section. 
(2) The prohibition of this paragraph (f) shall 
not apply to credit which is unsecured or secured by 
3 A s defined in 15 U.S.C. 7 8 c ( a ) ( 1 2 ) .

collateral other than margin securities, and which is 
(i) made to a dealer' to aid in the distribution of 
securities to customers not through the medium of 
a national securities exchange, or (ii) subordinated 
to the claims of general creditors by a subordination 
agreement approved by an appropriate committee 
of a national securities exchange or by a "satisfac-
tory subordination agreement" as defined in para-
graph ( c ) ( 7 ) of Rule 15c3-l of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission 
(17 CFR 2-40.15c3-l (c) 
( 7 ) ) . 
(g) Combining purpose credit extended to the 
same customer. For the purpose of this part, except 
for a credit subject to paragraph (d) of this section 
and § 207.4(a)(2), the aggregate of all outstanding 
Purpose credit extended to a customer by a lender 
after February 1, 1968, shall be considered a single 
credit and, except as provided in paragraphs (d) 
a nd (i) of this section, all the collateral securing 
such a credit, whether directly or indirectly, in whole 
o r 
m part, shall 
be considered 
in 
determining 
whether the credit complies with this part. 
(h) Purpose and nonpurposc credit extended to 
<'ie same person. No lender shall after February 1, 
196S, extend or arrange for the extension of any 
purpose credit, or maintain or arrange for the 
maintenance of any purpose credit extended after 
February 1, 1968, if the credit is secured directly 
or indirectly, in whole or in part, by collateral that 
'ncludes any margin security which also secures, 
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any other 
credit in excess of $5,000 extended to the same cus-
tomer after February 1, 1968; and no lender shall 
nave outstanding at the same time to the same cus-
tomer both such purpose credit and any such other 
c redit: Provided, That the prohibitions of this para-
graph shall not apply to (i) credit extended for the 
purpose of purchasing, constructing, maintaining, or 
improving a dwelling which is occupied or to be 
occupied by the customer as his principal residence 
when such credit is securcd by a first lien on such 
welling; or (ii) credit secured by a share account 
or other claim a;quired by the customer from the 
,ei>der independently of the credit and payable (or 
entitling the holder to a loan thereon) in a dollar 
amount determined without regard to the market 
Vd 
e o f the assets supporting the claim.

*es and by other collateral. In the case of any pur-
C r c' d i t extended or arranged after February 1,

• Sccured directly or indirectly, in whole or in 
E i ^ b y a n y margin security, no other collateral shall

have any loan value in respect to such credit for the 
purpose of this part: Provided, 
however, 
That a 
share account or other claim acquired by the cus-
tomer from the lender independently of the credit 
and payable (or entitling the holder to a loan there-
on) in a dollar amount determined without regard 
to the market value of the assets supporting the 
claim shall have a maximum loan value as deter-
mined by the lender in good faith. 
(j) Withdrawals and substitutions of collateral. 
(1) General rule. Fxcept as permitted by the next 
subparagraph and by § 207.4(a), while a lender 
maintains any purpose credit extended after Feb-
ruary 1, 1968, the lender shall not at any time per-
mit any withdrawal or substitution of collateral un-
less either (i) the credit would not exceed the 
maximum loan value of the collateral aftei such 
withdrawal or substitution, or (ii) the credit is 
reduced by at least the amount by which the maxi-
mum loan value of any collateral deposited is less 
than the "retention requirement" of any collateral 
withdrawn. The retention requirement of collateral 
other than margin securities is the same as its maxi-
mum loan value and the retention requirement of 
collateral consisting of margin securities or debt 
securities convertible into margin securities is pre-
scribed from time to time in § 207.5 (the Supple-
ment to Regulation G ) . 
(2) Same-day 
substitution 
of collateral. 
Except 
as prohibited by § 207.4(a) a lender may permit a 
substitution of margin securities effected by a pur-
chase and sale on orders executed within the sr.me 
day: Provided, That (i) if the proceeds of the sale 
exceed the total cost of the purchase, the credit is 
reduced by at least an amount equal to the retention 
requirement in respect to the sale less the reten-
tion requirement in respect to the purchase, or (ii) 
if the total cost of the purchase exceeds the pro-
ceeds of the sale, the credit may be increased by an 
amount no greater than the maximum loan value of 
the securities purchased less the maximum loan 
value of the securities sold. If the maximum loan 
value of the collateral securing the credit has become 
less than the amount of the credit, the amount of 
the credit may nonetheless be increased if there is 
provided additional collateral having maximum loan 
value at least equal to the amount of increase, or 
the credit is extended pursuant to § 207.4(a).

such security. 
(f) OTC margin stock. (1) The term "OTC 
margin stock" means stock not traded on a national 
securities exchange which the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System has determined to

this part. 
(2) The Board will from time to time publish a 
list of OTC margin stocks as to which the Board has 
made the determinations described in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (f). Except as provided in 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph (f), such stocks 
shall meet the requirements of § 207.5(d)

is necessary or appropriate in the public interest. 
(5) It shall be unlawful for any person to make, 
or cause to be made, any representation to the effect 
that the inclusion of a security on such list of OTC 
margin stocks is evidence that the Board or the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission has in any way 
passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, 
such security or any transaction therein. Any state-
ment in an advertisement or other similar communi-
cation containing a refeience to the Board in con-

(i) The term "indirectly secured" includes, ex-
cept as provided in § 207.4(a) (3), any arrangement 
with the customer under which the customer's right 
or ability to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of 
margin securities owned by the customer is in any 
way restricted as long as the crcdit remains out-
standing, or under which the exercise of such right, 
whether by written agreement or otherwise, is or 
may be cause for acceleration of the maturity of 
the crcdit: Provided, 
That the foregoing shall not 
aPP'y (1) if such restriction arises solely by virtue 
of an arrangement with the customer which pertains 
generally to the customer's assets unless a substan-
tial part of such assets consists of margin securities, 
o r (2) if the lender in good faith has not relied upon 
such securities as collateral in the extension or main-
tenance of the particular crcdit: And 
provided 
further, That the foregoing shall not apply to stock 
held by the lender only in the capacity of custodian, 
depositary, or trustee, or under similar circum-
stances, if the lender in good faith has not relied

lender pursuant to such plan. 
(b) Extensions and renewals. The renewal or 
extension of maturity of a credit need not be 
treated as the extension of a credit if the amount 
of the credit is not increased except by the addition 
of interest or service charges on the credit or of 
taxes on transactions in connection with the credit. 
(c) Reorganization or recapitalization. Nothing 
in this part shall be construed to prohibit with-
drawal or substitution of securities to enable a

with this part due to a mechanical mistake made 
in good faith in determining, recording, or cal-
culating any credit, balance, market price, or loan 
value, or other similar mechanical mistake, shall 
not constitute a violation of this part if promptly 
after discovery of the mistake the lender takes 
whatever action is practicable to remedy the non-
compliance. 
(e) Arranging for credit. A lender may arrange 
for the extension or maintenance of crcdit by any 
person upon the same terms and conditions as 
those upon which the lender, under the provisions 
of this part, may himself extend or maintain such 
credit, but only upon such terms and conditions, 
except that this limitation shall not apply with 
respect to the arranging by a lender for a bank 
subject to Part 221 of th is Chapter (Regulation U) 
to extend or maintain credit on margin securities 
or exempted securities. 
(f) Combined purchase of mutual funds and 
insurance. An extension of purpose credit provided 
for in a plan, program, or investment contract,

mission under the Securities Act of 
1933 
(15 
U.S.C. 77), which provides for the acquisition both 
of a security issued by an investment 
company 
described in paragraph ( d ) ( 5 ) of § 207.2 and an 
insurance policy or contract, shall be subject to all 
the provisions of this part except that where the 
credit is secured by the security and docs not ex-
ceed the 
premiums on such 
policy 
(plus 
any 
applicable interest), the maximum loan value of 
such security shall be 40 per cent of its current 
market value, as determined by any reasonable 
method.

(2) The Board will from time to time publish a 
list of OTC margin stock as to which the Beard 
has made the determinations described in subpara-
graph (1) of this paragraph (e). Except as pro-

f rom or add any such stock to such list of OTC 
Margin stocks if in the judgment of the Board, 
Such action is necessary or appropriate in the pub-
he interest. 
(5) It shall be unlawful for any creditor to 
make, or cause to be made, any representation to 
the effect that the inclusion of a security on such

approval to, such security or any transaction there-
to- Any statement in an advertisement or other simi-
ar communication containing a reference to the

a creditor 
and 
a 
customer, 
whether recorded in one record or in more than 
one record, shall be included in and be deemed to 
be part of the customer's general account with the 
creditor, except that the relations which § 220.4 
permits to be included in any special account pro-
vided for by that section may be included in the ap-
propriate special account, and all transactions in 
commodities, and, except to the extent provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of § 220.3, all transactions in 
non-equity securities, exempted securities, and in 
other securities having no loan value in a general 
account under the provisions of § 220.3(c) and 
§ 220.8 (the Supplement to Regulation T) (except 
unissued securities, short sales and purchases to 
cover short sales, securities positions to oilset short 
sales, contracts involving an endorsement or guaran-
tee of any put, call, or other option), shall be in-
cluded in the appropriate special account provided 
for by § 220.4. During any period when such

convertible debt security account (sometimes re-
ferred to herein as "special convertible security 
account") subject to § 221.4(j), any transaction

for or with any customer in a general account, 
special bond account subject to § 220.4(i), or spe-

effected in such account on the same day, creates 
an excess of the adjusted debit balance of such 
account over the maximum loan value of 
the 
securities in such account, or increases any such 
excess, unless in connection therewith the creditor 
obtains, as promptly as possible and in any event 
before the expiration of 5 full business days follow-
ing the date of such transaction, the deposit into 
such account of cash or securities in such amount 
that the cash deposited plus the loan value of the 
securities deposited equals or excccds the excess so 
created or the increase so caused.

§ 220.5 
I860 
REGULATION 
T 
(2) Except as permitted in this subparagraph, 
no withdrawal of cash or exempted or 
margin 
securities shall be permissible it' the adjusted debit 
balance 
of 
the 
account 
(whether 
the 
general 
account, the special bond account, or the special 
convertible security account) 
would exceed the 
maximum loan value of the securities in such 
account after such withdrawal. The exceptions are 
available only in the event no cash or securities 
need to be deposited in such account in connec-
tion with a transaction on a previous day and none 
would need to be deposited thereafter in connec-
tion with any withdrawal of cash or securities on 
the current day.. The permissible exceptions are (i) 
registered ncn-equity securities or exempted securi-
ties held in the general account on March 
11, 
1968, and continuously thereafter may be with-
drawn upon the deposit in the account of cash 
(or margin equity securities counted at their maxi-
mum loan value) at least equal to the "retention 
requirement" cf such withdrawn securities, or (ii) 
except as provided in (i) cf this subparagraph, 
securities having loan value in the general account, 
the special bond account, or the special convertible 
security account may be withdrawn upon the de-
Posit in such account of cash or securities having 
loan value in such account counted at the maxi-
mum loan value at least equal to the "retention re-
quirement" of those securities, or (iii) cash may be 
withdrawn upon the deposit in the general account, 
the special bond account, or the special convertible 
security account of securities having a maximum 
loan value in such account at least equal to the 
amount of cash withdrawn, or (iv) upon the sale 
(other than the short sale) of securities having 
° an value in the general account, special bond 
aecount, or special convertible security 
account 
ere may be withdrawn in cash an amount equal 
to the difterence between the current market value 
j 
securities sold and the "retention require-
ent" of such securities, or (v) upon the sale 
v her than the short sale) of a registered non-
equity security or an exempted security that was 
h c l d in the general account on March 1 1, 1968, 
*ncl continuously thereafter there may be with-
aWn in cash an amount equal to the difference 
twecn the current market value of the securities 
and the "retention 
requirement" 
of 
those 
securities as prescribed in § 220.8 (the Supplement 
1 0 Regulation T ) . 
Rules for computing the maximum 
loan 
Va'uc of the securities in a general aecount, special 
bond account, or special convertible security ac-
count and the adjusted debit balance of such 
account are provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section, and certain modifications of and ex-
ceptions to the general rule stated in this paragraph 
are provided in the subsequent paragraphs of this 
section and in § 220.6. 
(c) Maximum loan value and current market 
value. (1) The maximum loan value of the securi-
ties in a general account, special bond account, or 
special convertible security account is the sum of 
the maximum loan values of the individual securi-
ties in such account, including securities 
(other 
than unissued securities) bought for such account 
but not yet debited thereto, but excluding securities 
sold for such account whether or not payment has 
been credited thereto. 
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this para-
graph, the maximum loan value of a security in a 
general account, special bond account, or special 
convertible security account shall be such maxi-
mum loan value as the Board shall prescribe from 
time to time in § 220.8 (the Supplement to Regula-
tion T). No collateral other than an exempted 
security or a registered non-equity security held in 
such account on March 11, 1968, and continuously 
thereafter, or margin equity security shall have any 
loan value in a general account except that a. 
margin equity security eligible for a special con-
vertible security account pursuant to § 220.4(j) 
shall have loan value in a general account only if 
held in the account on March 11, 1968, and con-
tinuously thereafter. 
(3) A warrant or certificate which evidences 
only a right to subscribe to or otherwise acquire 
any security and which expires within 90 days of 
issuance shall have no loan value in a general 
account, special bond account, or special 
con-
vertible security account; but, if the account con-
tains the security to the holder of which such 
warrant or certificate has been issued and such 
warrant or certificate is held in an appropriate 
account maintained by the creditor for the cus-
tomer the current market value of such security (if 
such security is a margin security) shall, for the 
purpose of calculating its maximum loan value, be 
increased by the current market value of such 
warrant or certificate. 
(4) For ihe current market value of a security 
throughout the day of its purchase or sale, the 
creditor shall use its total cost or the net proceeds 
of its sale, as the case may be, and at any other 
5 

REGULATION T 
§ 220.3 ' 
time shall use the closing sale price of the security 
on the preceding business day as shown by any 
regularly published reporting or quotation service. 
In the absence of any such closing sale price, the 
creditor may use any reasonable estimate of the 
market value of such security as of the close of 
business on such preceding business day. 
(d) Adjusted debit balance. For the purpose of 
this part, the adjusted debit balance of a general 
account, special bond account, or special con-
vertible security account shall be calculated by 
taking the sum of the following items: 
(1) the net debit balance, 
if any, of 
such 
account; 
(2) the total cost of any securities (other than 
unissued securities) bought for such account but 
not yet debited thereto; 
(3) the current market value of any securities 
(other than unissued securities) sold short in the 
general account 
plus, 
for each

fioard shall prescribe from time to time in § 220.8 
(the Supplement to Regulation T) as the margin 
required for such short sales, except that such 
amount so prescribed in such § 220.8 need not be 
•ncluded when there are held in the general account 
the same securities or securities exchangeable or 
convertible within 90 calendar days, without re-
striction other than the payment of money, into 
such securities sold short;

required margin) on each commitment in unissued 
securities; and 
(5) the amount of any margin customarily re-
quired by the creditor in connection with his en-
°rsement or guarantee of any put, call, or,other 
option; 
?nd deducting there from the sum of the following 
items: 
(6) the net credit balance, if anv, of such ac-
count; and 
(7) the net proceeds of sale of any securities

count but for which payment has not yet been 
credited thereto. 
case such account is the account of a partner of 
c creditor or the account of a joint venture in 
^hich the creditcr participates, the adjusted debit 
ance shall be computed according to the forego-
ing rule and the supplementary rules prescribed in 
§ 220.6(a) and (b). 
(e) Liquidation in lieu of deposit.3 In any case 
in which the deposit required by paragraph (b) of 
this section, or any portion thereof, is not obtained 
by the creditor within the 5-day period specified 
therein, margin non-exempted securities shall be 
sold (or, to the extent that there are insufficient 
margin non-exempted securities in the general ac-
count, special bond account, or special convertible 
security account other liquidating transactions shall 
be effected in such account), prior to the expiration 
of such 5-day period, in such amount that the re-
sulting decrease in the adjusted debit balance of such 
account exceeds, by an amount at least as great as 
such required deposit or the undeposited portion 
thereof, the "retention requirement" of any margin 
or exempted securities sold: Provided. That a credi-
tor is not required to sell securities or to effect other 
liquidating transactions specified by this paragraph 
in an amount greater than necessary to eliminate the 
excess of the adjusted debit balance of such account 
over the maximum loan value of the securities 
remaining in such account after such liquidation. 
(f) Extensions of time. In exceptional cases, the 
5-day period specified in paragraph (b) of this sec-
tion may, on application of the creditor, be extended 
for one or more limited periods commensurate with 
the circumstances ( l ) by any regularly constituted 
committee of a national securities exchange having 
jurisdiction over the business conduct of its mem-
bers, of which exchange the creditor is a member or 
through which his transactions arc effected, or (2) 
in instances where the procedure described above is 
not readily available or appropriate, by a committee 
of a national securities association: Provided, 
That 
such committee is satisfied that the creditor is act-
ing in good faith in making the application and that 
the circumstances are in fact exceptional and war-
rant such action. 
(g) Transactions on given day. For the purposes 
of paragraph (b) of this section, the question of 
whether or not an excess of the adjusted debit bal-
ance of a general account, special bond account, or 
special convertible security account over the maxi-
mum loan value of the securities in such account is 
created or increased on a given day shall be dctcr-
' T h i s requirement relates to the action to be taken when 
a customer fails to make the deposit required by § 220.3(b), 
and it is not intended to countenance on the part of cus-
tomers the practice commonly known as "free-riding," to 
prevent which the principal national securities exchanges 
have adopted certain rules. See the rules of such exchanges 
and § 220.7(e).

mined cn the basis of all the transactions in the 
account on such day exclusive of any deposit of 
cash, deposit of securities, covering transaction, or 
other liquidation that has been effected on such day, 
pursuant to the requirement of paragraphs (b) or 
(e) of this section, in connection with a transaction 
on a previous day. In any case in which an excess 
so created, or increase so caused, by transactions on 
a given day does not exceed $100, the creditor need 
not obtai n the deposit specified therefor in subpara-
graph (b) (1) of this section. Any transaction which 
serves to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of 
this section or otherwise serves to permit any off-
setting transaction in an account shall, to that ex-
tent, be unavailable to permit any other transaction 
m such account. For the purposes of this part (Reg-
ulation T), if a security has maximum loan value 
under subparagraph (c)(1) 
of this section in a 
general account, a sale of the same security (even 
though not the same certificate) in such account 
shall be deemed to be a long sale and shall not be 
deemed to be or treated as a short sale. 
(h) Unissued securities. (1) The amount to be 
included in the adjusted debit balance of a general 
account, special bond account, or special convertible 
security account as the margin required for a net 
long commitment in unissued securities shall be the 
current market value of the net amount of unissued 
securities long minus the maximum loan value which 
such net amount of securities would have if they 
^cre issued margin securities held in such account; 
?nd the amount to be so included as the margin re-
quired for a net short commitment in unissued se-
curities shall be the amount which would be required 
a s margin for the net amount of unissued securities 
short if such securities were issued securities and 
were sold short in such account: Provided, That no 
amount need be included as margin for a net short 
commitment in unissued securities when there are 
held in such account securities in respect of which 
{he unissued securities are to be issued, nor for any 
n e t position in unissued securities that are exempted 
securities. 
(2) Whenever a creditor, pursuant to a purchase 
an unissued secu rity for a customer, receives an 
issued security which is not a margin or exempted 
security, the creditor shall treat as the margin re-
quired for such purchase, any payment by the cus-
tomer for such issued security as a transaction (other 
than a withdrawal) which increases the adjusted 
debit balance of a general account, special bond ac-
count, or special convertible security account by the 
"mount of the payment minus the amount required 
to be included in the adjusted debit balance of such 
account, at the time of and in connection with the 
purchase of the unissued security. 
SECTION 220.4—SPECIAL 
ACCOUNTS 
(a) General rule. (1) Pursuant to this section, a 
creditor may establish for any customer one or more 
special accounts. 
(2) Each such special account shall be recorded 
separately and shall be confined to the transactions 
and relations specifically authorized for such ac-
count by the appropriate paragraph of this section 
and to transactions and relations incidental to those 
specifically authorized. An adequate record shall be 
maintained showing for each such account the full 
details of all transactions in the account. 
(3) A special account established pursuant to 
this section shall not be used in any way for the pur-
pose of evading or circumventing any of the provi-
sions of this part. If a customer has with a creditor 
both a general account and one or more such special 
accounts, the creditor shall treat each such special 
account as if the customer had with the creditor no 
general account, special bond account subject to 
§ 220.4(i), or special convertible security account 
subject to § 220.4(j). 
(4) The only other conditions to which transac-
tions in such special accounts shall be subject under 
the provisions of this part shall be such conditions 
as are specified in the appropriate paragraph of this 
section and in §§ 220.2, 220.6, 220.7, or 220.8, 
except insofar as § 220.3 applies to §§ 220.4(i), 
and (j). 
(b) Special omnibus account. In a special omni-
bus account, a member of a national securities ex-
change may effect and 
finance 
transactions for 
another member of a national securities exchange or 
a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under section 15 of the Se-
curities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o) 
from whom the member receives (1) written notice, 
pursuant to a rule of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission concerning the hypothecation of cus-
tomers' securities by brokers or dealers (Rule 8c-l 
(17 CFR 240.8c-1) or Rule 15c2-l 
(17 CFR 
240.15c2-l) ), to the effect that all securities car-
ried in the account will be carried for the account 
of the customers of the broker or dealer and (2) 
written notice that any short sales effected in the 
account will be short sales made in behalf of the 
customers of the broker or dealer other than his 
partners. No substitutions of collateral 
securing 
credit extended to a broker or dealer not described

October 6, 1969, and no such credit shall be main-
tained after July 8, 1970. 
(c) Special cash account. (1) In a special cash 
account, a creditor may effect for or with any cus-
tomer bona fide cash transactions in securities in 
which the creditor may: 
(1) Purchase any security for, or sell any security 
to, any customer, provided funds sufficient for the 
purpose are already held in the account or the pur-
chase or sale is in reliance upon an agreement ac-
cepted by the creditor in good faith that the cus-
tomer will promptly make full cash payment for the 
security and that the customer does not contemplate 
selling the security prior to making such payment. 
(ii) Sell any security for, or purchase any se-
curity from, any customer, provided the security is 
held in the account or the creditor is informed that 
the customer or his principal owns the security and 
the purchase or saie is in reliance upon an agree-
ment accepted by the creditor in good faith that the 
security is to be promptly deposited in the account. 
(2) 1 n case a customer purchases a security 
(other than an exempted security) in the special 
cash account and does not make full cash pay-
ment for the security within 7 days after the date 
on which the security is so purchased, the creditor 
shall, except as provided in subparagraphs ( 3 ) - ( 7 ) 
this paragraph, promptly cancel or otherwise 
liquidate the transaction or the unsettled portion 
thereof. 
x
 t- (3) If the security when so purchased is an un-
f i l e d security, the period applicable to the trans-
action under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
shall be 7 days after the date on which the security 
>s made available by the issuer for delivery to pur-
chasers. If the security when so purchased is a 
when distributed" security which is to be dis-
tributed in accordance with a published plan, the 
Period applicable to the transaction under sub-
Paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be 7 days 
®ftcr the date on which the security is so dis-
tributed. If the security when so purchased is a 
new security issued or to be issued for the purpose 
refunding outstanding securities which mature, 
°r are to be payable upon presentation for redemp-
t'on, within 35 days of the date on which the new 
security is nude available by the issuer for delivery 
t° purchasers, the period applicable to the trans-
action under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
shall be 7 days after such maturity or payment 
date: Provided, That this sentence shall apply only 
to the payment of that portion of the purchase price 
that docs not exceed 103 per cent of the amount 
that will be payable to the purchaser of the new 
security upon such maturity of, or payment for, 
securities owned by him at the time of the purchase. 
(4) If any shipment of securities is incidental 
to the consummation of the transaction, the period 
applicable to the transaction under subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph shall be deemed to be ex-
tended by the number of days required for all such 
shipments, but not by more than 7 days. 
(5) If the creditor, acting in good faith in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, 
purchases a security for a customer, or sells a se-
curity to a customer, with the understanding that 
he is to deliver the security promptly to the cus-
tomer, and the full cash payment to be made 
promptly by the customer is to be made against 
such delivery, the creditor may at his option treat 
the transaction as one to which the period appli-
cable under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is 
not the 7 days therein specified but 35 days after 
the date of such purchase or sale. 
(6) If an appropriate committee of a national 
securities exchange or a national securities associa-
tion is satisfied that the creditor is acting in good 
faith in making the application, that the application 
relates to a bona fide cash transaction, and that ex-
ceptional circumstances warrant such action, such 
committee, on application of the creditor, (i) may 
extend any period specified in subparagraphs (2), 
(3), (4), or (5) of this paragraph for one or more 
limited periods commensurate with the 
circum-
stances, or (ii), in case a security purchased by the 
customer in the special cash account is a margin or 
exempted security, may authorize the transfer of 
the transaction to a general account, special bond 
account, special convertible security account, or 
special omnibus account, and the completion of 
such transaction pursuant to the provisions of this 
part relating to such an account. 
(7) The 7-day periods specified in this para-
graph refer to 7 full business days. The 35-day 
period and the 90-day period specified in this para-
graph refer to calendar days, but if the last day of 
any such period is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, 
such period shall be considered to end on the next 
full business day. For the purposes of this para-
graph, a creditor may, at his option, disregard any 
sum due by the customer not exceeding $100. 
(8) Unless funds sufficient for the purpose are 
already in the account, no security other than an 
exempted security shall be purchased lor, or sold 
to, any customer in a special cash account with the

REGULATION T 
creditor if any security other than an exempted 
security has been purchased by such customer in 
such an account during the preceding 90 days, and 
then, for any reason whatever, without having been 
previously paid for in full by the customer, the 
security has been sold in the account or delivered 
out to any broker or dealer: Provided, 
That an 
appropriate committee of a national securities ex-
change or a national securities association, on ap-
plication of the creditor, may authorize the creditor 
to disregard for the purposes of this subparagraph 
any given instance of the type therein described if 
the committee is satisfied that both creditor and 
customer are acting in good faith and that circum-
stances warrant such authorization. For the pur-
poses of this subparagraph, the cancelation of a 
transaction, otherwise than to correct an error, shall 
he deemed to constitute a sale. The creditor may 
disregard for the purposes of this subparagraph a 
sale without prior payment provided full cash pay-
ment is received within the period described by sub-
Paragraph (2) of this paragraph and the customer 
has not withdrawn the proceeds of sale on or before 
the day on which such payment (and also final pay-
ment of any check received in that connection) is 
received. The creditor may so disregard a delivery 
of a security to another broker or dealer provided 
such delivery was for deposit into a special cash 
account which the latter broker or dealer maintains 
the same customer and in which account there 
are already sufficient funds to pay for the security 
so purchased; and for the purpose of determining in 
that connection the status of a customer's account 
at another broker or dealer, a creditor may rely upon 
a written statement which he accepts in good faith 
from such other broker or dealer. 
(d) Special 
arbitrage 
account. 
In 
a 
special 
Arbitrage account, a member of a national securities

means (1) a purchase or sale of a security in one 
Market together with an offsetting sale or purchase 
the same security in a different market at as 
nearly the same time as practicable, for the purpose 
taking advantage of a difference in prices in the 
! W 0 markets, or (2) a purchase of a security which 
,s» without restriction other than the payment of 
money, 
exchangeable 
or 
convertible 
within 
90 
calendar days following the date of its purchase 
into a second security together with an offsetting 
s°'le at or about the same time of such second 
security for the purpose of taking advantage of 
a disparity in the prices of the two securities. 
(e) Special commodity account. In a special 
commodity account, a creditor may effect and carry 
for any customer transactions in commodities.

member corporation, or the lender is a firm or cor-
poration which is a member of a national securities 
exchange and the borrower is a partner in such firm

(ii) Extend and maintain subordinated credit to 
another creditor for capital purposes: Provided, That 
(a) Either the lender or the borrower is a firm 
or corporation which is a member of a national 
securities exchange, the other party to the credit is 
an affiliated corporation of such member firm or 
corporation, and, in addition to the fact that an 
appropriate committee of the exchange is satisfied 
that the credit is not in contravention of any rule of 
the exchange, the credit has the approval of such 
committee, or 
(b) The lender as well as the borrower is a 
member of such exchange, the crcdit has the ap-
proval of an appropriate committee of the ex-
change, and the committee, in addition to being 
satisfied that the credit is not in contravention of 
any rule of the exchange, is satisfied that the crcdit 
is outside the ordinary course of the lender's busi-
ness. and that, if the borrower's firm or corporation 
or an affiliated corporation of such firm or corpora-
tion does any dealing in securities for its own 
account, the credit is not for the purpose of increas-
ing the amount of such dealing.

change as specialists. Such specialist's account shall 
be subject to the same conditions to which it would 
be subject if it were a general account except that if 
the specialist's exchange, in addition to the other 
requirements applicable to specialists, is designated 
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System as requiring reports suitable for supplying 
current information regarding specialists' use of 
crcdit pursuant to this paragraph, the requirements 
of § 220.6(b) 
regarding joint ventures shall not 
apply to such accounts and the maximum loan 
value of a registered security in such account shall 
be as determined by the creditor in good faith. 
(h) Special subscriptions accounts. In a special 
subscriptions account a creditor may effect and 
finance the acquisition of a margin security for a 
customer through the exercise of a right to acquire

drawal of cash or securities from the account so 
long as the remaining credit exceeds the maximum 
loan value of the remaining collateral in the ac-
count, except that when the remaining credit ex-
tended in connection with a given acquisition of 
securities in the account has become equal to or less 
than the maximum loan value of such securities as 
Prescribed in § 220.8 (the Supplement to Regula-

October 20, 1967, the requirements of subpara-
graph (2) of this section have been fulfilled), such 
securities shall be transferred to the ceneral account

count pursuant to § 220.4(j)) together with any 
remaining portion of such credit. In order to facili-

would be subject if it were a general account except 
that the maximum loan value of the securities in 
the account shall be as prescribed from time to time 
in § 220.8 (the Supplement to Regulation T). 
(3) Any security which ceases to be an equity 
security while held in this account shall continue to 
be treated as an equity security as long as it is 
continuously held in this account. 
(4) In the event any stock is to be substituted 
for a security held in this account, or if a security 
held in this account is to be used to offset a short 
sale in the general account, such security shall 
thereupon be transferred to the customer's general 
account against a deposit of cash or margin securi-
ties eligible for an extension of credit in this account 
(counted at their maximum loan value) equal to at 
least the maximum loan value of the security for 
which such substitution is made, without regard to 
the retention requirement of § 220.3(b)(2).

DETAILS

account, special bond account, or special con-
yertible security account is the account of a partner

justed debit balance of such account and the maxi-
mum loan value of the securities therein, shall dis-
c a r d 
the partner's financial relations with the 
I S < 
• 
§ 220.6 
firm as reflected in his capital and ordinary drawing 
accounts. 
(b) Contribution to joint venture. In case a 
general account, special bond account, or special 
convertible security account is the account of a 
joint venture in which the creditor participates, the 
adjusted debit balance of such account shall in-
clude, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
items 
specified 
in 
§ 220.3(d), any amount by which the creditor's 
contribution to the joint venture exceeds the con-
tribution which he would have made if he had con-
tributed merely in proportion to his right to share 
in the profits of the joint venture. 
(c) Guaranteed accounts. No guarantee of a 
customer's account shall be given any effect for 
purposes of this part. 
(d) Transfer of accounts. (1) In the event of 
the transfer of a general account, special bond ac-
count, or special convertible security account from 
one creditor to another, such account may be 
treated for the purposes of this part as if it had 
been maintained by the transferee from the date of 
its origin: Provided, That the transferee accepts in 
good faith a signed statement of the transferor that 
no cash or securities need be deposited in such 
account in connection with any transaction that has 
been effected in such account or, in case he finds 
that it is not practicable to obtain such a statement 
from the transferor, accepts in good faith such a 
signed statement from the customer. 
(2) I n the event of the transfer of a general 
account, special bond account, or special 
con-
vertible security account, from one customer to 
another, or to others, as a bona fide incident to a 
transaction that is not undertaken for the purpose 
of avoiding the requirements of this part, cach 
such transferee account may be treated by the 
creditor for the purposes of this part as if it had 
been maintained for the transferee from the date 
of its origin: Provided, That the creditor accepts in 
good faith and keeps with such transferee account 
a signed statement of the transferor describing the 
circumstances giving rise to the transfer. 
(e) Reorganizations. A creditor may, without 
regard to the other provisions of this part, effect 
for a customer the exchange of any margin or 
exempted security in a general account, special 
bond account, or special convertible security ac-
count, for the purpose of participating in a reor-
ganization or recapitalization in which the security 
is involved: Provided, 
That if a non-margin non-
exempted security is acquired 
in exchange 
the 
creditor shall not, for a period of 60 days following 
12 

§ 220.6 
1 8 G 8 
REGULATION T 
such acquisition, permit the withdrawal of such 
security or the proceeds of its sale from such ac-
count except to the extent that such security or 
proceeds could be withdrawn if the security were 
a margin security. 
(f) Time of receipt of funds or securities. For 
the purposes of this part, a creditor may, at his 
option (1) treat the receipt in good faith of any 
check or draft drawn on a bank which in the 
ordinary course of business is payable on presen-
tation, or any order on a savings bank with pass-
book attached which is so payable, as receipt of 
payment of the amount of such check, draft, or 
order; (2) treat the shipment of securities in good 
faith with sight draft attached as receipt of payment 
of the amount of such sight draft; and (3) in the 
case of the receipt in good faith of written or 
telegraphic notice in connection 
with a special 
omnibus account of a customer not located in the 
same city that a specified security or a check or 
draft has been dispatched to the creditor, treat the 
receipt of such notice as receipt of such security, 
check, or draft: Provided, 
however, 
That if the 
creditor receives notice that such check, draft, 
order, or sight draft described in subparagraphs 
(1), (2), or (3) of this paragraph is not paid on 
the day of presentation, or if such security, check, 
or draft described in subparagraph (3) 
of this 
Paragraph is not received by the creditor within a 
reasonable time, the creditor shall promptly take 
such action as he would have been required to take 
by the appropriate provisions of this part if the 
provisions of this paragraph had not been utilized. 
(g) Interest, scrvice charges, etc. (1) 
Interest 
°n credit maintained in a general account, special 
bond account, or special convertible security ac-
count, 
communication 
charges 
with 
respect 
to 
transactions in such account, 
shipping 
charges, 
premiums on securities borrowed 
in 
connection 
with short sales or to effect delivery, dividends or 
other distributions due en borrowed securities, and 
any 
service charges 
(other 
than 
commissions) 
which the creditor may impose, may be debited to 
such account in accordance with the usual prac-
tice and without regard to the other provisions of 
this part, but such items so debited shall be taken 
into consideration in calculating the net credit or 
net debit balance of such account. 
(2) A creditor may permit interest, dividends, 
or other distributions received by the creditor with 
respect to securities in a general account, special 
bond account, or special convertible security ac-
count, to be withdrawn from such account only on 
condition that the adjusted debit balance of such 
account does not exceed the maximum loan value 
of the securities in such account after such with-
drawal, or on condition that (i) such withdrawal 
is made within 35 days after the day on which, in 
accordance with the creditor's usual practice, such 
interest, dividends, or other distributions are en-
tered in such account, (ii) such entry in the ac-
count has not served in the meantime to permit in 
the account any transaction which could not other-
wise have been effected in accordance with this 
part, and (iii) any cash withdrawn does not repre-
sent any arrearage on the security with respect to 
which it was distributed, and the current market 
value of any securities withdrawn docs not exceed 
10 per cent of the current market value of the 
security with respect to which 
they were dis-
tributed. Failure by a creditor to obtain in a gen-
eral account, special bond account, or special con-
vertible security account, any cash or securities 
that are distributed with respect to any security in 
such account shall, except to the extent that with-
drawal would be permitted under the preceding 
sentence, be deemed to be a transaction in such 
account which occurs on the day on which the 
distribution 
is payable 
and which 
requites 
the 
creditor to obtain in accordance with § 220.3(b) a 
deposit of cash or securities having a maximum 
loan value at least as great as that of the dis-
tribution. 
(h) Borrowing and lending securities. Without 
regard to the other provisions of this part, a credi-
tor ( I ) may make a bona fide deposit of cash in 
order to borrow securities 
(whether margin 
or 
non-margin) for the purpose of making delivery of 
such securities in the case of short sales, failure to 
receive securities he is required to deliver, or other 
similar cases, and (2) may lend securities for such 
purpose against such a deposit. 
(i) Credit for clearance of securities. The ex-
tension or maintenance 
of any credit which is 
maintained for only a fraction of a day (that is, 
for only part of the time between the beginning of 
business and midnight on the same day) shall be 
disregarded for the purposes of this part, if it is 
incidental to the clearance of transactions in securi-
ties directly between members of a national securi-
ties exchange or through an agency organized or 
employed by such members for the purpose of 
elTecting such clearance. 
(j) Foreign currency. 
If foreign currency is 
capable of being converted without restriction into 
United States currency, a creditor acting in good 

REGULATION T § 220.3 ' 
1869 
§ 220.7 
faith may treat any such foreign currency in an 
account as a credit to the account in an amount 
determined in accordance with customary practicc. 
(k) Innoccnt mistakes. If any failure to comply 
with this part results from a mechanical mistake 
made in good faith in executing a transaction, 
recording, determining, or calculating any loan, 
balance, market price or loan value, or other simi-
lar mechanical mistake, the creditor shall not be 
deemed guilty of a violation of this part if promptly 
after the discovery of such mistake he takes what-
ever action may be practicable in the circumstances 
to remedy such mistake. 
SECTION 
220.7—MISCELLANEOUS 
PROVISIONS 
(a) Arranging for loans by others. A creditor 
n i ay arrange for the extension or maintenance of 
credit to or for any customer of such creditor by 
any person upon the same terms and conditions as 
'hose upon which the creditor, under the provisions 
this part, may himself extend or maintain such 
credit to such customer, but only upon such terms 
and conditions, except that this limitation shall not 
apply with respect to the arranging by a creditor 
f°r a bank subject to Part 221 of this Chapter 
(Regulation U) to extend or maintain credit on 
margin securities or exempted securities. 
(b) Maintenance of credit. Except as otherwise 
specifically forbidden by this part, any credit ini-
tially extended without violation of this part may be 
Maintained regardless of (1) reductions in the cus-
tomer's equity resulting from changes in market 
Prices, (2) the fact that any security in an account 
Ceases to be margin or exempted, and (3) 
any 
change in the maximum loan values or margin re-
quirements prescribed by the Board under this part. 
n maintaining any such credit, the creditor may 
a°cept or retain for his own protection additional 
codatcral of any description, including non-margin 
securities. 
(c) Statement of purpose of loan. Every exten-
sion of credit on a margin security (other than an 
exempted security) shall be deemed to be for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying or trading in 
securities, unless the creditor has accepted in good 
faith a written statement to the contrary in con-
formity with the requirements of Form F.R. T-4 
executed by the customer and executed and ac-
cepted in good faith by the creditor prior to such 
extension. The creditor shall retain such statement 
in his records for at least 3 years after such credit 
is extinguished. To accept the customer's statement 
in good faith, the creditor must (1) be alert to the 
circumstances surrounding the extension of credit 
and (2) if he has any information which would 
cause a prudent man not to accept the statement 
without inquiry, have investigated and be satisfied 
that the customer's statement is truthful. A creditor 
may rclv upon such a written statement if accepted 
in accordance with this paragraph. 
(d) Reports. Every creditor shall make such 
reports as the Board may require to enable the 
Board to perform the functions conferred upon it 
by the Act. 
(e) Additional requirements by exchanges and 
creditors. Nothing in this part shall (1) prevent 
any exchange or national securities association from 
adopting and enforcing any rule or regulation fur-
ther restricting the time or manner in whicn its 
members must obtain initial or additional margin in 
customer's accounts because of transactions effected 
in such accounts, or requiring such members to 
secure or maintain higher margins, or further re-
stricting the amount of credit which may be ex-
tended or maintained by them, or (2) modify or 
restrict the right of any creditor to require addi-
tional security for the maintenance of any credit, to 
refuse to extend credit, or to sell any securities or 
property held as collateral for any loan or credit 
extended by him.

chase, or (2) if the total cost of the purchase ex-
ceeds the proceeds of the sale, the credit may be in-
creased by an amount no greater than the maximum 
loan value of the stock purchased less the maximum 
loan value of the stock sold. If the maximum loan 
value of the collateral securing the credit has be-
come less than the amount of the credit, the amount

loan value at least equal to the amount of the 
increase.

stock-secured 
credit. In connection with an extension of credit 
secured directly or indirectly by any stock, the bank 
shall obtain and retain in its records for at least 3 
years after such credit is extinguished a statement 
m conformity with the requirements of Federal 
Reserve Form U-l 
executed by the recipient of 
such extension 0f credit (sometimes referred to as 
. "customer") and executed and accepted in good 
faith by a duly authorized officer of the bank prior 
to such extension: Provided, 
That this requirement 
" 
n o t apply to any credit described in para-
graphs (o) or (w) of this scction or § 221.2 of this 
Part except for credit described 
in 
paragraphs 
' • 2 ( 0 , (g), and (h) extended to persons who 
*re not brokers or dealers subject to Part 22.0 of 
ll»s 
Chapter 
(Regulation 
T). 
In 
determining 
nether or not an extension of credit is for the 
Purpose specified in § 221.1 or for any of the pur-
Poses specified in § 221.2 the bank may rely on the 
statement executed by the customer if accepted in 
£°°d faith. To accept the customer's statement in 
g°od faith, the officer must (1) be alert to the 
circumstances surrounding the credit and (2) if he 
as any information which would cause a prudent 
man not to accept the statement without inquiry, 
ave investigated and be satisfied that the customer's 
statement is truthful. 
Purpose of a crcdit. The "purpose of a 
credit' is determined 
by substance rather 
than 
form. 
( ! ) Credit which is for the purpose, whether 
•mediate, incidental, or ultimate, of purchasing or 
'"Vmg a margin stock is "purpose crcdit", despite 
any temporary application of funds otherwise. 
(2) Credit to enable the customer to reduce or 
retire indebtedness which was originally incurred to 
purchase a margin stock is for the purpose of 
"carrying" such a security. 
(3) An extension of credit provided for in a 
plan, program, or investment contract offered or 
sold or otherwise initiated after August 31, 1969, 
which provides for the acquisition both of any 
securities described in paragraph (v) of this section 
and of goods, services, property interests, other 
securities, or investments, is "purpose credit". 
(c) Indirectly 
sccured. 
The 
term 
"indirectly 
secured" includes any arrangement with the cus-
tomer under which the customer's right or ability 
to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of stock owned 
by the customer is in any way restricted so long as 
the credit remains outstanding, or under which the 
exercise of such right, whether by written agree-
ment or otherwise, is or may be cause for accelera-
tion of the maturity of the credit: Provided, 
That 
the foregoing shall not apply (1) if such restriction 
arises solely by virtue of an arrangement with the 
customer which pertains generally to the customer's 
assets unless a substantial part of such assets con-
sists of stock, or (2) if the bank in good faith has 
not relied upon such stock as collateral in the ex-
tension or maintenance of the particular credit: 
And provided further, 
That the foregoing shail not 
apply to stock held by the bank only in the capacity 
of custodian, depositary, or trustee, or under similar 
circumstances, if the bank in good faith has not 
relied upon such stock as collateral in the extension 
or maintenance of the particular credit. 
fd) OTC margin stock. (1) The term "OTC 
margin stock" means stock not traded on a national 
securities exchange which the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System has determined to 
have the degree of national investor interest, the 
depth and breadth of market, the availability of in-
formation respecting the stock and its issuer, and the 
character and permanence of the issuer to warrant 
subjecting such stock to the requirements of this 
part. 
(2) The Board will from time to time publish 
a list of OTC margin stocks as to which the 
Board has made the determination described in sub-
paragraph (1) of this paragraph (d). Except as 
provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph 
(d) such stocks shall meet the requirements of 
§ 221.4(d) (the Supplement to Regulation U). 
(3) The Board will from time to time remove 
from the list described in subparagraph (2) of this 
5 

REGULATION T § 220.3 ' 
1877 
§ 
2 2 1 . 3 
paragraph (d) stocks that cease to: 
(i) Exist or of which the issuer ceases to exist, 
or 
(ii) Meet substantially the provisions of sub-
paragraph 
(1) 
of 
this paragraph 
(d) 
and 
of 
§ 221.4(d) (The Supplement to Regulation U ) . 
(4) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Board 
may, upon its own initiative, or upon application by 
any interested party, omit or remove any stock that 
is not traded on a national securities exchange from 
or add any such stock to such list cf OTC margin 
stocks, if in the judgment of the Board, such action 
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest. 
(5) It shall be unlawful for any bank to make, 
or cause to be made, any representation to the 
effect that the inclusion of a security on such list of 
OTC margin stocks is evidence that the Board or 
the Securities and Exchange Commission has in any 
way passed upon the merits of, or given approval 
to, such security or any transaction therein. Any 
statement in an advertisement or other similar com-
munication containing a reference to the Board in 
connection with such stocks or such list shall 
constitute such an unlawful representation. 
(e) Renewals and extensions of maturity. The 
renewal or extension of maturity of a crcdit need 
not be treated as the extension of a credit if the 
amount, of the credit is not increased except by the 
addition of interest or service charges in respect to 
the credit or of taxes on transactions in connection 
with the credit. 
( 0 Transfers. A bank may, without following 
the requirements of this part as to the extension of 
a credit, 
(1) Permit the transfer of a credit from one 
customer to another, or to others: Provided, That a 
statement by the transferor, describing the circum-
stances giving rise to the transfer, is accepted in 
good faith 1 and signed by an officer of the bank as 
having been so accepted, and kept with each such 
transferee account, or 
(2) Accept the transfer of a credit originally 
extended in conformity with the requirements of 
t,Ms part directly from another bank: 
Provided, 
the statement of purpose, executed by the cus-
tomer in connection with the original extension of 
Cr<^it and accepted in good faith and signed by an 
ofhcer of the bank originally extending such credit 
! n conformity with the requirements of § 221.3(a), 
' s obtained and kept with each such transferee ac-
C o u r't: And 
provided 
jurtiier, 
That any transfer 
Pursuant to this paragraph is made as a bona fide 
' As described in § 2 2 1 . 3 ( a ) . 
incident to a transaction not undertaken for the 
purpose of avoiding the requirements of this part, 
the amount of the credit is not increased, and the 
collateral for the credit is not changed; and, after 
such transfer, a bank may permit such withdrawals 
and substitutions of collateral as are permitted in 
respect to a credit it extends subject to this part. 
(g) Reorganizations and recapitalizations. Noth-
ing in this part shall be construed to prevent a bank 
from permitting withdrawals or substitutions of 
securities to enable a customer to participate in a 
reorganization or recapitalization. 
(h) Mistakes in good faith. No mistake made 
in good faith in connection with the extension or 
maintenance of a crcdit shall be deemed to be a 
violation of this part. 
(i) Action for bank's o»n protection. Nothing 
in this part shall be construed as preventing a bank 
from taking such action as it shall deem necessary 
in good faith for its own protection. 
(j) Reports. Every bank, and every person en-
gaged in the business of extending credit who, in 
the ordinary course of business, extends credit for 
the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock 
shall make such reports as the Board of Governors

able it to perform the functions conferred upor. it 
by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78).

unless the context otherwise requires, the terms 
herein have the meanings assigned to them 
in 
section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 7Sc(a)), except that the term 
"bank" docs not include a bank which is a mem-
ber of a national securities exchange. 
(1) Stock. The term "stock" includes any secu-
rity commonly known as a stock; any voting trust 
certificate or other instrument representing such a 
security; and any security convertible, with or with-
out consideration, presently or in the future, into 
such security, certificate, or other instrument, or 
carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or 
purchase such a security; or any such warrant or 
right. 
(m) Credit subject to § 221.1. A "credit subject

tended for the purpose of purchasing or carrying 
any margin stock, and (3) not excepted by § 221.1 
( a ) ( 2 ) or § 221.2. 
(n) Segregation of collateral. (1) 
The 
bank

REGULATION 
U 
shall identify all the collateral used to meet the 
requirements of § 221.1 (the entire credit being 
considered a single credit and collateral being simi-
larly considered, as required by § 221.1(d)) 
and 
shall not cancel the identification of any portion 
thereof except in circumstances that would permit 
the withdrawal of that portion. Such identification 
may be made by any reasonable method. 
( 2 ) Only the collateral required to be so identi-
fied shall have loan value for purposes of § 221.1 
°r be subject to the restrictions therein specified 
with respcct to withdrawals and substitutions; and 
(3) I'or any credit extended to the same cus-
tomer that is not subject to § 221.1 (other than a 
credit described 
in 
§ 221.2(b), (d), (f), (g), or 
( h ) ) , the bank shall in good faith require as much 
collateral not so identified as the bank would re-
^ l u r e 
any) if it held neither the indebtedness 
s ^ j e c t to § 221.1 nor the identified collateral. This 
shall not be construed, however, to require 
the 
ank, after it has extended any credit, to obtain 
f n y collateral therefor because of any deficiency 
| n collateral already existing at the opening of 
business on June 15, 1959, or any decline in the 
V a'»e or quality of the collateral or in the credit 
rat'ng of the customer.

(p) Subscriptions 
issued 
to stockholders. 
An 
extension of credit need not comply with the other 
requirements of this part if it is to enable the 
customer to acquire a stock by exercising a right to 
acquire such stock which is evidenced by a warrant 
or certificate issued to stockholders and expiring 
within 90 days of issuance: Provided, 
That: 
(1) Each such acquisition under this paragraph 
shall be treated separately, and the credit when ex-
tended shall not exceed 75 per ccnt of the current 
market value of the stock so acquired as determined 
by any reasonable method: 
(2) After October 20, 1967, at the time credit 
is extended pursuant to this paragraph, the bank 
shali compute the amount by which the credit ex-
ceeds the maximum loan value of the collateral 
as prescribed by 5 221.4 and the customer shall re-
duce the credit by an amount at least equal to 
one-fourth of such sum by the end of each of the 4 
succeeding 3-caIendar-month periods or until the 
credit docs not exceed the current maximum loan 
value of the stock, whichever shall occur first, and 
if the bank fails to obtain the required quarterly 
reduction or a portion thereof with respect to a 
particular acquisition within 5 full business days 
after such reduction is due. the bank shall promptly 
sell a portion of the collateral so acquired and apply 
the proceeds of the sale to reduce the credit in an 
amount at least equal to twice the required pay-
ment or portion thereof for the first 2 such reduc-
tions, at least equal to the required payment or por-
tion thereof for the third such reduction, and at least 
sufficient so that the remaining crcdit does 
not 
exceed the current maximum loan value of the re-
maining collateral after the fourth such reduction: 
Provided, 
That no such reduction need be in an 
amount greater than is necessary so that the re-
maining credit does not exceed the maximum loan 
value of the remaining collateral determined as of 
the date when the credit was extended; 
(3) While the customer has any crcdit outstand-
ing at the bank under this paragraph no withdrawal 
of cash or substitution or withdrawal of stock used 
as collateral for such extension of credit shall be

, ng of such stocks. Any credit extended to any such 
customer, unless the credit is so separated and dis-
associated or is excepted by § 221.2, is a credit

or (ii) earning a warrant or right to subscribe to or 
purchase such a stock (such a debt security is 
sometimes referred to herein as a "convertible secu-
rity"). 
(2) Credit extended under this paragrapli shall 
be subject to the same conditions as if it were sub-
ject to § 221.1 except: (i) the entire amount of such 
credit shall be considered a single credit treated 
separately from the single credit specified in § 221.1 
(d) and all the collateral securing such credit shall 
be considered in determining whether or not the 
credit complies with this part, and (ii) the maxi-
mum loan value of the collateral shall be as pre-
scribed from time to time in § 221.4 (the Supple-
ment to Regulation U ) . 
(3) Any convertible security originally eligible 
as collateral for a credit extended under this para-
graph shall be treated as such as long as continu-
ously h:ld as collateral for such credit even though 
it ceases to be convertible or to carry warrants or 
rights. 
(4) In the event that any stock other than a 
convertible security is substituted for a convertible 
security held as collateral for a credit extended 
under this paragraph, the stock and any credit ex-
tended on it in compliance with this part shall 
thereupon be treated as subject to § 221.1 and the 
credit extended under this paragraph shall be re-
duced by an amount equal to the maximum loan 
value of the security withdrawn.

Item No. 3 
6/2/69 
For immediate release. 
June 2, 1969. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
announced amendments to its margin Regulations G, T, and U which 
would limit the credit available in connection with the purchase of 
equity funding plans or programs. 
The Board set the margin require-
ment for such plans or programs sold after August 31, 1969, at 60 
per cent. The margin requirement for exchange-lis ted stocks is pre-
sently 80 per cent. 
Proposed changes in the regulations were first published 
for comment on December 10, 1968. An oral presentation was held 
before the Board on February 26, 1969, at which interested parties 
were invited to present their views. 
Equity funding plans offer a customer a package of mutual 
fund shares and life insurance, the shares being pledged as collateral 
for a loan to pay the insurance premium. After August 31, a lender 
will be able to finance $40 in insurance premiums for every $100 in 
Mutual funds bought by a customer. 
The text of the amendments is attached.

minor changes in the information contained in the original report 
form approved by the SRAC. These three reports together will 
represent a major first step toward meeting System requirements 
for information on Euro-dollar and other activities of the foreign 
branches. 
The maturity schedule of F.R. 501 will provide data that 
will be helpful in assessing the current and prospective money market 
pressures on the foreign branches and on the Euro-dollar market. 
The 
significance of these pressures for domestic policy purposes is under-
lined by the fact that at present outstanding liabilities of member 
banks to their foreign branches are substantially larger than the 
outstanding large negotiable CD's of those banks with foreign branches. 
In order to assure correct reporting on report forms 
F.R. 501, 502, and 503, it would be advisable if they were filed with 
the Division of your Bank that collects information on Treasury IET 
Form 3954 and/or the Treasury Foreign Exchange Forms B-l, B-2, and 
B-3. The Treasury has agreed to drop the reporting requirement on 
its Form 3954 for any branches that report on either F.R. 502 or 
F.R. 503.

A technical memorandum providing more detailed instructions 
for processing these reports will be forwarded to your Bank as soon 
as it is available. 
Please advise Mr. Bender of the name of the 
person at your Bank who will handle processing of the reports. 
Although the report form covers the foreign branches of 
member banks, it would be highly desirable to have reports filed 
voluntarily by any nonmember bank with foreign branches on the same 
basis as that for member banks. 
Nonmember banks that currently report 
on Treasury Form 3954 will, of course, be authorized by the Treasury 
to discontinue such reporting only if they report on forms F.R. 502 
or F.R. 503. 
But for purposes of monetary analysis, it would be 
advantageous to have those nonmember banks with branches file reports 
on F.R. 501 as well.
