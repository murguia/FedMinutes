North Shore Capital Corporation. 
In a memorandum dated July 28, 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended denial of 
the application of North Shore Capital Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
to become a bank holding company through the acquisition of shares of 
The North Shore National Bank of Chicago. 
During discussion a question was raised whether it would be 
useful to negotiate with the applicant in an effort to improve the 
capital position of North Shore National Bank. 
However, there was 

2079 
8/8/72 
-5-
support for the view that once ari application was before the Board, a 
Positive position should be taken with respect to that application. 
The Board then unanimously denied the application and authorized 
the issuance of an order reflecting that decision. 
A copy of the order 
is attached as Item N o . 11. 
Texas Commerce Bancshares. 
By order dated April 11, 1972, the 
Board denied the application of Texas Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Houston, 
Texas, to acquire shares of the successor by merger to The American 
National Bank of Beaumont, Beaumont, Texas. 
At the same time the Board 
denied this application, it approved another by the applicant to acquire 
shares of Beaumont State Bank, Beaumont, Texas. 
On May 9, 1972, Texas Commerce submitted a request for 
reconsideration of its American National application. 
This request 
Was granted by the Board on June 13. 
In granting the request, the 
Board found that information contained in the original application 
failed to inform the Board that the proposed acquisition of shares of 
Beaumont State was contingent upon, and sought only in connection w i t h , 
> 
the acquisition of American National. 
In the absence of this informa-
tion, the Board had treated the separate application to acquire shares 
of Beaumont State as a transaction independent from the acquisition of 
American National. 
In a memorandum dated August 1, 1972, the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation outlined several developments that had taken place 

2080 
8/8/72 
-6-
subsequent to the Board's April 11, 1972, actions that weighed in favor 
of approving the American National application. 
The Division stated 
that while the acquisition of American National by Texas Commerce would 
have some anticompetitive aspects, the net effect would be only slightly 
adverse and would be outweighed by the increased viability that new 
aggressive management would bring to American National. 
However, 
American National owned shares of Beaumont State, and in order to create 
an additional banking alternative in the relevant market area, staff 
recommended that approval of the application be conditioned upon Texas 
Commerce divesting itself of any interest in Beaumont State. 
After a brief discussion, the Board unanimously approved the 
application, conditioned upon Texas Commerce divesting itself of any 
interest in Beaumont State. 
It was understood that implementing documents 
Would be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Texas Commerce Bancshares. 
Texas Commerce Bancshares, Inc., 
Houston, Texas, had made application to the Board to acquire shares of 
the successors by merger to (1) Reagan State Bank of Houston, and (2) 
Airline Bank, both in Houston, Texas. 
In a memorandum dated August 1, 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended denial of 
the Reagan State application and approval of the Airline Bank applica-
tion, conditioned upon Texas Commerce divesting its interest in Reagan 
State. 
In a memorandum dated July 31, 1972, the Banking Markets Section 
recommended approval of both applications. 

208; 
8/8/72 
-7-
During discussion Governors Robertson and Brimmer expressed 
the view that the acquisition of the two banks would further strengthen 
the applicant's dominant position in the Houston market; would eliminate 
Potential competition; and would eliminate a vehicle for entry into the 
Houston market by a new or different bank holding company. 
In their 
judgment, acquisition of Airline Bank only would not have these unde-
sirable effects. 
Accordingly, they favored denial of the application 
to acquire Reagan State Bank and approval of the Airline Bank acquisi-
tion, conditioned upon divestiture by applicant of its holdings in 
Reagan State Bank. 
Other members of the Board indicated their intention 
to approve both applications. 
The two applications were then approved, Governors Robertson 
and Brimmer dissenting. 
It was understood that an order reflecting 
that decision would be prepared for the Board's consideration, and that 
a dissenting statement would also be prepared. 
Report on financial developments. 
The Board authorized, subject 
to certain changes, the transmittal of a staff report to the Joint 
Economic Committee on financial developments in the second quarter of 
1972. 
A copy of the letter transmitting the report is attached as 
Item No. 12; a copy of the report, as transmitted, has been placed in 
the Board's files. 
Hunt Commission Report. 
On May 30, 1972, the Department of the 
Treasury asked that the Board comment on several recommendations made 

2082 
8/8/72 
-8-
by the President's Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation. 
With a memorandum dated August 7, 1972, the Board's Task Force on the 
Hunt Commission Report presented for consideration a draft letter in 
reply to the Treasury Department's request. 
Following discussion during which several changes in the letter 
Were suggested, it was agreed that staff would revise the letter in 
light of comments made today and that a committee composed of Governors 
Mitchell, Brimmer, and Bucher would review the revised draft prior to 
its consideration by the Board. 
All members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland, Melnicoff, 
Smith, Gramley, and Pierce withdrew from the meeting at this point and 
the following entered: 
Mr. Kakalec, Controller; Messrs. Slocum, 
director, and Hampton, Associate Director, Division of Data Processing; 
and Mr. Henry, Assistant Adviser, Division of International Finance. 
Evaluation of data processing functions. 
Governor Sheehan asked 
for the Board's approval to conduct an evaluation of the Board's data 
Processing functions using a consultant firm supplemented with an 
individual consultant at a cost of approximately $100,000, as presented 
in his memorandum of August 4, 1972. 
The question was raised as to how much benefit would be gained 
from having an outside expert or group of experts appraise the Board's 
data processing needs. 
It was pointed out that it would be possible to 

2083 
8/8/72 
-9-
evaluate the ways in which research activities used data processing 
Without questioning the desirability of research projects. 
Chairman Burns withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
It was agreed that a proposal would be developed to provide for 
evaluation of the operational side of the Board's data processing 
functions by a consulting firm and that bids would be obtained from 
several firms, which would then be submitted for Board consideration. 
At the same time the staff was instructed to begin the preparation of 
a proposal for a consulting group to conduct a review of the user side 
°f the Board's data processing functions. 
Governor Brimmer did not favor either action because he believed 
that a survey group working on an evaluation of the operational side 
w°uld interfere with the necessary data processing work and that an 
evaluation of the user side would not answer the basic question. 
Officer appointment. 
Pursuant to the recommendation in a 
memorandum from Governor Sheehan dated August 1, 1972, the Board approved 
the appointment of Edward K . O'Connor as Assistant Director, Division of 
Data Processing, effective on the date of this action. 
Mr. O'Connor's 
salary would remain the same as at present but would be reviewed along 
with all other official staff salaries at the end of the year. 
The meeting then adjourned.

STATEMENT BY 
BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
REGARDING APPLICATIONS BY 
FIRST UNION, INCORPORATED, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, 
ACTIONS ON ACQUISITION OF BANKS 
Nature of transaction. - First Union, Incorporated, St. Louis, 
Missouri, a registered bank holding company, has applied to the Board 
°
f Governors, pursuant to § 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act 
U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of 90 
P e r cent or more of the voting shares of The Peoples Bank and Trust 
C o®pany of Branson, Branson, Missouri ("Branson Bank"), The Bank of 
Crane, Crane, Missouri ("Crane Bank"), and The Bank of Taney County, 
P o r s y t h , Missouri ("Forsyth Bank"). 
While each of the applications has been separately considered 
atlcl the proposed acquisition of Forsyth Bank is subject to a separate 
s°ard Order, because of certain common facts and circumstances this 
Statement contains the Board's findings and conclusions with respect 
t*« 
L ° all of the applications. 
Statutory considerations. - Applicant, the third largest 
kank holding company and banking organization in Missouri, controls 
banks with aggregate deposits of $1,048.7 million, representing 
^Proximately 8.3 per cent of the commercial bank deposits in the State, 
banking data are as of December 31, 1971, adjusted to reflect 
holding company acquisitions and formations approved by the Board 
trough June 30, 1972.) As a result of consummation of the three 
Pr°poQed acquisitions herein, Applicant's share of Statewide deposits 
W°
uld increase by 0.3 percentage points, and its position in relation 

2 0 8 3 
-2-
t o the State's other bank holding companies and banking organizations 
w°uld remain unchanged. 
Branson Bank ($16.5 million in deposits) and Forsyth Bank 
($8.9 million in deposits) are the largest and third largest, respect-
ably, of three banks competing in the Taney County banking market, 
a n d control a combined share of 62.7 per cent of total deposits in 
that market. The present degree of common ownership between the two 
kanks, while significant, is not as conclusive as would be the case 
uPon affiliation with Applicant. The proposed affiliation would place 
th 
e two banks under common control, which would tend to have a signifi-
C a n t impact on concentration in Taney County. Furthermore, acquisition 
o f both Branson Bank and Forsyth Bank would eliminate a banking alter-
ative since the banks in Branson are the closest alternatives for 
t e sidents of Forsyth. Approval would also foreclose potential compe-
t i t :ion as the operations of Branson Bank and Forsyth Bank are expected 
t o b e drawn much closer together by the planned establishment of remote 
a cilities for each Bank at Hollister and Rockaway Beach, respectively. 
Co 
^P letion of such facilities, under Missouri's new bank facility law, 
V°
uXd substantially increase the likelihood of meaningful competition 
^ e l o p i n g between them in the future. 
Crane Bank ($8.5 million in deposits) is the largest of two 
at*ks i n stone County, the adjacent county to Taney County, Acquisi-
iot 
ti 
0 t l of Crane Bank and Branson Bank would have no anticompetitive 
sequences as the two banks are 35 miles apart, serve separate counties 

-3-
2089 
which constitute separate banking markets, and have an intervening 
bank between them. Potential competition would not be adversely 
affected. 
No existing competition with Applicant's subsidiary banks 
Would be eliminated, as Applicant's closest subsidiary bank is located 
i n Springfield, Missouri, about 30 miles from Crane Bank and 40 miles 
from Branson Bank. 
On the basis of the record before it, the Board concludes 
that the competitive effects of the proposed acquisitions, with the 
e*ception of Forsyth Bank, are consistent with approval of the 
aPPlications. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
°f Applicant, its subsidiary banks, and Banks, are regarded as satis-
factory, in view of Applicant's commitment to provide $350,000 in 
a d<Htional capital to Branson Bank and its agreement to permit Branson 
°ank to retain all earnings for a period of three years. 
Affiliation with Applicant will permit higher loan limits 
through loan participation arrangements, and allow each of the 
c°ffimunities involved to be afforded trust and investment management 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of 
^ e communities to be served lend weight for approval. With the 
e*ception 
of the Forsyth Bank proposal, any anticompetitive consc-
iences inherent in the proposed acquisitions are clearly outweighed 
ky the probable effect of the transactions in meeting the convenience 
needs of the communities to be served. The likely adverse 

-4 
2080 
c°ropetitive consequences that would attend the Forsyth Bank acquisition 
a r e not outweighed by benefits to the community to be served. 
Conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts before it, 
tlle Board concludes that the proposed acquisitions of Branson Bank 
a n d Crane Bank would be in the public interest and these applications 
should be approved. The proposed acquisition of Forsyth Bank would not 
in the public interest and that application should be denied.

New Jersey National Corporation 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
New Jersey National Corporation, Trenton, New Jersey, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
!842(a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' 
qualify i n g shares) of New Jersey National Bank of Princeton, Princeton 
Borough, New Jersey ("New Bank"), a proposed new bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for inter-
e s fpj 
persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance 
W.th <j 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has ex-
pired, and none has been timely received. The Board has considered the 
application in the light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
( l 2 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls one bank, New Jersey National Bank, Princeton 
( Bank"), with deposits of $578.7 million, representing 3.4 per cent of 
e aggregate commercial bank deposits for the State of New Jersey. 
(All 
banking data are as of December 31, 1971, and reflect holding company 
formations and acquisitions approved by the Board through May 31, 1972.) 
^ank holds the largest percentage of deposits in the Second New Jersey 
inking District and also in the Trenton Banking Market, but is the 
S G c o n d largest New Jersey banking organization represented in this mar-
ket area. The acquisition by Applicant of the proposed new bank would 
£ 
a n v areas. 
^ave no immediate impact on the concentration of banking resources in 

2032 
-2-
The proposed location of New Bank would be in Princeton 
B°
r o uSh, a distance of 8.3 miles from the nearest office of Bank. 
l s Prohibited by State law from branching into this area where 
s uksidiaries of two banking organizations, with $1.1 billion and 
6 / / 
» 
million in deposits, respectively, presently operate six 
o ffice G. Branch offices of three Trenton market banks are also 
located i n the outlying area. The establishment of New Bank in 
n ceton Borough would not adversely affect competition in any 
L e v a n t areas, but, conversely, would have a procompetitive effect 
t y p r o v i d i n g another source of full banking services to the Princeton 
Bor 
0 u g h area. Competitive considerations are consistent with approval 
0 f the application. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant and 
Bani 
c are considered to be generally satisfactory and their prospects 
aPpear favorable. New Bank would also appear to have favorable pros-
P G C t s 
f o r future development and growth. Banking factors are consis-
t G n t with approval of the application. Although the major banking 
Heed" c 
ot the Trenton market are presently fulfilled by its 25 banking 
rSanizations, New Bank would provide alternative banking facilities 
t0 «»n 
area of 27,500 inhabitants which area appears to have good 
t ential for growth and economic expansion. Considerations relating 
to 
u convenience and needs of the communities to be served are con-
ent with and lend some support toward approval of the application.

Item No. 3 
8/8/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FIRST BANC GROUP OF OHIO, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First Banc Group of Ohio, Inc., Columbus, Ohio, a bank 
hold ing company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, 
has applied for the Board's approval under section 3(a)(3) of the 
A c t (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire the successor by merger to 
The First National Bank and Trust Company of Ravenna, Ravenna, 
Ohio ("Bank"). The bank into which Bank is to be merged has no 
significance except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of 
v°ting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition is 
treated herein as the proposed acquisition of the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given 
accordance with section 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing 
comments and views has expired and the Board has considered the 
aPPlication, and all comments received in light of the factors 
S e t forth in section 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls 12 banks with deposits of about $847 
m l U i o n representing approximately 3.6 per cent of total deposits 
o f commercial banks in Ohio, and is the seventh largest banking 
1/ 
°
rganization in the State. 
Acquisition of Bank (deposits of

Banking data are as of December 31, 1971, and reflect holding 
company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board through 
J une 30, 1972. Data also reflect the Board's approval of this 
d a t e of Applicant's acquisition of The Liberty National Bank of 
F reemont, Freemont, Ohio.

about $57 million) would increase Applicant's share of deposits in 
the State by only 0.2 percentage points and would not alter its 
State ranking nor result in a significant increase in the concen-
tration of banking resources in Ohio. 
Bank is the seventh largest organization operating in the 
Akron banking market and has only 3.9 per cent of market deposits. 
There is no substantial existing competition between Applicant and 
Bank, and there is little probability of competition developing in 
the future because of the distances separating Bank and Applicant's 
banking subsidiaries and Ohio branching laws. On the other hand, 
the entry by Applicant into the Akron market through a "foothold" 
acquisition such as that of Bank may enable Bank to provide increased 
competition for the larger organizations in the market. The Board 
concludes that competitive considerations are consistent with 
approval of the application. 
Considerations relating to the financial condition, 
managerial resources and prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary 
banks, and Bank are generally satisfactory. Applicant proposes 
to provide Bank with additional management depth so that banking 
considerations give weight for approval of the application. Con-
siderations relating to the convenience and needs of the community 
to be served lend weight for approval of the application since 
Applicant plans to provide educational loans and automatic 24 
hour teller service which Bank does not presently provide for its 
customers. It is the Board's judgment that consummation 
of the 

2036 
-2-
P
roposed acquisition would be in the public interest and the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consum-
m ated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective 
date of this Order or (b) later than three months after the effec-
date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good

Item No. 11 
8/8/72 
NORTH SHORE CAPITAL CORPORATION 
Order Denying Formation of Bank Holding Company 
North Shore Capital Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
h a s applied for the Board's approval under 5 3(a)(1) of the 
Bar*k Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation 
of a bank holding company through acquisition of 50.1 per cent 
OY* 
wore of the voting shares of The North Shore National Bank 
o f Chicago, Chicago, Illinois ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
in* 
tested persons to submit comments and views, has been given 
i a accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing com-
m G a t s 
a n d views has expired, and the Board has considered the 
aPPlication and all comments received in light of the factors 
8 e t forth in 5 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant is a newly-formed organization and has no 
derating history. Upon acquisition of Bank ($102.2 million 
f deposits), Applicant would control 0.3 per cent of the com-
mercial bank deposits in Illinois. 
(All banking data are as of 
U t l e 30, 1971.) Bank is the fourth largest of 18 banks competing 
in 1*. 
service area and holds approximately S per cent of area 
^Posits. The Board notes that the principals of Applicant are 
Principals of four other one-bank holding companies in 
I l l i r*oi 8, which hold deposits of $51, $38, $22, and $7 million, 
e sPectively. However, consummation of the proposed transaction 

2107 
-2-
i s n o t likely to adversely affect existing competition in that the 
service areas of the other banks controlled by these principals do 
n o t appear to overlap with that of Bank, The nearest of these, 
Citizen's National Bank of Chicago, is approximately 12 miles 
distant from Bank. 
Applicant will incur substantial debt in order to acquire 
shares of Bank and has projected retirement of this debt in 8-1/2 
y ears from dividends to be declared by Bank. Although, on occasion, 
e Board has approved acquisitions involving similar or even 
heater relative amounts of debt, payable over a lengthier period, 
fch 
°
se cases involved the transfer of ownership of small rural banks 
generally through the formation of small one-bank holding companies. 
Itv 
each such case, the adverse effects deriving from leverage were 
°utweighed by public benefits deriving from the facilitation of the 
o therwise-difficult taslc of transferring ownership of those banks 
a a d the promotion of local ownership and management. Those benefits 
e absent where, as here, the bank, whose shares are sought to be 
acciuired, is a large bank located in an urban center. The amount 
f debt Applicant will assume and the length of time contemplated 
to 
r etire that debt are considered excessive for the financing 
of _ , 
a bank of this size. 
Although Bank's asset condition is satisfactory, an 
itlf 
uaion of capital is necessary to raise Bank's capital to what 
th 
e Board deems to be an acceptable level. The Board generally 

2 1 0 8 
-2-
expects a bank holding company to assist its subsidiary banks 
especially where those banks are in need of increased capitaliza-
tion. However, Applicant, apparently due to the debt-servicing 
obligations it would incur upon consummation of the proposed 
transaction, has been unreceptive to suggestions that it increase 
Bank' s capital. The fact that Bank's earnings have been below 
the average earnings of similarly-sized banks suggests that con-
summation would foreclose capital improvement in Bank, and that 
Applicant may even be unable to service its debt without unduly 
straining Bank's earnings, retention of which are necessary to 
strengthen Bank's capital position. 
Applicant's projected income includes an annual "consulting" 
fee of $24,000 to be extracted from Bank in order to enable Applic-
a a t to service its acquisition debt. In return, directors and 
officers of Applicant would, as directors and officers of Bank, 
Provide services to Bank normally provided by such bank management; 
applicant will not have a servicing staff. This consulting fee 
therefore appears to be unjustified and a means by which a portion 
Bank's income would be distributed to Applicant without a 
similar pro rata distribution to Bank's minority stockholders. 
The instant proposal contemplates the use of excessive 
leverage and, if consummated, could impede Bank's future capital 
growth and unduly operate to the detriment of Bank's minority 
s hareholders. These factors weigh heavily against approval of this 
Application. 

-4-
2109 
The convenience and needs of the communities to be 
served are already adequately being served and there is no 
evidence that consummation of the proposed acquisition would 
give rise to any significant public benefits, other than those 
derived from the added flexibility inherent in a holding company 
structure. Considerations relating to the convenience and needs 
the communities to be served therefore lend slight weight for 
approval. 
Under all the circumstances of this case, the Board 
includes that the leverage contemplated, the potentially unful-
filled capital need of Bank and unfair treatment of minority 
shareholders involved in this proposal present adverse circumstances 
hearing on the financial condition, managerial resources, and future 
Prospects of Applicant and Bank. These circumstances are not 
°utweighed by any procompetitive factors or by considerations 
r eiating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be * 
served. Accordingly, approval of this application is not in the 
Public interest and it should be denied. 
On the basis of the record, the application is denied 
f°r the reasons summarized above. 
By order of the Board of Governors,-^ effective August 0, 1972.
