Minutes of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
on Wednesday, July 8, 1970. The Board met in the Board Room at 3:50 p.m.

Mr. Kenyon, Deputy Secretary 
Mr. Hackley, Assistant to the Board 
Mr. Solomon, Director, Division of

Parsons Group banks. Governor Robertson reported that a request 
had been made of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on behalf of 
Birmingham-Bloomfield Bank, a nonmember bank in Birmingham, Michigan, 
for a conduit loan through Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit. The loan 
would be in the amount of $20,000,000 and would be secured by municipals 
having a par value of around $26,000,000 and a market value of about 
$19,000,000. 
It was stated that if the loan was not available this 
afternoon, the Birmingham bank would not be able to meet its cash 
letters. The Reserve Bank had believed that Board approval would be 
necessary, but it had been ascertained that that was not true, for 
sufficient authorization was contained in outstanding Board letters to 
the Reserve Banks to permit this kind of action in an emergency situa-
tion. Accordingly, he would call the Chicago Reserve Bank and supply 
them with references to the outstanding letters. He would also advise 
the Reserve Bank, however, that in his opinion the contemplated loan, 
if made, should be for short duration, perhaps for a period such as 
seven days.
