Data processing. Governor Mitchell reported that he and 
Governor Sherrill had discussed with representatives of the Data 
Processing and Research Divisions problems relating to the processing 
of projects emanating from the research area and that it appeared pro-
gress was being made. Governor Brimmer noted that the reorganization 
of the Division of Data Processing had been approved almost a year ago 
and suggested it would seem desirable for the Board at some point to 
reassess, in a systematic fashion, the developments since that time. 
Governor Mitchell indicated that he saw no objection but suggested 
that such reassessment await the return of the Director of the Division 
of Research and Statistics. 
Annex building. Mr. Shepardson noted that questions had been 
raised by Board members at the meeting with the architects on July 27 
concerning the amount of office and other space in the present Federal 
Reserve Building as compared with the proposed annex building, and also 
concerning the population of the respective buildings. He distributed 
arid commented upon information that had been compiled in those regards. 
Mr. Shepardson also distributed and commented on data that had 
been compiled with regard to the private dining room, cafeteria, and 
kitchen areas in the present building as compared with space that would 
available in the annex building if the Board should adopt a plan 
whereby such facilities would be transferred to the terrace floor of 
that building.

There followed a general discussion of alternatives, with mixed 
views expressed by members of the Board. A compromise was then pro-
posed under which private dining room, cafeteria, and kitchen facilities 
would be provided on the terrace floor of the annex building, with the 
Library moved to a lower floor of that building, but the private dining 
rooms in the present building would be retained for the use of Board 
members and guests, along with such service facilities as might be 
needed for that purpose. General agreement was reached on such a plan. 
It was understood that the architects would be requested to study the 
preliminary layout of the terrace floor further in light of today's 
decision and certain suggestions for rearrangement of the facilities 
on that floor that were made during today's discussion. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Board of Directors, 
Marine Midland Trust Company of 
Western New York, 
Buffalo, New York. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System approves the establishment by Marine Midland Trust 
Company of Western New York, Buffalo, New York, of a 
branch (public accommodation office) approximately 337 
feet east of an existing branch at 3051 Sheridan Drive, 
Town of Amherst, Erie County, New York, provided the 
branch is established within one year from the date of 
this letter. 
It is the Board's understanding that the most 
recent examination of your bank indicates your bank's 
capital position to be less than satisfactory and that 
plans are to increase the capital funds of the bank this 
fall. The Board urges that all available steps be taken 
to improve the bank's liquidity and capital positions. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L. Carmichael 
Elizabeth L. Carmichael, 
Assistant Secretary.

Dear Mr. Swan: 
The Board of Governors concurs in the action of the 
Conference of Presidents at its meeting on July 18, 1967, 
approving, the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Accounting 
on telephone requests by member banks for transfer of funds. 
The report of the Subcommittee on Accounting dated 
May 17, 1967, noted that all Reserve Banks accept telephone 
requests but generally have not formally recognized them in 
operating instructions. The committee recommended, therefore, 
that all Federal Reserve Banks instruct their member banks that 
requests for transfer of funds may be made by telephone as well 
as by telegraph and mail. The committee recommended also that 
protective measures with respect to telephone requests be left 
to the discretion of the Reserve Banks. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
