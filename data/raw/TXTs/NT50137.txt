In connection with Item No. 2, Governor Brimmer noted that the 
letter included a paragraph stating the basis for approval. 
Inclusion 
of such a statement was in line with instructions sent to the Federal 
Reserve Banks in the Board's letter dated August 10, 1967, in connection 
with actions on branch applications under delegated authority. 
Governor 
Brimmer made clear that he had no objection; he was simply calling the 
innovation to the Board's attention. 
Application of Virginia Commonwealth. 
Virginia Commonwealth 
Bankshares, Inc., (formerly Virginia Commonwealth Corporation), Richmond, 
Virginia, had applied for permission to acquire more than 50 per cent of 
the voting shares of American National Bank, Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
As indicated in documentation distributed to the Board under date of 

3507 
9/6/67 
-3-
August 11, 1967, favorable action on the application was recommended by 
the Examination Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, by 
the Banking Markets Section, and by the Division of Examinations. 
Denial 
was recommended by the Research Department of the Reserve Bank. 
The application was complicated by the fact that in June 1966 
applicant's Richmond subsidiary (Bank of Virginia) entered into an agree-
ment with Farmers & Merchants State Bank of Fredericksburg in order to 
make its credit card program available to the Fredericksburg area. Under 
the agreement Farmers & Merchants State Bank offered Charge Plan services 
through dealers in the Fredericksburg area, and holders of the cards also 
could obtain loans from Bank of Virginia through the Fredericksburg bank 
in amounts ranging from $50 to $500 under a plan known as Charge-A-Loan. 
Question was raised within the Richmond Reserve Bank as to the legality 
of the agreement under the provisions of Federal and State law with 
regard to branch operations, and a memorandum had been prepared by the 
Bank's Legal Department. 
In a memorandum of August 30, 1967, the Board's Legal Division 
discussed (1) whether the credit card program, as presently operated 
and proposed to be operated, constituted a branch operation, and (2) 
whether such present and proposed operation contravened the antitrust 
laws. The Legal Division concluded that Farmers & Merchants State Bank 
rather clearly would not constitute a branch of Bank of Virginia so far 
as the Charge Plan operation was concerned. 
It also concluded that, 

3508 
9/6/67 
-4-
while the question might be more debatable, operations involving the 
Charge-A-Loan service did not constitute Farmers & Merchants State 
Bank a "branch place of business" within the meaning of the applicable 
Federal statute. It was believed that Virginia law was sufficiently 
different from Federal law that any differing views at the State and 
Federal levels probably could be easily reconciled. The Legal Division 
was of the opinion that Bank of Virginia's proposed affiliation with 
American National Bank (whether the relationship between Bank of Virginia 
and Farmers & Merchants State Bank continued or was terminated) did not 
present anticompetitive considerations sufficient to warrant denial of 
the pending application. 
In the discussion at this meeting Governor Mitchell called atten-
tion to the memorandum from the Research Department in which Vice Presi-
dent Ratchford stated that he found it difficult to accept applicant's 
contention that none of its present subsidiaries competed in American 
National Bank's primary service area. Mr. Ratchford believed that Bank 
Â°f Virginia was a significant competitive factor in the Fredericksburg 
a^ea. if the application was approved, he thought it reasonable to 
assume that Bank of Virginia would cease to compete with another sub-
sidiary of the holding company. Thus one competitor would be eliminated, 
and that would have an adverse effect on competition. 
In reply to a question by Governor Mitchell, Mr. Shull said the 
Banking Markets Section did not share the view that Bank of Virginia was 

3509 
9/6/67 
-5-
a significant competitive factor in the Fredericksburg area. Loans by 
Bank of Virginia in the area (about $2.5 million) were thought to over-
state the bank's competitive role because about 95 per cent of the total 
was accounted for by a single customer relationship of long standing. 
The only other significant loan business of Bank of Virginia in the area 
resulted from the Charge Plan relationship with Farmers & Merchants State 
Bank. At midyear 1967, balances outstanding amounted to $144,000. The 
Banking Markets Section recognized the anticompetitive possibility stem-
ming from the fact that Virginia Commonwealth would have a subsidiary 
bank in Fredericksburg and also offered its credit card service through 
the largest bank in that city. The anticompetitive effect could be sub-
stantial if the relationships resulted in the elimination of competition 
between those two banks for other types of services. However, the effect 
on over-all competition was problematical. 
Governor Brimmer commented that he had anticipated discussion 
at this meeting of the role of the credit card plan in a broader con-
text, since the implications went far beyond this particular case. He 
was disappointed that the Reserve Bank had not gotten in touch with the 
System Task Group on Bank Credit Cards, for the analysis by the Reserve 
Bank reflected a lack of understanding of the credit card movement and 
how such plans operated. 
In his opinion the Board should be cautious 
about accepting the views put forward by the Research Department of the 
Reserve Bank, and to some extent by the Legal Department. While the 

' > CT i f\ 
9/6/67 
-6-
credit card operation might in the longer run have implications such as 
the Banking Markets Section had suggested, the opinion of the Board's 
Legal Division that branch banking was not involved should be accepted. 
Asked by Governor Daane whether he agreed that the credit card 
operation should not preclude approval of the pending application, Gov-
ernor Brimmer said he felt that the credit card issue was extraneous. 
The use of credit cards had implications going well beyond this one case 
and the Board should take another look at the broader problem when the 
report of the Task Group was available, but the pending application 
should be considered on a straightforward basis, without reference to 
the credit card issue. 
Governor Mitchell noted that the Board, in its reports on com-
petitive factors, frequently referred to potential competition as an 
important consideration. American National Bank, a relatively new bank 
with a good growth record, would appear to have the potential to con-
tinue to compete without affiliation with the holding company. The 
argument had been made that it would be a better competitor if so affil-
iated, but the community would lose one competitive element if it was 
true that Bank of Virginia was already competing significantly in the 
area. According to the documentation, Bank of Virginia was at least 
competing in the community for consumer credit. 
Mr. Leavitt replied that in a situation of this kind there was 
always some potential for increased competition. However, he did not 

3511 
9/6/67 
-7-
think that in this instance any significant amount of potential competi-
tion would be eliminated if the application were approved. 
Governor Mitchell then asked the legal staff how much weight it 
would envisage putting on the banking factors in writing a statement in 
support of approval of the application. 
Mr. O'Connell replied that approval of the application would 
resolve a management problem at American National Bank resulting prin-
cipally from the resignation of the bank's president. The prospective 
strengthening of management would therefore presumably be mentioned in 
the statement. As to the elimination of potential competition, while 
the Legal Division did not feel that that factor should preclude approval 
of the application, it could not be ignored. Therefore, it would be 
necessary to cite some factor such as strengthening of management to 
substantiate approval. He would personally be inclined to give little 
weight to the convenience and needs factor. 
Governor Brimmer agreed that the basic needs of the community 
apparently were not going unmet. However, it did not appear to him that 
they were being met in the most efficient manner. American National 
Bank's loan limit of $50,000 served to preclude it from meeting many of 
the credit demands likely to arise in the area. 
Governor Robertson observed that the same statement could be 
made with respect to almost every small bank just starting operations. 
In the past two years, he noted, American National Bank had grown at a 
more rapid pace than the other two local banks. 

1 ><.> Â« At-/ 
9/6/67 
-8-
Governor Brimmer then commented that neither of the other two 
local banks, with deposits of around $20 million each, offered floor 
plan financing or certain other services. 
In terms of convenience and 
needs, the community might not be in as bad a shape as some others, but 
it did not have a wealth of banking services available. The convenience 
and needs factor seemed to be at least consistent with approval of the 
application, and he would have thought that it offered some slight 
weight in favor of approval. 
Mr. O'Connell noted that the Board's statements had frequently 
conceded that the basic needs of the area concerned were being met, with 
discussion following in terms of the added convenience that would be 
afforded by consummation of the proposal in question. 
In this case the 
fact that consummation of the proposal could contribute something in 
terms of convenience added slight weight toward approval, even though 
the basic needs of the community were being met. 
The Board members then stated their views, beginning with Governor 
Mitchell, who said that he would approve the application mainly on the 
grounds of the banking factors, with minimal consideration given to the 
convenience and needs factor. 
Governor Daane said that he would approve, not only because of 
the banking factors but also because he believed the convenience and 
needs of the community would be better served. This view was bolstered 
by his personal knowledge of the area and of the banks and bankers 

9/6/67 
-9-
involved. While the factor of potential competition could not be 
ignored, affiliation of American National Bank with the holding company 
would, in his view, enhance the competitive drive of that bank and cause 
the other banks also to become more competitive. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he would approve. He felt that 
the management factor was important and that there would be a slight 
benefit in terms of convenience and needs. 
Governor Brimmer then referred to a letter from the Chairman of 
the Board of American National Bank dated September 2, 1967, stating 
that the uncertainty produced by the pendency of the application had 
had adverse effects on the bank which, taken together, were such as to 
hamper its continued satisfactory operation. The hope was expressed 
that the Board would act on the application quickly. Governor Brimmer 
inquired why it had taken so long to process the application, and Mr. 
Lyon replied that part of the delay had resulted from the special study 
made by the Richmond Reserve Bank of the questions that had arisen con-
cerning the credit card operation. Governor Brimmer expressed disappoint-
ment that the Reserve Bank had not gotten in touch with the System Task 
Group, for that might have expedited the matter. 
Governor Sherrill said that he would approve the application. 
Governor Robertson expressed concern about the growing domina-
tion of the banking structure of the State by holding companies. How-
ever, he did not feel that the adverse aspects of this particular case 

3514. 
9/6/67 
-10-
were sufficiently clear to warrant denial, and therefore he would 
approve. 
Chairman Martin also said that he would approve. 
Accordingly, the application was approved unanimously, with the 
understanding that an order and statement would be drafted for the 
Board's consideration. 
Presidential reorganization plan (Item No. 4). By letter dated 
August 15, 1967, the Bureau of the Budget had renewed its annual request 
to Government agencies for recommendations with respect to organizational 
changes that might be accomplished through Presidential reorganization 
plan. 
A memorandum from the Legal Division dated September 1, 1967, 
recalled that the Board had customarily responded by indicating that it 
"has no such recommendations to make at this time." As previously indi-
cated to the Board, however, the Legal Division believed that the Presi-
dent was authorized to transmit to the Congress a reorganization plan 
affecting the Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. Under the 
law, any such plan would become effective 60 days after submission 
(assuming Congress was in session) unless either House of the Congress 
Passed a resolution against it. 
The memorandum went on to point out that a reorganization plan 
involving the transfer of certain of the Board's functions to another 
agency would seem particularly appropriate if it would eliminate over-
lapping and duplication of effort. Such a plan might, for example, 

3515 
9/6/67 
-11-
transfer to the Securities and Exchange Commission those functions of 
the Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation relating to public disclosure of information with 
respect to bank stocks. That would be in accord with views expressed 
by the Board in connection with the debate on the legislation that 
vested such authority in the bank supervisory agencies. Another example 
would be a plan designed to unify bank supervision in a Federal banking 
commission. The question, therefore, was whether the Board would want 
to have its staff develop an outline of any particular reorganization 
plan before October 1, 1967, the deadline set by the Budget Bureau for 
submission of proposals. 
In discussion Governor Robertson expressed the view that it 
might well be appropriate to propose transferring to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission the functions vested in the bank supervisory agencies 
relating to public disclosure of information with regard to bank stocks. 
Governor Brimmer suggested, however, that the submission of such 
a proposal might only serve to open up broader questions of reorganiza-
tion. Perhaps, therefore, it would be advisable not to propose the 
transfer of a function unless the issue was regarded as vital. 
Governor 
Daane expressed a similar view. 
As to unified Federal bank supervision, Governor Robertson com-
mented that it probably would be preferable if others were to suggest 
a reorganization plan and the Board's views were then requested. 

351G 
9/6/67 
-12-
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that there might be reason 
to take the initiative if that problem was certain to be looked at in 
isolation. However, he was not convinced that that would be the case. 
Governor Daane expressed doubt that the Board itself could agree 
on what recommendation for reorganization should be made in the bank 
supervisory area. 
Governor Sherrill said it was his position that the present 
structure of bank supervision was adequate except that the examining 
function could be reorganized into two separate phases: 
information 
gathering and application of supervision. He thought that the first 
phase could be centralized. However, any recommendations made in this 
area were certain to provoke disagreements, and he doubted whether the 
submission of a proposal for reorganization would be advisable. 
After further discussion it was agreed unanimously to send the 
usual reply to the Budget Bureau. A copy of the letter sent is attached 
as Item No. 4. 
Changes in method of computing interest on savings accounts 
(Items 5-7). There had been received by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation a copy of a letter from a depositor of Bank of the Common-
wealth, Detroit, Michigan, to the president of that bank, expressing 
dissatisfaction because the bank had changed its method of computing 
interest on his savings account without notifying him in advance. The 
correspondence had been referred by the Corporation to the Board because 

9/6/67 
-13-
the bank was a member of the Federal Reserve System. In his letter 
the depositor (Mr. George F. Zak) also made a number of specific sug-
gestions that he felt should be included in the "rules" governing bank 
activities in connection with the payment of interest on savings deposits. 
The letter had been distributed to the Board with a memorandum 
from the Legal Division dated September 1, 1967. Submitted with the 
memorandum was a draft of letter to Mr. Zak in which reference would be 
made to the letter sent by the several Federal supervisory agencies to 
banks and savings and loan associations in December 1966 with respect 
to advertising practices in attracting funds. The draft noted that a 
bank that followed the principles and spirit of that letter would, at 
least in its advertising for funds, furnish a portion of the information 
that Mr. Zak believed should be made available to depositors. The draft 
would state, however, that there was a substantial question whether under 
present law the Board of Governors was authorized to promulgate require-
ments such as had been suggested. 
Also submitted with the memorandum was a proposed letter to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago indicating that the Board would 
appreciate the Reserve Bank's looking into the matter with a view to 
verifying the statements made by Mr. Zak, ascertaining what steps, if 
any, Bank of the Commonwealth had taken, and suggesting to the Board 
any action considered appropriate in the circumstances. The letter to 
the Reserve Bank would also state that in the Board's view it was gen-
erally undesirable for a member bank to change its method of computing 

851.8 
9/6/67 
-14-
interest on savings accounts without adequate advance notice to depos-
itors . 
In discussion Governor Mitchell suggested that the December 
1966 letter on advertising practices might be expanded to include some 
of the suggestions made by Mr. Zak. 
Governor Robertson agreed and added that in any event the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago should be asked to investigate the circumstances 
of the particular case. 
Governor Brimmer referred to the portion of the proposed letter 
to the Reserve Bank expressing the view that it was generally undesir-
able for a member bank to change its method of computing interest on 
i 
savings accounts without adequate advance notice to depositors. 
If 
that was the Board's view, he suggested including the statement in the 
letter to Mr. Zak. 
Mr. Hexter commented that among the thousands of banks in the 
country the practice referred to by the correspondent probably was not 
uncommon. This suggested to him that the Board's approach should be to 
probe in general rather than to single out a particular bank for crit-
icism. 
Governor Robertson replied that it was his view that it was 
undesirable for a member bank to change its method of computing interest 
on savings accounts without adequate advance notice to depositors. He 
hoped that that statement would be included in the letter to Mr. Zak 

9/6/67 
-15-
and that a copy of the letter would be sent to Bank of the Commonwealth. 
He agreed with Mr. Hexter that any policy statement should be directed 
to all banks. But he saw no reason why the Board should not make its 
view known. 
Governor Mitchell observed that any change in the December 1966 
letter would have to be cleared through the Coordinating Committee on 
Bank Regulation. 
After further discussion unanimous approval was given to the 
sending of a letter to Mr. Zak in the form attached as Item No. 5 and 
to the transmittal to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago of a letter 
in a form attached as Item No. 6. With the letter to the Reserve Bank 
was enclosed a copy of the Board's letter to the depositor that the 
Reserve Bank could transmit to Bank of the Commonwealth. 
Secretary's Note: The depositor's sugges-
tions were discussed at the meeting of the 
Coordinating Committee on September 7, at 
which time it was agreed that the Commit-
tee would give further consideration to 
the matter. Attached as Item No. 7 is a 
copy of a letter sent to the Federal Re-
serve Banks on September 12 requesting 
their views on possible expansion of the 
December 1966 letter on advertising prac-
tices . 
The meeting then adjourned.

September 6, 1967 
Mr. George F. Zak, 
16706 Philomene, 
Allen Park, Michigan. 
48101 
Dear Mr. Zak: 
This refers to your undated letter to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation enclosing a letter of May 5, 1967, to 
Mr. George Miller, President of the Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit, 
Michigan. By letter of August 9, 1967, the FDIC referred your cor-
respondence to this agency, since the Bank of the Commonwealth is a 
member of the Federal Reserve System. 
You indicate that, before the Bank of the Commonwealth 
acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the Public Bank, 
the latter paid you interest on your savings account from the date 
of deposit to the date of withdrawal. You further indicate that 
Bank of the Commonwealth paid you interest on that basis for the 
calendar quarter in which your account was taken over by that bank, 
but that with respect to the immediately following quarter, without 
notice to you, interest was credited on a basis less favorable to 
you. You acknowledge that the bank was probably within its legal 
rights in making the change but suggest that legislative or regulatory 
measures should be taken to require banks to take certain actions 
directed toward fully informing depositors of their practices with 
respect to the payment of interest on deposits - such as notifying 
depositors in advance of a change in the method of computing interest. 
In December 1966, the Board of Governors and the other 
Federal agencies that have supervisory responsibilities with respect 
to commercial banks and savings and loan associations sent to the 
executive officer of each of the institutions supervised by them a 
uniform letter that was directed against certain advertising practices 
that had been used by certain institutions seeking to attract funds. 
A copy of the Board's letter is enclosed for your information. 
A bank that follows the principles and spirit of that 
letter would, at least in its advertising for funds, furnish a portion 
of the informati on that you believe should be available to depositors. 
For example, in following principle (1) the bank would advertise its 
interest rate in terms of simple interest per annum. 

Mr. George F. Zak 
-2-
Requiring banks to follow your suggestions would certainly 
help depositors to understand a bank's method of computing interest. 
A beneficial consequence of this would be that an investor could 
then readily ascertain the advantages of depositing funds in one bank 
as compared with another. However, there is a substantial question 
whether under present law the Board of Governors is authorized to 
promulgate requirements such as you suggest. The Congress could, of 
course, confer such authority on the Board or any other Federal agency 
or include in the Federal statutes those requirements that it considers 
appropriate. 
(Incidentally, the so-called "Truth in Lending"legislative 
Proposal that is currently under consideration by the Congress would 
not authorize the Board to impose such requirements. That legislation 
is directed at fair disclosure in connection with extensions of credit, 
rfuch as lending by financial institutions, rather than conditions 
surrounding solicitation and receipt of deposits and payment of interest 
thereon.) 
The Board has requested the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
to investigate the circumstances surrounding the particular complaint 
mentioned in your letter. For your information, in making such 
request the Board expressed the view that it is generally undesirable 
for a member bank to change its method of computing interest on 
savings accounts without adequate advance notice to its depositors. 
Very truly yours, 
1J

Dear Mr. Scanlon: 
Enclosed is a copy of the Board's letter of today's date 
to Mr. George F. Zak of Allen Park, Michigan, together with a copy 
of his letter of May 5, 1967, to Mr. George Miller, President of 
the Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit, Michigan. Both letters relate 
to giving of notice with respect to a bank's "rules" governing pay-
ment of interest on deposits and significant changes therein. 
The Board would appreciate your looking into the circumstances 
surrounding the particular complaint mentioned in Mr. Zak's letter 
with a view toward (1) verifying the factual statements therein, 
(2) ascertaining what, if anything, Mr. Miller or the Bank has done 
in response to such letter, (3) suggesting to the Board any action 
that you consider appropriate. In making your investigation you 
may be guided by the Board's view that it is generally undesirable 
for a member bank to change its method of computing interest on 
savings accounts without adequate advance notice to its depositors. 
An additional copy of the Board's letter to Mr. Zak is 
enclosed with the thought that you will wish to make it available 
to the Bank of the Commonwealth. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
