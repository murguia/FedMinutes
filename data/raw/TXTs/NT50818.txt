Consent calendar. The application of Chase Manhattan Overseas 
Banking Corporation, New York, New York, to continue holding shares of 
Chase Manhattan Trust Corporation Limited, Nassau, Bahamas, after the

latter's purchase of up to 43 per cent of the capital stock of Standard 
Bank Limited, Jersey, Channel Islands, United Kingdom, had been placed 
on the consent calendar. However, in view of several questions that 
were raised, consideration of the application was deferred. 
The Board approved unanimously a letter (copy attached as 
Item No. 1) to Continental International Finance Corporation, Chicago, 
Illinois, granting consent to the acquisition of shares of a financial 
company to be formed in Toronto, Canada, and to continue to hold those 
shares after the company completes specified transactions. 
The Board approved unanimously the transmittal to the Comptroller 
of the Currency of a report on the competitive factors involved in the 
proposed purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of Bank of 
Redding, Redding, California, by The Bank of California, National Associa 
tion, San Francisco. The conclusion read as follows: 
There is no competition existing between Bank of 
Redding and The Bank of California, National Association, 
San Francisco; however, there is potential for the 
development of competition between them through the 
establishment of de_ novo branches. The overall 
competitive effect of the proposed transaction would 
be slightly adverse. 
The Board approved unanimously the application of Mercantile 
Bancorporation Inc., St. Louis, Missouri, to acquire shares of Mercantile 
Bank and Trust Company, Kansas City, Missouri, and authorized issuance 
of an order reflecting this decision, with the understanding that cer-
tain editorial changes would be made in the order. A copy of the order, 
as issued, is attached as Item No. 2.

The Board approved unanimously the application of Northern 
Michigan Corporation, Escanaba, Michigan, to become a bank holding 
company through acquisition of shares of Northern Michigan National 
Bank, also of Escanaba, and authorized issuance of an order (copy 
attached as Item No. 3) reflecting this decision,, 
Allied Bank International„ 
Subject to certain editorial 
changes, approval was given to a letter to Allied Bank International, 
New York, New York, denying its application for permission to amend 
its articles of association and to issue stock to Cleveland Trust 
Company, Cleveland, Ohio, Governor Mitchell dissenting. A copy of the 
letter in the form in which it was transmitted is attached as Item No0 4„ 
Proposed issuance of capital notes. There had been distributed 
a memorandum dated August 27, 1971, from the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation recommending approval of an application by The Cortland Sav-
ings and Banking Company, Cortland, Ohio, for permission to issue capital 
notes. 
i 
Governor Robertson noted that this bank had no real need for 
more capital, and apparently the application resulted from instructions 
by the State Superintendent of Banks for injection of additional capital,, 
He suggested that the Board approve the application, but direct a letter 
to the State Superintendent calling attention to the undesirability of 
such type of issuance in the present circumstances. However, Governor 
Mitchell suggested that the Board not send a letter at this time since 

2263 
9/2/71

guidelines in this area were being developed by the Interagency Coor-
dinating Committee on Bank Regulation0 
A letter to the bank (copy attached as Item No. 5) granting 
permission to issue capital notes was thereupon approved unanimously, 
and it was agreed that no comment would be made to the State banking 
authority. 
Reserves against real estate loans. With a memorandum dated 
August 20, 1971, the Division of Research and Statistics submitted 
three alternative draft replies to a request from the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget for the Board's views on S0 2018, a bill to allow banks 
to accumulate bad debt reserves against real estate loans in a manner 
ii 
•> 
similar to that permitted mutual savings banks and savings and loan 
associations. 
Discussion indicated that some Board members favored the draft 
letter that expressed the Board's opposition to the bill, having in mind 
especially the large tax savings that it would provide banks, which 
would amount to a hidden subsidy for real estate loans. Others preferred 
the draft letter stating that the Board had no objection to the proposed 
legislation,, During the discussion it also was suggested that the staff 
memorandum be transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget, subject 
to certain revisions., 
After further consideration of the draft letters and the 
randum, approval was given to the transmittal of the letter opposing 
memo-

the bill, along with a revised explanatory memorandum, Governors Mitchell 
and Sherrill dissenting. Copies of the letter and memorandum, as trans-
mitted, are attached under Item No. 6. 
Treasury tax proposals. In reply to a request from the Office 
of Management and Budget for the Board's views on three tax proposals 
that the Treasury Department proposed submitting to the Congress, a 
draft letter had been prepared stating that the Board had no objection 
to the proposals. However, discussion brought out that the Board 
actually had little information on the proposals and, accordingly, there 
were reservations about sending a letter indicating that the Board had 
no objection. It therefore was agreed that the letter would be revised 
to state that the Board had no comments on the proposals at this time. 
A copy of the letter in the form in which it was transmitted is attached 
as Item No. 7. 
360-day year in computing interest. At its meeting on August 31, 
1971, the Board considered a draft reply to a request from Chairman 
Patman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency regarding the pro-
priety of the use of the 360-day year by banks in computing interest on 
loans. As a result of discussion, the staff was asked to prepare a draft 
letter that would incorporate a more detailed response to the questions 
raised by Chairman Patman. 
After a brief discussion the Board approved unanimously the 
transmittal of the detailed draft letter, subject to certain changes.

A copy of the letter, as transmitted, is attached as Item No. 8. 
Delegation of authority. In a memorandum dated August 18, 
1971, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended an amend-
ment to section 265.2(c) of the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of 
Authority. The amendment would delegate authority to the Director of 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation to approve repayments of the 
"deficiency" on stock option loans in lesser amounts and over longer 
periods of time than those specified in Regulation G. 
The Board unanimously approved the recommendation. A copy of 
the notice submitted to the Federal Register is attached as Item No. 9. 
Amendments to Retirement and Thrift Plans. in a memorandum of 
August 13, 1971, which included pertinent attachments, the Committee on 
Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans recommended approval of a 
number of amendments to the Retirement and Thrift Plans for Employees of 
the Federal Reserve System and their related trust and by-laws documents, 
subject to a favorable determination by the Internal Revenue Service 
as to the continued qualification of the Plans under sections 401(a) and 
501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Following comments by Governor Maisel, the recommended amendments 
were approved, Governor Mitchell abstaining. Attached as Item No. 10 
is a copy of the letter that was sent to Mr. Heflin as Chairman of the 
Board of Trustees of the Retirement Plan and as Chairman of the Adminis-
trative Committee of the Thrift Plan.

Retirement allowance agreement. In a memorandum dated August 24, 
1971, the Division of Personnel Administration recommended approval of 
a proposed supplemental retirement allowance agreement between the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the recently appointed President 
Winn. The proposed agreement conformed to the conditions set forth in 
the Board's letter of June 11, 1970, addressed to all Federal Reserve 
Bank Cha irmen, but contained deviations from the standard text that 
(1) took into account recent changes in the Retirement Plan for Employees 
of the Federal Reserve System and (2) defined "final average salary" in 
terms of the Retirement Plan as it exists at the time of retirement 
rather than as it exists under the Rules and Regulations of the Retire-
ment System effective January 1, 1970. The Cleveland Bank also asked 
the Board to consider modification of the agreement to provide a sur-
vivorship option compatible with that available under the Retirement 
Plan. 
The Division recommended approval of the agreement as submitted, 
but recommended against the suggested modification of the agreement 
with respect to a survivorship option, since it was felt that this might 
threaten the tax-exempt status of the Retirement Plan under section 401 
of the Internal Revenue Code. A draft letter to the Cleveland Bank 
reflecting these recommendations was attached to the memorandum.

After discussion, the letter and agreement were approved 
unanimously (copies attached under Item No. 11). It was also agreed 
that the changes in this agreement could also be incorporated into the 
supplemental retirement allowance agreement between the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago and President Mayo. A copy of the letter transmitted 
to the Chicago Bank is attached as Item No. 12. 
During discussion there was reference to the problems experienced 
in attracting qualified persons to Reserve Bank presidencies and the 
importance of fringe benefits, especially during the retirement years. 
With this in mind, the staff was asked to explore possible ways of 
improving retirement benefits for Reserve Bank presidents.

company ("Financial Company") to be formed in Toronto, Canada, at a 
cost of approximately Can.$549,000, and to continue to hold the shares 
of Financial Company after Financial Company (1) acquires all of the 
shares of a mortgage company ("Mortgage Company") to be formed in 
Toronto, Canada, at a cost of approximately Can. $100, and (2.) issues 
obligations, with maturities in excess of one year but not to exceed 
20 years, up to Can.$100,000,000, provided the shares of Financial 
Company and Mortgage Company are acquired within one year from the 
date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of Financial Company by CIFC is granted subject to the 
following conditions: 
(1) That CIFC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in Financial Company if Financial 
Company at any time fails to restrict its activities 
to those permissible to a corporation in which a 
corporation organized under Section 25(a) of the 
Federal Reserve Act could, with the consent of the 
Board of Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if 
Financial Company establishes any branch or agency 
or takes any action or undertakes any operation in 
Canada or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to CIFC;

That, when required by the Board of Governors, CIFC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of Financial Company as it may re-
quire from time to time; and 
That any share acquisitions or dispositions by

tion 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as 
they relate to restrictions on loans granted by Financial Company

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governorsr pursuant to 
section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1342(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by Mercantile Bancorporation Inc., 
St. Louis, Missouri, for the Board's prior approval of the acquisi-
tion of up to 100 per cent of the voting shares of Mercantile Bank 
and Trust Company ("Bank"), Kansas City, Missouri. 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
written notice of receipt of the application to the Missouri Commissioner 
°f Finance, and requested his views and recommendation. The Commissioner 
found the proposed action to be a very progressive step in banking.

Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on July 9, 1971 (36 Federal Register 12930), pro-
viding an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
views with respect to the proposal, A copy of the application was 
forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its consid-
eration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and all those 
received have been considered. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
and managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant and 
the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served, and finds that: 
Applicant controls three banks with aggregate deposits of 
$1,093.7 million, representing 9.5 per cent of total deposits in 
Missouri, (All banking data are as of December 31, 1970, and reflect 
holding company formations and acquisitions approved through July 31, 
1971.) Bank ($63.6 million deposits) is the eighth largest banking 
organization in the Kansas City area with 2.1 per cent of area deposits. 
Affiliation with Applicant should enhance Bank's ability to compete 
with the larger organizations in the area, the three largest of which 
lead batiks 
tff ffiu!ti*batik holding tdmpaHies each of wMtft has (baffle 
subsidiaries in the St. Louis area served by Applicant's lead bank. 
Competition for business accounts Should be stimulated fry Applicant's

laws and the considerable distance between Bank and Applicant's three 
subsidiaries, the closest of which is located 180 miles from Bank, it 
does not appear that existing competition would be eliminated, or signi-
ficant potential competition foreclosed, by consummation of Applicant's 
proposal. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its 
subsidiaries, and Bank are satisfactory and, therefore, consistent with 
approval. The future prospects of Bank would be enhanced by consumma-
tion of this proposal, and this factor weighs in favor of approval. 
Applicant plans to initiate or expand various services for the busi-
ness customer, such as International banking'services, data processing, 
and leasing. Accordingly, considerations relating to the convenience 
and needs of the community to be served lend some weight for approval. 
It is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in 
the public interest and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered. For the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisi-
tion so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth cal-
endar day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months 
after the date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good 
cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of St, Louis pur-
suant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, September 2, 1971. 
Voting for this action: Vice Chairman Robertson and Governors 
Mitchell, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill.

Escanaba, Michigan, for the Board's prior approval of action whereby 
Applicant would become a bank holding company through the acquisition 
of 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of Northern Michigan 
National Bank ("Bank"), Escanaba, Michigan.

recommended approval of the application.

in the character of the banking facilities involved, consummation of 
the proposal would not alter existing banking competition nor significantly 
affect potential competition. The financial and managerial resources and 
prospects of Applicant and Bank are generally satisfactory and consistent 
with approval of the application. The convenience and needs of the 
communities involved will not be immediately affected by consummation of 
this proposal, but improved services may be provided in the future under 
the more flexible corporate structure of the holding company system. 
It is the Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the public 
interest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered, For the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisition 
so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months 
after the date of this Order, unless such period is extended for good 
cause by the Board or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 
pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, September 2, 1971.

Gentlemen: 
This is in reply to your letter of January 20, 1971, 
requesting approval of amendments of your Articles of Association 
in order to permit Cleveland Trust Company ("CTC"), Cleveland, 
Ohio, to become a shareholder in your Corporation ("ABI"). 
The Board continues to view ABI as a vehicle to enable 
small- and medium-sized banks with underdeveloped international 
banking capabilities to cooperate in the development of a wide range 
of international banking facilities. This concept formed the basis 
for the Board's decision to authorize the establishment of ABI. 
To insure that participation in ABI does not have a detrimental 
effect on existing or potential competition, the Board has scruti-
nized all applications for membership in Alii in order to make 
certain that this original concept is maintained and that a bank 
seeking to join ABI does not have the resources and customers to 
warrant the development of significant independent international 
banking services. 
In considering this request, the Board noted that CTC is 
the largest bank in Ohio and is also one of the largest banks in 
the country. CTC has sufficient resources to establish independent 
international banking facilities. Moreover, it is located in a 
market area which supports a large volume of international business 
and provides CTC with sufficient actual or potential customers to 
justify the development of extensive international banking services. 

2 2 7 V 
Allied Bank International 
-2-
Therefore, after careful consideration of the application, 
the Board concluded-that CTC's affiliation with AB1 would not bo 
consistent with its original concept of ABI and would have an adverse 
effect on potential competition. Consequently, authorization of the 
proposed amendment is denied. 
Very truly yours, 
I

ADDRESS OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE 
TO THE BOARD 
September 7, 1971 
Mr. C. William Fischer 
Assistant Director for 
Legislative Reference 
Executive Office of the President 
Office of Management and Budget 
Washington, D.C. 
20503 
Dear Mr. Fischer: 
This letter is in response to your request for the Board's 
view on S. 2018, a bill that would allow banks to set aside bad debt 
reserves on real property loans in a manner similar to that permitted 
mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations. Since its 
introduction, Senator Brock has recognized that S. 2018 is technically 
deficient and has introduced S. 2055 to replace it. Our comments, 
consequently, are directed at the provisions in this latter bill. A 
bill also has been introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 9113), 
incidentally, that is exactly the same as S. 2055. 
The board is opposed to this proposed legislation. The 
change in tax rules would, by increasing the volume of balances that can 
be credited to bad debt reserves on real estate loans, provide banks 
with a large tax savings. This amounts to paying banks a subsidy for 
making real estate loans, and, while the flow of funds into the mortgage 
market would be increased as a result, this would not appear to be a 
desirable way to promote.this development. 
This evaluation is based on two considerations. First, as 
presently written, the bill would allow banks to build up reserves 
against their existing portfolio of real estate loans as well as against 
additional increments to the portfolio. Our calculations suggest, for 
example, that, if the rule were to be applicable for the tax year ending 
December 31, 1971, commercial bank bad debt reserves could be increased 
by as much as $590 million and their tax liabilities reduced by an 
amount in excess of $250 million, even if their real estate loan port-
folios remained at their end of 1970 level. Since justification for 
this legislation must be based mainly on the grounds of promoting the 
flow of additional funds into the mortgage market, allowing these 
credits against the existing stock of loans would appear unnecessary and

computing the volume of balances eligible to be charged to bad debt reserves 
for any one year: the percentage method and the experience method. Neither 
of these methods is effective for most banks at present, however, since with 
the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the volume of balances in bad 
debt reserve accounts at most banks has exceeded the maximum amounts that

After the volume of

real estate loans has increased sufficiently relative to existing reserve 
balances, banks will probably choose the percentage method of calculation, 
since this method will result in higher additions to reserves except under 
nnrlpr the oercentage method banks will be per-
very unusual circumstances. Under tne perce.u.a6 
mitted to increase their reserves against bad debts to an amount equal to 
1.8 per cent of total qualifying loans until 1976. This per cent is sched-
uled to be reduced to 1.2 per cent for the years 1976 to 1981 and will de-
cline to .6 per cent after 1981. After 1986 all banks will be required to 
use the experience method by which the amount to be credited to bad debt 
reserves for a given year will be based on actual loss experience over the 
taxable year and five preceding years. 
The proposed legislation would raise the allowable percentage to 
6 per cent of all real estate loans and contains no provision for any reduc-
tion in the rate with the passage of time. There is, however, a limitation 
on the volume of balances that banks would be able to credit.to reserve 
accounts in any one year. The maximum amount that could be credited is

limited to one-fifth of the amount by which 6 per cent of the outstanding 
volume of qualifying real estate loans at the end of any taxable year 
ending after December 31, 1970 exceeds the existing volume of balances in 
2/ 
bad debt reserve at the start of the taxable year. 
.Impact on tax liabilities 
This change in tax regulations will provide banks with substantial 
tax savings, particularly over the years immediately following passage of 
the regulation. For example, rough calculations indicate that even if their 
real estate loan portfolios were to remain unchanged over the current year, 
banks would be able to increase their bad debt reserves by approximately 
$590 million and thereby reduce their tax liabilities by about 275 million. 
Tax savings of similar amounts would also be obtained in several subsequent 
years (again even if the volume of real estate loans continued unchanged) 
until reserves against the present stock of real estate loans are built up 
to the 6 per cent maximum. Moreover, if real estate loans increase, as 
2? The following example will illustrate the changes that would be intro-
duced by the proposed legislation. Suppose a bank had a portfolio of 
real estate loans composed of $2000 in FHA or VA underwritten loans and 
$8000 in other real estate loans on December 31, 1970. If the Bank s 
bad debt reserve balance for its qualifying real estate loan at that 
time was equal to 1.8 per cent of such loans, the size of this balance 
would have been $144.00 (.018 x $8000). And, under existing regulations, 
at the end of this year, if its eligible loans had risen $1000 it 
could have increased its bad debt reserve account by *18.00 (.018 x $1000) 
to $162.00. 
, , , 
U1 . 
If the proposed legislation were in effect, the bank would be a 
e t c 
increase its bad debt reserve balance for the 1971 tax year by $103--
6 per cent of $11,000 (the volume of total real estate loan outstanding 
at the end of 1971, including VA and FHA underwritten loans) or $660 
less $144 (reserve balance attributable to real estate loans at the 
start of the year) divided by 5.

2284 
they most certainly will, even larger credits to reserves and greater 
, 3/ 
tax savings will be obtained.~ 
Comparison with Regulations on S&Lfs and Mutual Savings Banks 
If adopted, the proposed regulation would place banks on a 
more equal footing with savings and loan associations and mutual savings 
banks with regard to the treatment of bad debt reserves against real estate 
loans. The reduction of the present imbalance in treatment will be of two 
kinds. First allowing banks to maintain reserves against government 
underwritten mortgages gives them the same privilege presently afforded 
nonbank thrift institutions. 
Second, the proposed legislation would allow banks to credit 
reserves against real estate loans in a way similar to that set down for 
nonbank thrift institutions. At present the nonbank thrift institutions 
are given the option of using one of three methods for computing their bad 
debt reserves; the percentage of income method, the "allowable" percentage 
method and the experience method. The latter two methods are exactly the 
17 These estimates are based on the following: The volume of real estate 
loans reported by all insured commercial banks on their December 31, 
1970, Call. Report was approximately $72.5 billion, of which VA and FHA 
underwritten loans accounted for about $10.3 billion. Of the approxi-
mately $6 billion in reserves for bad debt against all types of eligible 
loans on that date the amount attributable to real estate loans not 
underwritten by the government was approximately $1.4 billion. Under 
the terras of the proposed legislation the allowable maximum reserve 
balance against the volume of real estate loans outstanding at the end 
of last year would rise to $4.35 billion (72.5 x 6 per cent), except 
. 
that this balance could not be established in one year. Thus for the 
1971 tax year, even if the volume of real estate loans remained un-
changed, banks would be able to increase reserve balances approximately 
$590 million ($4.35 billion - $1.4 billion/5). 
Given the proximate nature of the above calculations, it seems acceptable 
to proceed on the simplifying assumption that all banks are in a 48 per 
cent tax bracket, so that the tax reduction resulting from the additional 
buildup of reserves will amount to somewhat more than $275 million. 

- 5 -
same as those presently outlined for commercial banks and are generally 
less liberal than the percentage of income method. 
The percentage of income method allows the thrift institution to 
increase reserves against bad debts by an amount equal to a given per cent 
°f qualifying income. However, an overall limitation on the amount to be 
credited to reserves is established under this method which is equal to 
6 per cent of total qualifying real estate loan. The present per cent to 
be applied to qualifying income is around 55 per cent, so that the overall 
limitation of 6 per cent of outstanding loans usually acts'as the effective 
constraint on the quantity of balances credited to reserves. 
It is this overall limitation that is the source of the 6 per 
cent of loans rule specified in the proposed legislation for banks, and 
che proposed legislation appears to place banks on the same footing with 
°ther thrift institutions. However, the percentage to be applied to 
eligible 
income of thrift institutions is scheduled to be reduced in 
successive yearly steps to 40 per cent by 1979. Thus it is possible that 
at seme future date the per cent of income calculation will yield an 
amount below 6 per cent of outstanding loans, so that if the proposed 
legislation for banks is adopted as written, banks could be in a more 
favorable position than the other thrift institutions in some future years. 
tillaget on Real Estate Lending 
The proposed legislation would permit banks to build up substan-
tially larger reserves against real estate loans than against other loans in 
fcheir portfolios. And, in contrast to present practices, the same relatively 

2286 
- 6 -
high reserves also would be allowed against government underwritten mortgages. 
Unless the risk of loss on real estate loans is substantially greater than 
the risk on other types of loans, these higher reserve allowances must be 
viewed as simply a means of stimulating banks to make more real estate 
loans by giving thern a tax saving. Quite obviously, since FHA and VA 
mortgages are essentially risk free, they warrant no reserve at all, let 
alone a relatively high reserve. And it appears difficult to establish 
a case that non guaranteed real estate loans are, in general, more risky 
than other types of loans in banks' portfolios. Thus, it seems reasonable 
to conclude that the legislation will, in effect, provide banks a subsidy 
for making real estate loans. The availability of this subsidy should 
^courage banks to channel a larger proportion of their lendable funds into 
r°al estate mortgages, and should, in particular, increase the attractiveness 
t o banks of government underwritten mortgages. 
To give some idea of the dimension of this inducement, assume that a 
bank is in a 48 per cent tax bracket and that it is presently increasing 
bad debt reserves using the 1.8 per cent formula outlined in the percent-
age method. Under these conditions the effective yield on a conventional 
25-year mortgage with an 8 per cent interest rate would be about 25 basis 
points higher under the proposed legislation than it is under existing 
regulations. The differential, of course, would be even higher for 
government underwritten mortgages, since present regulations permit 
no build up of bad debt reserves for these loans.

Dear Mr. Rommel: 
I am writing in response to your request of August 31, 
1971, for the Board's views on proposals that would: 
(1) Restrict the scope of section 956 of the Internal 
Revenue Code, x-;hicli presently imposes a tax on investments 
in the United States by foreign subsidiaries of United States 
corporations; 
(2) Amend the Interest Equalization Tax to permit 
foreigners to acquire in the United States capital needed 
for direct investment in the United States free of such 
tax; and 
(3) Treat all gain from speculation in foreign currency 
as ordinary income and authorize the Treasury to issue regula-
tions on the time when currency gains and losses are to be 
recognized. 
The Board has asked that I indicate to you that it has not 
had adequate time to analyze the proposals and that it has no 
comments on them at this time. 
Very truly yours,

September 3, 1971 
The Honorable Wright Patman 
Chairman 
Committee on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I am pleased to respond to your letter of June 7, 1971. You enclosed 
a copy of your remarks made in the Congressional Record of June 7, concerning 
the u S e of" the 360-day year in calculating interest, and asked that we review 
tlVe propriety of this practice, its effect on the customers of banks, the 
need for legislative or regulatory action to curb the practice and the 
%ilure to disclose to customers of banks that the practice is being used. 
In discussing the propriety of the use of the 360-day year in the 
computation of interest on loans, it seems appropriate to define tne areas 
appli c a ti 0 n involved. Both the 360- and the 365-day years have proper 
Prices in computing interest on loans. Which basis is used depends upon the 
type Of the loan and the practice of the creditor. 
^tegories of Loans 
Loans can be divided into two basic categories: 
(J) The first category includes instalment obligations, including 
b°th typical consumer loans and typical real estate mortgages, which are 
Payable in equal periodic payments of principal and interest. The finance 
charge may be precompiled, or it may be computed when each payment is 
deceived ' In both cases, payments are usually made monthly, all months are 
treated as equal periods of time, and finance charges are not assessed on the 
1)asis of actual number of days between payments. 
(2) The second category includes loans which are payable with 
interest computed for actual days between payments. 

The Honorable Wright Patman 
-2-
st _C a t e. go r y 
In the case of one group of loans in category (1) , in which the 
finance charge is computed in advance and added to the amount of the obligation, 
it is common practice among financial institutions to use a 360-day year to 
compute interest. In fact, practically all'commercially available monthly 
Payment tables used to compute finance charges on conventional instalment 
loans are constructed on the basis of each month being an equal period of 
time, 30 days, and a year equal to 12 months of 30 days each or 360 days. 
One might ask what happens to the oLher 5 days in a year. If the 
ioan contract runs, for example, three years and is payable in 36 equal instal-
ments on the 10th day of each month, the 5 days each year arc included in 
the full repayment period without any additional finance charge being imposed. 
The rate is a "per annum" rate and the number of days in a year is irrelevant. 
Also, in category (1) is the second group of loans on which interest 
i s computed each month or other fraction of a year (except daily), for example, 
a 
estate mortgage. Whichever period is involved, it is considered to be 
e-qual to every other such period. In the case of monthly computations, 
interest may be computed from the 15th of the preceding month to the 15th of 
thG current month, treating the intervening period as 30 days regardless of 
whether the actual number of days involved is 28. 30, or 31. A. three-month 
loan will, involve finance charges of one-quarter of the amount calculated from 
'Application of an annual rate, a six month loan, one-half of that amount, and 
s° on. The actual number of days in the particular period is ignored. It 
makes no difference in the amount of the finance charge for the year where the 
Credij:oi; considers and treats each month as a period of 30 days. 
Generally, the computation of the finance charge is made by use 
o f tables which are based upon equal payment periods. Each year is treated 
a s 12 months of 30 days each in the preparation, of monthly payment tables. 
T h e effect is that the finance charge per year is no greater by the use of 
tllG 360-day method than by use of the 3 65-day method if neither is mixed in 
i t s application.. This conclusion can be demonstrated by the enclosed compara-
tive table showing a $1,000 loan on which the interest is computed first on 
a 365-day basis compared with the interest on the same loan computed on a 360-
day basis, both at a stated rate of 12% per'annum. In the 365-days-per-year 
imputation, the factor for computing interest is 12% divided by 365 which

chavge by one method results in an annual percentage rate of 8.03% and a 
finance charge computed by another method results in an annual percentage rate 
°f 8.11%, both of these rates may be rounded to the nearest quarter of 1% and 
disclosed as 8%. However, if under one method of computation the annual percentage 
rate is 8.03% and under another method, 8.13%, the first may be disclosed as 8%, 
V 7 hUe the second may be rounded up to 8-1/4% for disclosure. When a stated in-
terest rate exceeds" 9%, the application of a 360-day factor to the actual number 
o f days between payments affects the annual percentage rate which must be disclosed 
to the customer even after rounding. 
Corn, 
LUerc.ial Loans 
The 360-day method is used extensively in category (2) type commercial 
transactions not subject to Truth in Lending. However, Congress excluded business 
transactions from the scope of Truth in Lending on the apparent assumption that 
commercial borrowers were a sophisticated group able to protect themselves and 
n°t in need o£ the protection afforded by the Act. 
inclusions 
It is unlikely that the use of the 360-day method of computation of 
intcrest would adversely affect the consumer where'it is employed in connection 
the typical personal loan, or instalment contract, or residential mortgage 
The consumer is usually affected only in those relatively few loans 
*here the amount of the finance charge or interest is computed on a daily basis, 
a n d even in these instances the effect will normally be reflected in the annual 
PQrcentage rate disclosed to the customer pursuant to the requirements of 
Re8ulation Z 
In view of the complexity of any explanation of the 360-day vs. 
365-day year in computing charges, disclosures of this kind of information 
c°uld bo more confusing than helpful to the customer. Truth in Lending has 
c°ntributed a great: deal toward greater consumer awareness of financing costs 
the Board does not feel that further Federal regulatory action is needed 
beyond the present disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act. M s o 
it 
i s felt that any problems which arise out of the use of the 360-day method by 
lenders in commercial transactions are not of the kind to require special 
le2islative or administrative actions at this time. 
We hope that the foregoing comments will be helpful to you in your 
c°nsideration of the matter. 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Keflin: 
Reference is made to the letter dated August 11, 1971, from 
the Secretary of the Federal Reserve Retirement Plan and Thrift Plan. 
At its meeting on September 2, 1971, the Board of Governors 
approved the action by the Trustees of the Retirement Plan on July .5, 
1971, to amend the Plan, the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, and 
the By-Laws as submitted with that: letter. 
The Board also approved the action on July 27, 1971, of the 
Administrative Committee of the Thrift Plan with respect to the amenc-
ments to the Thrift Plan, Trust Agreement, and By-Laws axso submitted 
with that letter. 
The approval is effective immediately subject, however, to 
receipt: of. a favorable determination by the Internal R-enue S^vice 
as to the continued qualification of the Plans under Sections 401(a) 
and 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

Mr. Paul Breidenbach 
Vice President and 
General Counsel 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 
P.O. Box 6387 
Cleveland, Ohio 44101 
Bear Mr. Breidenbach: 
This refers to your letter of August 13. 1971, enclosing 
four copies of a supplemental retirement agreement dated August 12, 
1971, between the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Dr. Willis 
J. Winn. 
The Board of Governors has approved the agreement as sub-
mitted, and as Secretary of the Board, I have affixed my signature 
in the appropriate place on all copies. One copy of the agreement 
has been retained for the Board's files; the other three copies are 
returned herewith. 
The Board has considered the Bank's request that the con-
ditions of the agreement be modified so as to provide a survivorship 
option compatible to that available under the Retirement Plan and 
has concluded that the addition of such an option not only would 
broaden the conditions of these agreements beyond the purpose for 
which they are initiated but would raise a very real threat to the 
tax-exempt status of the Retirement Plan under Section 401 of the 
Internal Revenue Code. For these reasons the Board has decided that 
the provisions of the supplemental retirement agreements should not 
be broadened by the inclusion of a survivorship option similar to 
that provided"in the Retirement Plan. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

Mr. Emerson G. Higdon 
Chairman of the Board of Directors 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
Chicago, Illinois 
60690 
- Dear Mr. Higdon: 
On October 15, 1970, the Board of Governors approved 
the supplemental retirement allowance agreement dated September 24, 
1970, between the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Mr. Robert P. 
Mayo which would provide Mr. Mayo a minimum retirement allowance, 
under certain stated conditions, equal to 40 per cent of his final 
average salary "(as defined in Section 2.15 of the Rules and Regula-
tions of the Retirement System, as amended effective January 1, 
.1970), . . . . " 
In its consideration of a similar agreement recently sub-
mitted by another Federal Reserve Bank, the Board of Governors 
approved certain changes in the text of the standard agreement which 
(1) took into account recent changes in the Retirement Plan for 
Employees of the Federal Reserve System and, (2) changed the 
definition of final average salary (Paragraph 2) from "(as defined 
in Section 2.15 of the Rules and Regulations of the Retirement 
System, as amended effective January 1, 1970)'' to "(as defined in 
the then current provisions of said Retirement Plan)." 
In its consideration of the recent agreement submitted 
for its approval, the Board directed its staff to bring these changes 
to the attention of your Bank in the event your Board of Directors 
would want to make similar changes in the agreement with Mr. Mayo. 

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
„

/WO* >,<-
Mr. Emerson G. Higdon 
-2-
There is enclosed a copy of the agreement between your Bank 
and Mr. Mayo indicating the type of changes discussed above. 
If your Board of Directors desires to make a change, it may 
either submit a new agreement reflecting both the editorial 
and definitive changes or it may simply submit an endorsement 
to the current agreement dated September 24, 1970, changing . .. ^ 
^ 
that part of the agreement in paragraph 2 referring to the 
definition of final average salary. If a totally new agree-
ment is submitted, it should indicate that it supersedes and 
rescinds that one dated September 24, 1970. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed)• Tynan Smith
