Approved items. The following items were approved unanimously 
after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the Board. Copies are attached under the respective numbers 
indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to the Chairman of the Council 
1 
of Economic Advisers agreeing to 
participate, with other designated 
agencies, in a task force effort to 
consider legal ceilings on interest 
rates generally and designating Mr. 
Partee as alternate to Chairman Martin. 
Letter to all Federal Reserve Banks 
2 
transmitting a letter to be sent to 
the president of each State member bank 
relating to the Civil Rights Act of 
1968 and its applicability to mortgage 
loans. 
Governor Robertson indicated that the banking bulletin 
(Item No. 2) had been discussed by the Coordinating Committee on Bank 
Regulation and that there was agreement that it should be issued on a 
uniform basis by the agencies. A similar communication had already 
been sent to insured savings and loan associations by the Home Loan 
Bank Board. 
Applications for Nassau subsidiaries (Items 3 - 8 ) . 
There 
had been distributed a memorandum from the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation dated April 16, 1969, regarding applications of the 
following to establish subsidiaries in Nassau, Bahamas, or elsewhere 
in the Caribbean: The First National Bank of Boston, Boston, Massa-
chusetts; American International Bank, New York, New York; Republic 

JL«J So 
4/23/69 
-3-
National Bank of New York, New York, New York; The Fidelity International 
Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Wachovia International Invest-
ment Corporation, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and The First National 
Bank of Miami, Miami, Florida. 
In commenting on the applications, Mr. Dahl noted that the 
subsidiaries of First National Bank of Boston and Republic National 
Bank of New York would apparently conduct rather complete banking 
operations at the proposed locations. The other applicants apparently 
did not contemplate more than the equivalent of limited service facilities. 
Governor Robertson stated that he* would vote against approval 
on all six applications. It seemed to him that none of them contemplated 
true full-power banking institutions. He foresaw an accumulation of 
such operations in the Bahamas area, which he felt would be a mistake. 
Governor Brimmer said that he was willing to support the 
proposals of First National of Boston and Republic; however, he would 
abstain from voting on the other applications. 
The applications were approved, Governor Robertson dissenting 
with respect to each of the six applications and Governor Brimmer 
abstaining except with respect to the applications of First National 
Bank of Boston and Republic National Bank, on which he voted for approval. 
Copies of the letters sent to the respective applicants are attached 
as Items 3 - 8 . 
Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Bank of Pennsylvania, Reading, 

1376 
4/23/69 
-4-
Pennsylvania, with Washington Street Bank and Trust Company, also of 
Reading, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation. The conclusion stated that the merger 
would have no adverse competitive effects. 
SEC stock market study. There had been distributed a memoran-
dum dated April 22, 1969, from Mr. Partee regarding a request from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission for assistance in connection with 
the special study it had been authorized by the Congress to conduct 
on the role of institutional investors in the securities markets, and 
especially the stock market. The help requested tentatively dealt 
with two aspects of the study. 
The first related to a portion, to be performed by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research, with respect to the overall growth and 
economic significance of institutional participation in the equities 
market. In this connection the SEC sought either direct financial 
assistance of approximately $50,000 (which was the sum SEC would also 
make available) or indirect assistance in the form of addition of 
personnel to the Board's payroll for the purpose of lending their 
services to the National Bureau. 
The second aspect of the study for which help was requested 
had to do with development of an appropriate questionnaire and survey 
Procedure for use in studying the investment behavior of various 
institutions, including bank trust departments. The SEC would like 

1377 
4/23/69 
-5-
to have financial assistance to support project staff assigned to 
this subject, again either through cash payment or addition of 
staff to the Board's payroll. 
Mr. Partee stated that before proceeding with negotiations 
it would be necessary to have an indication from the Board as to 
whether special assistance to the SEC project was considered 
warranted, and, if so, the extent to which the Board wished to 
become involved. 
Governor Sherrill expressed the view that the study could 
be a meaningful one, with results of interest to the Federal Reserve, 
and that the Board should lend support. He did not have any par-
ticular figure in mind, although he would not exceed $100,000 either 
directly or indirectly. He would prefer that assistance be in the 
form of a monetary payment because making the services of Board 
staff available would interfere with ongoing System programs. The 
System, however, had expertise in the area of questionnaire design 
and field testing, so he would suggest cooperation by the staff in 
that respect, particularly since bank trust departments were involved, 
but he would not like to see the subpoena power used. 
Governor Brimmer stated that if the Board could have a hand 
in selecting staff rather than simply make a cash payment to the SEC, 
it seemed to him there would be certain advantages. First, the 
Board would not be so openly substituting its funds for appropriated 

X3V8 
4/23/69 
-6-
funds. Second, it was possible that as a by-product the Board 
would eventually obtain the permanent services of competent per-
sonnel. In addition, the Board might be in a position to have 
more to say about the direction and content of the study. 
Mr. Brill observed that, while the staff had been involved 
for a long time in conversations with the SEC relating to the proposed 
study and had exerted some influence in orienting the study along 
lines that would make it useful from the standpoint of the Board, 
that influence had diminished as the SEC built up its project 
staff and developed plans. He would not now hold out hope that 
the Board could continue to exert a meaningful influence on the 
course of the study unless the Board, in giving assistance, stip-
ulated the end-product sought. 
After Mr. Partee had commented on complications that might 
be involved if the Board hired personnel for loan to the SEC, 
Governor Brimmer said he would not insist on that procedure as a 
condition to providing assistance unless it appeared feasible. 
Governor Sherrill made clear that his main concern had to do with 
tying up Board staff resources for work on the study. 
Governor Robertson recalled that the project had been dis-
cussed for many months. He was of the view that the Board should 
make a contribution in some form. However, before entering into 
any agreement, the Board should have general knowledge as to the 

4/23/69 
-3-
direction of the overall study. With respect to the portion relating 
to bank trust departments, the Board should take the position that it 
wanted to be consulted on questionnaire preparation. If, after looking 
into the matter, the Board was satisfied with the general approach, it 
should go ahead with either direct or indirect financial assistance. 
Governor Maisel suggested that there might be some advantage 
in focusing the Board's contribution on that portion of the study to 
be conducted by the National Bureau, and Governor Brimmer agreed that 
that appeared to be a promising area. 
Mr. Hexter inquired whether financial assistance by the Board 
should be brought to the attention of the appropriate committees of 
Congress, but it was the general view that such a course would not be 
necessary in light of the history of Congressional testimony. 
Following further discussion, Governor Sherrill was authorized 
to negotiate with the SEC, keeping in mind the points raised by members 
of the Board. 
Chairman Martin withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
Williamsburg Conference. Mr. Nettles, who was serving as 
Special Assistant to the Chairman for the purpose of the forthcoming 
Conference of Central Bank Governors of the Western Hemisphere to be 
held in Williamsburg, Virginia, beginning April 26, 1969, distributed 
copies of the program. He then commented on the arrangements made for 
visiting dignitaries, the highlights of the program, and the extent of 
Participation by Federal Reserve personnel. 

4/23/69

. 
' 
Mr. Nettles advised that the estimated expenses of the 
Conference had been revised upward from $20,000 to $38,625, and 
explained the reasons. The revised cost did not include the 
expenses of wives of members of the Board's staff who would be 
on duty at the Conference, and he recommended that the Board 
approve the payment of those expenses also. 
Following discussion, the Board accepted the revised 
estimate of expenses and referred to Governor Sherrill, with power 
to act, the question of paying the wives' expenses. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Paul: 
In response to your letter of April 15, 1969, we would 
be glad to participate, with the other agency members you mention, 
in a task force effort to consider legal ceilings on interest 
rates generally. There are clearly enough outstanding problems 
and questions on this issue to warrant a careful look at the 
subject. 
I myself will be glad to work with the task force. 
In addition, I would like to designate Chuck Partee, Associate 
Director of our Division of Research and Statistics, as the 
senior staff member with primary responsibility for this area 
and as my alternate.

Dear Sir: 
There are enclosed copies of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 
and a letter from Chairman Martin to the president of each State member 
bank calling attention to certain provisions of the Act applicable to 
State member banks. The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation are sending similar letters to national 
and State insured nonmeraber banks, respectively. 
It will be appreciated if you will forward to the president 
of each State member bank in your District a copy of the Chairman's 
letter and a copy of the Civil Rights Act. In doing so, you may wish 
to inform the recipients that the Federal Reserve Bank also has 
responsibility for determining that there is compliance with the ap-
plicable provisions of the Act by those, financial institutions under 
its jurisdiction. A supply of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 is being 
shipped to your Bank today; it will be necessary for your Bank to repro-
duce the Chairman's letter. 
The FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
expect to mail copies of the Act and a statement similar in all 
substantial respects to State nonmember insured banks and national 
banks, respectively, on May 2, 1969. It is hoped the Reserve Banks 
also can make mailings on May 2, so that all banks will have the 
information at the same time. The Home Loan Bank Board mailed a copy 
of the Act and similar statement to all insured savings and loan 
associations some time ago. 
Very truly yours, 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
/ 
Deputy Secretary.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF EACH STATE MEMBER BANK 
The Civil Rights Act of 1968, which became effective 
January 1, 1969, contains provisions applicable to State member 
banks that are in the business of making mortgage loans. These 
provisions make it a violation of Federal law to deny a loan or to 
discriminate in fixing the terms of a loan, made for the purpose 
of purchasing, constructing, improving, or maintaining a dwelling, 
because of the race, color, religion, or national origin of the 
loan applicant or the present or prospective occupants of the 
dwelling. The pertinent provisions are contained in Section 805 
of Public Law 90-284, -a copy of which is attached hereto. 
Section 804 of the Act prohibits discrimination in the 
sale or rental of housing, on account of race, color, religion, 
or national origin. Insofar as a State member bank or any affiliate 
or subsidiary of a State member bank is engaged in the sale or rental 
of real estate, either owned in its own right or as trustee, the 
provisions of Section 804 are applicable. 
The Act confers authority on the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) to investigate complaints of violations of 
the Act and to eliminate or correct violations by informal methods 
of conference, conciliation and persuasion. In cases where the 
Secretary is unable to obtain voluntary compliance, complainants 
are given the right to commence civil suits in Federal district 
court to enforce the rights granted by the Act. In such a suit, the 
court may grant as relief a temporary or permanent injunction, and 
may award to the plaintiff not more than $1,000 punitive damages 
together with court costs and attorney's fees. 

1384 
iTi/V* *'*"*'" 
It is expected that each State member bank will have 
reviewed its mortgage lending policies, forms and procedures in 
light of the requirements of the Act. Bank counsel should be 
consulted, if necessary, to assure that such policies, forms and 
procedures comply with the Act. 
Although primary authority and responsibility for 
administering the Act is placed in the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development (Section 808(a)), the Board of Governors also 
has a responsibility to require compliance with the applicable 
provisions of the Act by those financial institutions under its 
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Board expects all State member 
banks under its supervision to comply with the letter and spirit 
of applicable provisions of the Civil Rights Act. Federal Reserve 
System examiners have been instructed to include in their reports 
any apparent violations of the Act disclosed during the course of 
any regular or special examination.

Act not "engaged in banking"; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, FNBB 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of BBT-2 as it may require from time

(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by BBT-2

Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1)

that the investment now being approved will be made within the guide-
lines established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities

of Bo ston International, and that due consideration is being given 
to the priorities contained therein.

Gentlemen: 
i. l i ! i 
In accordance with the request contained in your letter 
of May 13, 1968, the Board of Governors grants consent for your 
Corporation ("AIB") to purchase and hold all the outstanding shares, 
except qualifying shares, of Zilkha Bank Limited ("ZBL"), Nassau, 
Bahamas, at a cost of approximately $225,000, and to invest approx-
imately $95,000 in new shares of ZBL to be issued, provided the 
shares are acquired within one year from the date of this letter. 
(It is understood that since the date of the application, the 
name of ZBL has been changed to "American International Bank (Bahamas) 
Limited.") 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of ZBL by AIB is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) That AIB shall not hold, directly or indirectly, any 
shares of stock in ZBL if ZBL at any time fails to 
restrict its activities to those permissible to a 
corporation in which a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, with 
the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase and 
hold stock, or if ZBL establishes any branch or agency 
or takes any action or undertakes any operation in 
the Bahamas or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to AIB; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, AIB 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding the 
activities of ZBL as it may require from time to time; 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by ZBL be 
reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if ZBL were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act; 

1388

(4) That AIB shall not carry on its books the shares 
of ZBL at a net amount in excess of its proportionate 
share of the book capital accounts of ZBL, after 
giving effect to the elimination of all known losses; 
and 
(5) That adequate information covering ZBL's operations 
will be maintained at your head office and will be 
available to the Board and its accredited representatives. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with 
copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
of Association, and By-Laws of ZBL. 
The foregoing consent is g.iven with the understanding that

established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect 
as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities of 
your Corporation and that due consideration is being given to the 
priorities contained therein.

Republic National Bank of New York, 
Fifth Avenue at 40th Street, 
New York, New York. 10018 
Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of October 17, 1968, the 
Board of Governors grants permission, pursuant to Section 25 of the 
Federal Reserve Act and Regulation M, for Republic National Bank of 
New York ("RNB"), New York, New York, to purchase and hold all the 
outstanding shares except for directors' qualifying shares, of 
Republic National Bank of New York (International) Limited ("RNBI"), 
a banking subsidiary to be established in Nassau, Bahamas, at a 
total cost of approximately $1,000,000, provided the shares are 
acquired within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed holding of the shares 
of RNBI by RNB is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) That such shares be disposed of as promptly as prac-
ticable if RNBI shall in any manner engage in any activity 
or take any action whatsoever that would not be permissible 
if RNBI were a corporation organized under Section 25(a) 
of the Federal Reserve Act not "engaged in banking"; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors RNB will 
furnish the Board with such reports regarding the activi-
ties of RNBI as it may require from time to time; 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by RNBI be 
reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if RNBI were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act; and 
(4) That adequate information covering RNBI's operations 
will be maintained at your head office and will be 
available to the Board and its accredited representatives.

Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as 
they relate to restrictions set forth in Section 211.9(a), (b), and 
(c) of Regula tion K. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
of Association, and By-Laws of RNBI. 
The Board understands that RNB may guarantee payment of 
the notes issued by RNBI, thus making them direct, primary obligations 
of that bank payable at its office in New York, and that the proceeds 
thereof will be used by the subsidiary in the ordinary course of its 
banking business. In these circumstances, such notes would be "deposits" 
of RNB under Sections 204.1(f) of Regulation D and 217.1(f) of Regu-
lation Q. Such notes would therefore be subject to the requirements 
and restrictions of those Regulations unless one of the exceptions 
specified in those Sections were applicable or unless both the notes 
and the guaranty were expressly made payable only outside the United 
States. 
The Board has noted that Republic National Bank of New 
York has consistently been over its foreign asset position regarded 
as appropriate for the bank under the foreign credit restraint pro-
gram. However, it is understood from the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York that as of March 24, 1969, the bank had reduced its foreign 
assets outstanding to an amount within its ceiling. The foregoing 
consent is given with the understanding that your bank's foreign 
loans and investments will remain within the guidelines; that the 
investment now being approved will be made within those guidelines; 
and that due consideration is being given to the priorities contained 
therein. 
Very truly yours,

except qualifying shares, of The Fidelity International Corporation

the shares are acquired within one year from the date of this letter, 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of FICB by FIC is granted subject to the following condi-
tions: 
(1) That FIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in FICB if FICB at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those per-
missible to a corporation in which a corporation 
organized under Section 25(a) of the Federal Re-
serve Act could, with the consent of the Board of 
Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if FICB 
establishes any branch or agency or takes any 
action or undertakes any operation in the Bahamas 
or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the time 
would not be permissible to FICB; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, 
FIC will furnish the Board with such reports re-
garding the activities of FICB as it may require 
from time to time; 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by

(4) That adequate information covering FICB's opera-
tions will be maintained at your head office and 
will be available to the Board and its accredited 
representatives. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is re-
quested that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, with copies of Articles of 
Association, Memorandum of Association, and By-Laws of FICB. 
The Board has noted that as of February 28, 1969, the 
foreign loans and investments of your Corporation and The Fidelity 
Bank exceeded the guideline ceiling applicable under the foreign 
credit restraint effort now in effect. The foregoing consent is 
given with the understanding that those foreign loans and investments 
will be reduced as soon as possible to a level consistent with the 
guidelines; that the investment now being approved will be made 
within those guidelines; and that due consideration is being given 
to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours,

Wachovia International Investment 
Corporation, 
P. 0. Box 3099, 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 27102 
Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of February 15, 1968, the 
Board of Governors grants consent for Wachovia International Investment 
Corporation ("WIIC"), to continue to hold all the shares of Wacayman 
Banking Corporation Ltd. ("WBC"), Grand Cayman Island, British West 
Indies, at a cost of approximately $48,000. 
The Board also grants consent for WIIC to continue to hold 
shares of WBC after WBC purchases and holds all the shares of Wacayman 
Bank and Trust Company Ltd. ("WBTC"), Grand Cayman Island, British 
West Indies, at a cost of approximately £10,000, provided such shares 
of WBTC are acquired within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the holding of shares of WBC by 
WIIC is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) That WIIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, any 
shares of stock of WBC if WBC at any time fails to restrict 
its activities to those permissible to a corporation 
in which a corporation organized under Section 25(a) of 
the Federal Reserve Act could, with the consent of the 
Board of Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if WBC 
establishes any branch or agency or takes any action or 
undertakes any operations in the Cayman Islands or else-
where, in any manner, which at the time would not be 
permissible to WIIC; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, WIIC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding the 
activities of WBC as it may require from time to time; 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by WBC be 
reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if WBC were a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act; and 

1394 
Wachovia International Investment 
Corporation 
-2-
(4) That adequate information covering WBC's operations will 
be maintained at your head office and will be available 
to the Board and its accredited representatives. 
The Board's consent to WIIC's continued holding of shares 
of WBC after WBC holds the shares of WBTC is granted subject to the 
same conditions as prescribed in the immediately preceding paragraph, 
WBC being substituted for WIIC [except in (2)] and WBTC for WBC. 
However, subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends until further notice the provisions of subparagraph (1) of 
the conditions so far as they relate to restrictions on loans granted 
by WBTC in the Cayman Islands in the currency of that territory. 
It is requested that the Board of Governors be furnished, 
through the Federal Reserve Bank of-Richmond, with copies of Articles 
of Association, Memorandum of Association, and By-Laws of both WBC 
and WBTC. 
The Board understands that Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, 
National Association, may guarantee payment of the notes issued by 
WBC and WBTC, thus making them direct, primary obligations of that 
bank payable at its office in Winston-Salem, and that the proceeds 
thereof will be used by that bank's foreign affiliates in the ordinary 
course of their banking business. In these circumstances, such notes 
would be "deposits" of that bank under Sections 204.1(f) of Regulation 
D and 217.1(f) of Regulation Q. Such notes would therefore be subject 
to the requirements and restrictions of those Regulations unless one 
of the exceptions specified in those Sections were applicable or unless 
both the notes and the guaranty were expressly made payable only outsid 
the United States. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding that 
the investment in WBC now being approved will be made within the guide-
lines established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities 
of your Corporation and Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, National 
Association, and that due consideration is being given to the prioritie 
contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.
