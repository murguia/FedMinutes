owned subsidiary, Arcturus Investment and Develop-
ment, Limited, Montreal, Canada, shares of Industrie

Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Worcester County National 
Bank, Worcester, Massachusetts, with County Bank of Worcester, National 
Association, also of Worcester, was approved unanimously for transmittal 
to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion stated that the 
proposed merger would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal to the Comp-
troller of the Currency of a report on the competitive factors involved 
in the proposed purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of 
Orange County Bank, San Juan Capistrano, California, by Southern 
California First National Bank, San Diego, California. The conclusion 
read as follows: 
There appears to be little competition existing 
between Southern California First National Bank, San 
Diego, and Orange County Bank, San Juan Capistrano; 
however, there is potential for more competition 
between them in view of the State's branch banking 
statutes. The overall competitive effect of the 
merger would be slightly adverse. 
Merger applications. The following merger applications were 
approved unanimously after consideration of background material that 

4560 
12/31/68 
-4-
had been made available to the Board, including, with respect to each 
application, a favorable staff recommendation: 
Application of American Bank and Trust Company, 
Lansing, Michigan, to consolidate with Woodruff 
State Bank, De Witt, Michigan. 
Application of The Sedan State Bank, Sedan, Kansas, 
to merge with The Peru State Bank, Peru, Kansas. 
It was understood that an order and statement reflecting each of 
these decisions would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Bank holding company applications. The following applications 
under the Bank Holding Company Act were approved unanimously after 
consideration of background material that had been made available to 
the Board, including, with respect to each case, a favorable staff 
recommendation: 
Application of Eastern Trust Financial Associates, 
Bangor, Maine, to become a bank holding company through 
the acquisition of all of the voting shares of Eastern 
Trust and Banking Company, also of Bangor, and its three 
majority-owned subsidiary banks (Lincoln Trust Company, 
Lincoln, Maine; Millinocket Trust Company, Millinocket, 
Maine; and Guilford Trust Company, Guilford, Maine). 
Application of Bank Securities, Inc.(NSL), Alamogordo, 
New Mexico, to become a bank holding company through 
the acquisition of voting shares of Security Bank and 
Trust, Alamogordo, and Citizens State Bank, Vaughn, 
New Mexico. 
(Applicant already owned a majority of the 
voting shares of The First State Bank, Cuba, New Mexico.) 
It was understood that an order and statement reflecting each of these 
decisions would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Treasury proposal for immediate credit. On September 19, 1968, 
Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Carlock addressed a letter 

4561 
12/31/68 
-5-
to President Morris of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as Chairman 
of the Committee on Fiscal Agency Operations of the Conference of 
Presidents, in which Mr. Carlock referred to the existing arrangement 
under which the account of the Treasurer of the United States with the 
Federal Reserve Banks was divided into two parts for accounting and 
reporting purposes, namely, "available funds" and "items in process of 
collection." For reasons outlined in his letter, Mr. Carlock recommended 
that the Reserve Banks give immediate credit for all deposits in the 
Treasurer's account. He expressed the hope that the recommendation 
would be approved at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents on 
December 16, 1968. 
On December 18 President Scanlon of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago, Chairman of the Committee on Collections, informed the 
Board that the Subcommittee on Collections had recommended against the 
Treasury proposal, one reason being that the change would increase 
float by $346 million on an average daily basis, and that the Conference 
had unanimously supported the Subcommittee's recommendation. 
President 
Scanlon inquired whether the Board was in general agreement with that 
action. 
Governor Daane asked whether the proposed change would mean an 
increase in funds available for Treasury expenditure, with a resulting 
reduction in the necessity for borrowing, and Mr. Farrell replied that 
additional flexibility would be provided. Governor Daane observed that 

4562 
12/31/68 
-6-
the proposed arrangement might mean, then, less resort to direct borrow-
ing from the Federal Reserve. However, he could not see that the 
advantage to the Treasury would be substantial. Since the change would 
involve some administrative difficulty for the Federal Reserve, he was 
inclined, on balance, to agree with the Subcommittee, particularly in 
view of the resultant increase in float. 
In response to a question, Mr. Farrell said that the Subcommit-
tee's exploration had been thorough. It included a check with the 
Trading Desk, which had raised a mild objection. The original Federal 
Reserve Act, Mr. Farrell noted, provided that reserves should consist 
of actually collected funds, with a strong implication that the Federal 
Reserve Banks had no authority to give credit for uncollected funds. 
The New York Reserve Bank's attorneys had taken the view that the pro-
posed procedure would be questionable. 
Governor Brimmer inquired whether the proposal would simplify 
record-keeping procedures, as the Treasury had indicated, and Mr. 
Farrell responded that there was no disagreement on that point. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that the real issue was 
that if the Federal Reserve Banks gave immediate credit and did not 
charge the accounts of depositors at the same time, the Treasury would 
in effect be borrowing from the Reserve Banks. Governor Daane agreed 
and observed that the Federal Reserve was liberal with respect to use 
of the special borrowing privilege. Governor Sherrill remarked that, 

. 4563 
12/31/68 
-7-
moreover, once the Treasury had absorbed the additional funds that 
would be made accessible, there would appear to be little advantage 
to the Treasury from that point forward. 
Inquiry was made whether Mr. Carlock had met with representa-
tives of the Conference of Presidents. 
It was suggested that if such 
a meeting had not occurred, one should be arranged to allow complete 
presentation of the arguments of the Treasury before the Board took a 
position with respect to the action of the Conference. 
There was unanimous agreement with this suggestion. 
Use of examination report by auditors (Item No. 10). Mr. 
OfConnell reported that Union Trust Company of Maryland, Baltimore, 
Maryland, had requested, through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 
permission to make available to auditors the member bank's copy of the 
report of its most recent examination. Vice President Nosker of the 
Richmond Reserve Bank recommended that the request be granted. Mr. 
O'Connell's recommendation (in which Mr. Leavitt concurred) was that 
the report be made available except for certain portions relating to 
classified loans. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that, since a member 
bank was permitted to make its examination report available to officers 
or employees, it would also be appropriate to make the report available 
to a firm of auditors employed to perform a service. The same prin-
ciple, he thought, would apply to disclosure to counsel employed by a 
bank. 

4564 
12/31/68 
-8-
Governor Brimmer inquired whether loan information would not 
be necessary to performance of the auditor's function, and Governor 
Sherrill noted that disclosure of the names of individuals perhaps 
should be avoided, since a judgment regarding creditworthiness was 
written into the report. Governor Robertson observed that there was 
a confidential relationship between a bank and its attorneys or audi-
tors, just as between a bank and its directors. 
Mr. Solomon said that, while he had sympathy for Governor 
Robertson's view, an argument could be made on the other side. A 
lawyer representing a bank in a damage suit would not be entitled to 
see parts of the examination report that had no bearing on his case. 
An auditor had a legitimate interest in certain parts of the report, 
but other parts had little relation to his task. The use of relevance 
as a criterion would suggest that no greater access to the report be 
granted than was necessary in given circumstances. 
Further discussion developed agreement with a suggestion that 
the bank be authorized to make the report available to the auditors, 
with recommendation that it exercise judgment regarding portions of 
the report that should be withheld. A copy of the letter sent to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond pursuant to this action is attached 
as Item No. 10. 
Parking space. There had been distributed a memorandum dated 
December 24, 1968, from Mr. Kelleher discussing problems relating to 

4565 
12/31/68 
-9-
parking space for employees in view of the expected construction of 
the Board's annex building on the present parking lot. A lease had 
been negotiated with the management of Columbia Plaza, an apartment 
development at 23rd Street and Virginia Avenue, N.W., for (1) 100 
parking spaces to be leased in January 1969 at the rate of $30 per 
space per month, and (2) a minimum of 200, and up to 300, additional 
spaces at that location to be leased on or before April 1, 1969, at 
the same rate. Approval was requested for the Division of Adminis-
trative Services to have the lease executed so that as much parking 
space as possible would be available when excavation for the annex 
building began. It was expected that present arrangements for parking 
at the Watergate development would be terminated, with persons now 
using that space transferring to the initial spaces to be leased from 
Columbia Plaza. 
It was further recommended that, if the spaces at Columbia 
Plaza proved insufficient, the Division of Administrative Services 
be given permission to negotiate for any additional space required 
at a new garage to be constructed on 20th Street between E and F 
Streets, N.W. That space was expected to be available about May 1, 
1969, but at a higher rate. 
Chances were small that it would be possible to obtain a total 
of 400 spaces in the area by the time excavation for the annex build-
ing was begun, and therefore it would be necessary to allocate the 

12/31/68 
-10-
leased parking spaces among present permit holders. Approval was 
requested for the Division of Administrative Services to develop a 
program for such allocation. 
After discussion the Board authorized the execution of the 
lease for the spaces at Columbia Plaza, as well the other steps 
mentioned in Mr. Kelleher's memorandum. 
All members of the staff then withdrew except Messrs. Kenyon, 
Brill, Hexter, Johnson, and O'Connell. 
Kansas City officer salaries (Item No. 11). Unanimous approval 
was given to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City approv-
ing the payment of salaries to James A. Cacy and Thomas E. Davis, each 
as Research Officer and Economist, and to Jim G. Knoche as Planning 
Officer, at the rates fixed by the Bank's Board of Directors. A copy 
of the letter is attached as Item No. 11. 
Salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presidents (Items 12-14). 
Unanimous approval was given to letters to the Chairmen of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland approving the 
payment of salary to the Presidents and First Vice Presidents of the 
respective Banks for the year 1969 at rates discussed with the respec-
tive Chairmen by representatives of the Board's Committee on Organiza-
tion, Compensation, and Building Plans, subject to such rates being 
fixed by the Boards of Directors of the Banks concerned. Copies of 
the letters are attached as Items 12-14.

Board staff. Stanley J. Sigel and Tynan Smith, currently 
Associate Advisers in the Division of Research and Statistics, were 
appointed Advisers in that Division effective January 1, 1969, with 
annual salary in each case at the rate of $26,500. 
Mr. Brill then withdrew. 
Robert F. Sanders, currently Senior Attorney in the Legal 
Division, was appointed Assistant General Counsel effective January 1, 
1969, with annual salary at the rate of $22,000. 
Pauline B. Heller, currently Senior Attorney in the Legal 
Division, was appointed an officer of that Division, with title of 
Adviser, effective January 1, 1969, with annual salary at the rate 
of $22,500. 
Messrs. Hexter and O'Connell then withdrew. 
The Board approved, effective January 1, 1969, annual salary 
at the rate of $24,000 for John Kakalec, Controller. 
Atlanta Reserve Bank (Item No. 15). Governor Sherrill reported 
a conversation with President Kimbrel of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta with respect to filling the position of First Vice President 
at that Bank. President Kimbrel thus far had no specific progress to 
report. Therefore, it would be acceptable to him if the Board would 
approve for the interim the payment of salary at the current annual 
rate to First Vice President Moody. 

4568

After discussion, approval was given to the sending to the 
Chairman of the Atlanta.Bank of a letter in the form attached as 
Item No. 15, Governor Brimmer voting "no" because he did not want to 
be associated with what might appear to be an endorsement of further 
service by Mr. Moody as First Vice President. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letter of October 30, 1968, 
regarding the acquisition by your Corporation of 29,000 shares of 
Unitech Limited ("Unitech"), Reading, England, at a cost of 
$519,912, or $87,912 (20 per cent) more than the amount approved 
by the Board in its letter of September 26, 1968. 
The Board cannot condone acquisitions of stock by Corpora-
tions chartered under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act 
("Edge Corporations") without prior approval when such approval is 
required. Inasmuch as the purchase price of the Unitech shares was 
subs tantially greater than the amount approved, prior approval 
should have been obtained for the increased investment. 
The Board of Governors, however, interposes no objection 
to the continued holding by your Corporation of the recently ac-
quired shares of Unitech in view of the circumstances surrounding 
the increased cost of the Unitech shares and your assurance that 
such investment was made within the guidelines set forth under the 
foreign credit restraint program. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Mr. John L. Nosker, Vice President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 
Richmond, Virginia. 23213 
Dear Mr. Nosker: 
This is in reply to your letter of December 10, 1968, 
enclosing a letter request from the Secretary and Treasurer of 
Union Trust Company of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, for the Board's 
authorization to permit Union Trust Company to give access to the 
accounting firm of Ernst and Ernst of the report of examination by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond of Union Trust Company as of 
October 14, 1968. The report of examination would be furnished to 
Ernst and Ernst in connection with an audit of the bank. 
The Board has approved action by Union Trust Company of 
Maryland in making available to representatives of Ernst and Ernst 
the bank's copy of the report of examination as of October 14, 1968, 
together with copies of such earlier reports of examination of the 
bank as its directors believe requisite to a proper audit of the bank. 
The Board's action was taken on the assumption that, as with all docu-
ments in a member bank's possession of a non-public nature, Union 
Trust Company will exercise sound discretion in making available to 
Ernst and Ernst those portions of the report of examination considered 
relevant to the auditing function to be performed. 
It will be appreciated if you will transmit the substance of 
this letter to Union Trust Company of Maryland. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.
