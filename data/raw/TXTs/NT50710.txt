First National City Bank. The Board approved, Governor Robertson 
dissenting, an application by First National City Bank, New York, New 
York, to organize a corporation under section 25(a) of the Federal 
Res erve Act to be located in Miami, Florida, and named First National 
City Bank (Interamerica). A copy of the letter sent to First National 
City Bank pursuant to this action and which transmitted a preliminary 
permit is attached as Item No. 1. 
Irving International. The Board approved, Governor Robertson 
dissenting, a request by Irving International Banking Corporation, New 
York, New York, for consent to amend its articles of association so as 
to change the corporation's name to Irving Interamerican Bank and relo-
cate its home office and activities to Miami, Florida. A copy of the 
letter sent to Irving International pursuant to this action is attached 
as Item No. 2. 
Birmingham-Bloomfield Bank. In a memorandum dated December 18, 
1970, Governor Robertson discussed the situation of Birmingham-Bloomfield 
Bank, Birmingham, Michigan, a nonmember insured bank of the "Parsons 
Group," particularly the possible need of the bank for more Federal 
Reserve credit than the amount up to $40 million currently available on 
a conduit basis through Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago felt that if a need for 
additional funds should arise and if Bank of the Commonwealth should 

12/21/70 
-3-
fail to ask permission to increase its loan to the Birmingham bank, 
then--assuming the System felt that the Birmingham bank should be 
kept open, at least at this time--the natural step to take would be 
to invite Bank of the Commonwealth to increase its credit to the Birming-
ham bank and shift all of the credit to a new basis. The new basis 
would involve repledging the Birmingham bank's assets with the Reserve 
Bank and changing the present arrangement under which Bank of the 
Commonwealth lent to the Birmingham bank at the rate it got the funds 
from the Reserve Bank so that Bank of the Commonwealth would add some 
spread in the rate, probably about 1/2 of one per cent. 
In the interest of contingency planning, in which the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation concurred, Governor Robertson recommended 
(1) that the Board authorize the Reserve Bank to accept assets of Birming-
ham-Bloomfield Bank as collateral for Reserve Bank credit extended to 
Bank of the Commonwealth, with the latter bank also remaining liable 
on the credit, and (2) that the Reserve Bank be authorized to approach 
Bank of the Commonwealth in advance along the lines indicated, either 
directly or through Birmingham-Bloomfield Bank, such authority to be 
utilized only in the event of necessity. 
After discussion, Governor Robertson's recommendation was 
approved, with the understanding that the authority granted to the 
Reserve Bank would not be activated except after agreement that the 

31*{3 
12/21/70 
-4-
clrcumstances were appropriate. 
Governor Daane abstained from partici-
pation in the Board's action because of the fact that certain members 
of his family had loans and deposit accounts at Birmingham-Bloomfield 
Bank. A copy of the letter sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
pursuant to the Board's action is attached as Item No. 3. 
Legislative developments. Mr. Cardon reported on developments 
with respect to pending legislation, particularly the one-bank holding 
company bill. 
Following Mr. Cardon
1
s report, a suggestion was made that the 
Board should have in its files a review and interpretation of the 
legislative history of the bill. 
In the terms in which the suggestion 
originally was made, it contemplated that such a document would be 
prepared for the Board by an outside consultant. However, an alterna-
tive suggestion later was made that such a paper be prepared by the 
Board's staff, with the understanding that it could then be submitted 
to a consultant for comment if that seemed desirable. A suggestion 
also was made that a member or members of the Board's staff who had 
participated in the discussions by the Board of the pending legislation, 
including consideration of requests that had been received from the 
Congress for views with respect to it, prepare for the Board's files 
a paper reviewing the significant issues that had arisen and the 
interpretations placed by the Board upon provisions of the legislation 
in considering questions received and the response to them 0 

345)4

After discussion of these suggestions, it was understood that 
the staff would endeavor to prepare documentation responsive thereto, 
returning to the Board for further guidance if necessary. 
Margin credit developments. Mr. Stoffels reported on margin 
credit developments, basing his comments on a memorandum he had prepared 
under date of December 18, 1970, a copy of which has been placed in the 
Board's files. 
Statement of income. Against the background of reasons dis-
cussed in a memorandum from the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
dated December 17, 1970, the Board approved unanimously the sending to 
all State member banks subject to Regulation F, Securities of Member 
State Banks, of a letter warning against deviation from the caption 
structure of the regulatory statement of income format in published 
bank annual reports for 1970. A copy of the letter sent to those banks 
pursuant to this action is attached as Item No. 4. 
Chairman Burns joined the meeting at this point. Miss Carmichael, 
Assistant Secretary, Mr. Metzger, Assistant to the Secretary, and 
Mr. Plotkin, Senior Attorney, Legal Division, also entered the room. 
Equal employment opportunity program. In a memorandum of 
December 16, 1970, Mr. Holland, as the Board's Director of Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity, outlined the progress of efforts to develop an equal 
employment opportunity action program during the past year. 
The 

31f)5 
12/21/70 
-6-
memorandum contained recommendations that (1) a revised action plan, 
in the form attached to the memorandum be sent to the Civil Service 
Commission in response to the Commission's recent request; (2) the 
Board member in charge of internal administrative affairs be authorized 
to approve budget overexpenditures resulting from placement of quali-
fied minority persons in anticipation of reasonable turnover; (3) a 
supplemental action plan containing goals and programs in excess of 
Civil Service Commission requirements be developed and utilized inter-
nally at the Board; and (4) a new full-time position with responsibility 
in the equal employment opportunity area be created within the Office 
of the Secretary. The fourth recommendation contemplated that the occu-
pant of the new position would be named the Board's Director of Equal 
Employment Opportunity and would have officer status. Initially, how-
ever, for a period of perhaps six months, the occupant of the position 
might be designated as an Assistant to the Secretary (Equal Employment 
Opportunity). 
Following comments by Mr. Holland based on his memorandum and 
discussion of several questions raised in the light thereof, the recom-
mendations contained in the memorandum were approved unanimously. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Discount rate. Chairman Burns noted that the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had acted, subject to review and determination 

12/21/70 
-7-
by the Board of Governors, to establish a discount rate of 5-1/4 
(rather than 5-1/2) per cent. He said that, while he was sympathetic, 
in his opinion it would be better to take action on the matter around 
the middle of January, assuming interest rate patterns at that time 
continued about as they were now. The discount rate had been reduced 
very recently., Even so, the rate was presently a bit out of line with 
short-term market rates, and if the present pattern of rates continued 
a further reduction in the discount rate in January would seem appro-
priate if the Board wished to continue to follow a practice of effect-
ing smaller and more frequent changes in the discount rate in order to 
keep it in alignment with market rates 0 
It was mentioned that it would be desirable if a number of the 
Reserve Banks had proposals before the Board for consideration by the 
middle of January, and the Chairman agreed. Reference was made in this 
connection to a letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reflect-
ing a reluctance on the part of most of the Bank's directors to move 
further on the discount rate, and this led to a discussion during which 
a suggestion was made that the staff be asked to prepare a letter, copies 
of which might be sent to all of the Reserve Banks, reflecting concern 
on the basis of comments that had been received that the Reserve Bank 
directors might not be looking at the proper things in formulating 
judgments with respect to discount rate policy. Another suggestion was 
that a letter, sent to the Chairmen of the Federal Reserve Banks, might 

3 1 9 7 
12/21/70 
-8-
call attention to the fact that the Board had been encouraging discus-
sions of the discount rate regularly at directors' meetings. As a 
further suggestion, it was mentioned that a letter to the Reserve Bank 
Chairmen could be based on the discussion of the discount rate that 
had occurred at the recent meeting of the Conference of Chairmen, the 
record of which was to be distributed in the near future. 
These and other similar possibilities were debated, including 
the question whether a communication should more appropriately be 
addressed to the Chairmen of the Reserve Banks or to the Presidents. 
It was pointed out that a subcommittee of the Conference of Presidents 
was currently engaged in writing a report on adaptation of System 
techniques to a practice of effecting smaller changes in the discount 
rate at more frequent intervals. An observation also was made that 
perhaps the Board was not in a position to go too far in communicating 
with the Reserve Banks until a decision had been reached on implementing 
the recommendations that had resulted from the Fundamental Reappraisal 
of the Discount Mechanism. 
Mr. Holland then commented that he had been planning to visit 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York within the next few days and that 
he could, if the Board so desired, pass along to President Hayes, who 
was Chairman of the Committee on Discounts and Credits of the Conference 
of Presidents, some of the flavor of today's discussion. It was agreed 
that that would be desirable and that the question of sending some 
letter along the lines that had been suggested should be held in abeyance. 

12/21/70 
-9-
In a further comment, the Chairman said it was his impression 
that substant ive discount rate discussions were now being held regu-
larly by the directors of at least half of the Reserve Banks and that 
the d irectors of those Banks were pleased with this development because 
they felt that they were playing a more significant role in the deve-
lopment of System policy. However, the situation appeared to be uneven 
and he understood that at some Banks there was no substantive discus-
sion of the discount rate on a regular basis. 
Mr. Holland noted that there had been a suggestion that all 
of the Presidents be informed when one or more Banks had placed before 
the Board a proposal for a change in the discount rate 0 
There was 
general agreement that such information should be made available in 
the interest of good intra-System communications, although some members 
of the Board expressed reservations about the extent of the information 
that should be communicated and warned against the possibility of leaks 
They suggested, by way of illustration, that it might be inadvisable 
to identify the Bank or Banks whose directors had acted or to discuss 
the prospective disposition by the Board of the proposal or proposals 
that had been placed before it. 
In the light of this discussion, it was understood that 
Mr. Holland would communicate to the Reserve Bank Presidents that a 
proposal to change the discount rate had been received from one Reserve 

a i f i i ) 
12/21/70 
-10-
Bank and was under discussion and that it would appear desirable for 
all of the Presidents to have a discount rate discussion at the next 
regularly scheduled directors' meeting. 
Open market operations. There was a general discussion of 
operations undertaken by the Trading Desk in the light of the directive 
issued at the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, includ-
ing an explanation of the understandings of the Open Market Account 
Management and the Board's staff concerning appropriate implementation 
of the directive. 
Euro-dollars. Chairman Burns referred to the actions taken 
by the Board in an effort to moderate the repayment by U.S 0 banks of 
the ir Euro-dollar liabilities and commented that, as the Board had 
recognized at that time, additional measures probably would be required 
to cope with the problem. He mentioned conversations that he had had 
with certain bankers who had expressed the hope that the matter would 
not be left in its present posture indefinitely from the standpoint 
of their own operations. The Chairman then suggested that one possi-
bility might be for the Treasury to offer, perhaps on an auction basis, 
special securities to U.S. banks with Euro-dollar liabilities outstand-
ing to their foreign branches. The initial offering might be in an 
amount such as $500 million, and if necessary consideration could then 
be given to other offerings later. 
In addition, actions might be taken 
through the Bank for International Settlements or by the Federal Reserve, 

3500 
12/21/70 
-11-
possibly along lines that had been suggested by Governor Mitchell. 
Another possibility would be a sale of special securities by the Export-
Import Bank. 
After a general discussion of the possibilities that had been 
outlined, it was agreed that contingency planning should go forward 
in order that when further attention was given to the problem in January, 
preparations would have been made to put into place promptly such pro-
grams as the Board might want to initiate on its own behalf or suggest 
for consideration by other parts of the Government. 
Chairman Burns withdrew at this point to keep another appoint-
ment. 
Economic and financial review. Members of the research staff 
entered and presented a review of economic and financial developments 
in the usual weekly format. Copies of the statistical materials prepared 
for this review have been placed in the Board's files, along with copies 
of the individual briefings. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland and Kenyon then 
withdrew. 
Reserve Bank officer salaries. 
In a memorandum dated Decem-
ber 18, 1970, the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building 
Plans recommended approval by the Board of the payment of salaries to 
Reserve Bank Presidents and First Vice Presidents for the period 

3501 
12/21/70 
-12-
January 1 through February 28, 1971, at the annual rates specified 
in an attachment to the memorandum. 
The general policy of the Committee had been not to make 
exceptions to the salary guidelines except in unusual circumstances. 
In the case of the Presidents, the only exception was at Chicago, 
where an increase was recommended in conformity with pre-employment 
negotiations. 
With respect to the First Vice Presidents, the Committee felt 
that small increases should be approved in those instances where 
increases for Senior Vice Presidents would result in the payment of 
salaries to them at rates higher than those being paid to the First 
Vice President. Approval of four other increases was recommended to 
maintain a proper relationship based on service to the System* 
However, 
in all cases where exceptions to the guidelines were involved, the 
Reserve Banks concerned would be advised that the increase now granted 
must be taken into consideration in connection with requests for salary 
increases in the future. 
After discussion, the Board approved unanimously the payment 
of salaries to the respective Presidents and First Vice Presidents at 
the annual rates recommended by the Committee. Those rates are shown 
in the letters subsequently sent to the Chairmen of the respective 
Banks. Copies of those letters are attached under Items 5 through 16. 
inclusive.

12/21/70 
-13-
During the foregoing discussion it was noted that in the near 
future consideration would have to be given to the reappointment of 
Presidents and First Vice Presidents for five-year terms of office 
beginning March 1, 1971, and question was raised whether any mechanism 
was contemplated for performance appraisal. After consideration of this 
point, it was understood that Governors Maisel and Sherrill would endeavor 
to bring a proposal to the Board. 
In a memorandum dated December 17, 1970, the Committee on 
Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans recommended that the 
Board approve the payment of salaries at the annual rates indicated in 
attachments to the memorandum to officers of the Federal Reserve Banks, 
other than Presidents and First Vice Presidents, for the period January 1 
through December 31, 1971. 
After discussion, the Board approved unanimously the payment of 
salaries to the respective officers at the annual rates recommended by 
the Committee. Those rates are shown in the letters subsequently sent 
to the respective Reserve Banks. Copies of those letters are attached 
under Items 17 through 28, inclusive. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors has approved the Articles of 
Association and the Organization Certificate, dated October 28, 
1970, of First National City Bank (Interamerica), Miami, Florida,

tered under the laws of the United States or of a State of the United 
States, or by firms or companies the controlling interest in which 
is owned by citizens of the United States; and (3) that of the 
authorized capital stock specified in the Articles of Association 
at least 25 per cent has been paid in in cash and that each share-
bolder has individually paid in in cash at least 25 per cent of his

December 23, 1970 
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) 
Mr. Robert P. Mayo, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 
Chicago, Illinois. 
60690 
Dear Mr. Mayo: 
In the light of discussions between Mr„ James R, Morrison, 
Senior Vice President of your Bank, and Mr. Frederic Solomon, Direc-
tor of the Board's Division of Supervision and Regulation, the Board 
of Governors lias given consideration to the making of contingency 
plans to be available in the event a substantially increased need for 
funds for Birmingham-Bloomfield Bank, Birmingham, Michigan (BBB), a 
nonmember bank, should develop. 
It is understood that Bank of the 
Commonwealth, Detroit, Michigan (BOC), is now lending approximately 
$40,000,000 to BBB, pursuant to permission granted by your Bank under 
the Cease and Desist Order to which BOC is subject. 
It is further 
understood that if BOC should request authority from your Bank to 
increase that credit to BBB, your Bank will authorize such increase„ 
However, if BOC were unwilling to request an increase in this 
lending authority under present arrangements, some different arrangement 
might become necessary if circumstances arose in which substantial addi-
tional funds were to be needed by, and supplied to, BBB. In order that 
there may be advance planning to deal with such a contingency in the 
event it should develop, the Board, pursuant to its letter of March 17, 
1970, (S-2126) and Section 201.5 of Regulation A , has granted permission 
for your Bank to accept as security for advances or discounts assets 
acquired from, or bearing the signature or endorsement of, BBB. 
This 
permission will enable your Bank to accept the repledge of assets of BBB. 
However, BOC, or any other bank so pledging such assets with you, would, 
of course, also continue to remain liable on the credit. 
It is understood that, if necessary, (1) your Bank would author-
ize the conversion of some or all of the lending by BOC to BBB to the new 
basis of repledging BBB assets with your Bank, and/or (2) the present 
terms by which BOC lends to BBB at the rate BOC gets funds from your Bank 
might be changed to a basis on which BOC would add some spread to the 
rate, probably about 1/2 per cent. 

3508 
M r . Robert P . Mayo, President 
- 2 -
In order that contingency plans may be available in advance 
of the actual need for their use, your Bank is authorized to make 
arrangements along the lines indicated above with BOC or some other 
bank; however, it should be clearly understood that these plans would not 
be utilized except in case of necessity and only then after consultation 
between Mr 0 Morrison of your Bank and Mr. Solomon of the Board's staff. 
Sincerely,

Item No. 4

ADDRESS OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE: 
TO THE BOARD 
December 22, 1970 
In 1969, the Board joined with the other Federal bank 
supervisory agencies, Securities and Exchange Commission and repre-
sentative committees of industry and the accounting profession in 
a significant revision of bank financial reports. 
Such coordinated 
effort was intended to improve financial reporting practices of 
banks and assure continued reasonable uniformity of bank financial 
statement presentations. 
The Board has recently learned that some consideration is 
being given in the industry to deviate from the caption structure 
of the regulatory statement of income format in published bank annual 
reports for 1970. 
In the Board's judgment, the contemplated action 
involving the use of substitute captions would be contrary to the 
commitment of all interests to attain the benefits of reasonably 
comparative financial data on bank results of operation. 
A communication similar in substance is to be issued by 
the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. The Federal bank supervisory agencies have been informed 
that the Securities and Exchange Commission has considered the matter 
and supports the position of the Federal bank supervisory agencies. 
Very truly yours, 
Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Deputy Secretary

December 23, 1970 
Dear Jim: 
iff 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
has approved the payment of salary to President Morris at the 
annual rate of $50,000 for the period January 1 through February 28, 
1971, if so fixed by your Board of Directors. The Board has 
also approved the payment of salary to First Vice President 
Latham at the annual rate of $42,500 for the period January 1 
through February 28, 1971, as fixed by your Board of Directors 
and reported in your letter of December 14. 
With respect to the salary for First Vice President 
Latham, since this increase was an exception to the guidelines 
set. for this position, this amount should be considered as an 
advance against the increase available under the guidelines in 
any future request for a salary increase.

Item No. 6

DEC 
2 1 1970 
Dear Al: 
As I have already indicated to you orally, the Board of 
Governors carefully considered the question of changing salary ranges 
for presidents and first vice presidents, and it decided that no 
changes would be made this year. Therefore, the Board cannot approve 
the recommendation contained in your letter of November 13. 
It, 
however, did approve compensation for President Hayes, effective 
January 1, 1971, if so provided by your Board of Directors, at the 
annual rate of $90,000, the top of the current range for his position. 
The Board also approved compensation for First Vice President 
Treiber, effective January 1, 1971, if so provided by your Board 
of Directors, at his current annual rate of $60,000, the top of the 
existing range for his position. 
It was determined that below the level of president and 
first vice president certain exceptions to existing ranges would 
be allowed and, therefore, the Board approved compensation for 
Senior Vice Presidents Coombs and Holmes at the annual rate of 
$56,300, effective January 1, 1971.
