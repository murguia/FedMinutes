Other appropriate members of the staff also 
attended portions of the meeting. 
Trust Company of Georgia. The Board authorized the issuance 
of orders (copies attached under Items 1 and 2) reflecting approval on 
February 11, 1971, of the applications of Trust Company of Georgia, 
Atlanta, Georgia, to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of 
(1) Peachtree Bank and Trust Company, Chamblee, Georgia, and (2) Trust 
Company of Georgia Bank of Sandy Springs, Sandy Springs, Georgia. 
First Florida Bancorporation. The Board unanimously approved 
the application of First Florida Bancorporation, Tampa, Florida, to 
acquire shares of Bank of Tavares, Tavares, Florida, and authorized the 
issuance of an order reflecting this decision. A copy of the order is 
attached as Item No. 3. 
First National Bancorporation. On October 22, 1970, the five 
members of the Board then present unanimously denied the application 
°f The First National Bancorporation, Inc., Denver, Colorado, to 
acquire shares of The Exchange National Bank of Colorado Springs. 
Governor Mitchell later stated that upon reflection he would like to 
change his vote to one of approval, and he had now furnished to the 

458 
2/22/71 
-10-
members of the Board a statement in support of his position and a 
rationale for approval. 
A motion by Chairman Burns that the case be reconsidered was 
carried by unanimous vote. 
Governor Mitchell summarized the grounds on which he favored 
approval, as brought out in the papers he had distributed, copies of 
which have been placed in the Board's files. 
The ensuing discussion touched upon the evolving banking struc-
ture in Colorado, the question whether de novo entry into Colorado 
Springs was reasonably to be expected, and the position of the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
Governor Daane then expressed agreement with Governor Mitchell's 
Position. He did not believe that denial was justified on the basis 
of conjecture regarding possible de novo entry or acquisition of a 
smaller bank. He regarded the present proposal as advantageous in 
terms of improved services, competition, and economies of scale. 
/ 
Governors Robertson and Maisel reaffirmed their previous stand 
for denial and Governor Brimmer cited the finding of significantly 
adverse competitive effects by the Department of Justice as well as an 
indication in the background material that the applicant might seek to 
acquire a smaller bank. 

2/22/71 
-4-
Governor Sherrill said that after further study he would 
reverse his previous vote for denial. He thought that present 
competition would be enhanced; with respect to potential competition 
he was impressed with Governor Mitchell's appraisal of the market 
as unfavorable to de novo entry. 
Chairman Burns stated that in his view Governor Mitchell's 
analysis was strengthened by the view of the Banking Markets Section 
that the proposal would result in no significant effect on existing 
competition. 
The application was then approved, Governors Robertson, Maisel, 
and Brimmer dissenting. It was understood that an order and statement 
reflecting this decision would be drafted for the Board's consideration, 
and that a dissenting statement also would be prepared. 
Nassau branches. A number of applications were pending for 
the establishment of "shell" branches in Nassau, Bahamas, action having 
been deferred in the hope that the underlying basic issues could be 
resolved. 
At the meeting on February 16, 1971, Governor Mitchell suggested 
that Nassau branches be permitted if they were precluded from accepting 
interest-bearing deposits from nonbank customers and were required to 
file regular reports on loans to U.S. residents. Staff discussed those 
suggested constraints in memoranda dated February 18 and 19, and the 

46C 
2/22/71 
-5-
Legal Division explored tax aspects of the operation of Nassau branches 
in a memorandum dated February 19. Data requested by Governor Brimmer 
regarding nonbank depositors and borrowers were presented by the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation in a memorandum of February 18. 
In a memorandum of February 18 Governor Mitchell expressed 
general concurrence with the staff analysis, but expressed the view if 
tax advantages were simply an incident to a banking practice that served 
a public interest it was not the System's responsibility to deviate 
from its usual regulatory objectives. He suggested that a shell branch 
might be approved, wherever located, if it was operating as the sole 
home office access to Euro-dollars, while offices sought solely or 
primarily as tax havens could be approved or disapproved according to 
each Board member's analysis. The prohibition on the acceptance of 
interest-bearing deposits by nonbank depositors at Nassau branches 
would require banks seeking greater latitude in their operations to 
establish full-service branches or affiliates. 
In discussion several modifications of Governor Mitchell's 
proposal were suggested, and some Board members stressed the desirabil-
ity of emphasizing distinctions between domestic and foreign business

of U.S. banks. Comments were made on the need to enable U.S. banks 
to compete with foreign institutions, the difficulty of defining a 
"branch" in the light of evolving banking practices, and the need for 

461 
2/22/71 
-10-
regular reporting for purposes of surveillance. Governor Robertson 
reiterated his objections in principle to "shell" branches. 
It being apparent that there were substantial differences of 
views regarding the basic issues, the staff was requested to develop 
additional material presenting alternative approaches to the problem. 
The pending applications were then discussed, and agreement 
was reached on language that would caution the applicants, if their 
applications were approved, regarding possible modification of the 
Board's present position. The applications of the following institu-
tions to establish branches in Nassau were then approved, Governors 
Robertson and Brimmer dissenting, and, with respect to the applications 
of Bankers Trust Company and First National Bank of Boston, Governor 
Mitchell also dissenting. Copies of the letters sent to the applicants

shares of Federal Trust Company, Waterville, Maine. The Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston also recommended denial, but the Banking Markets Section 
recommended approval. 
In the spring of 1970 the Board had approved an essentially 
similar application involving use of a "phantom bank." The Supreme 
Court of Maine ruled that that proposal violated State law by preju-
dicing the rights of dissenting stockholders. The revised proposal was 
for a direct acquisition of shares. A protest had been received from 

463

Mr. Napoleon Marcou, who had also objected to the original proposal. 
After discussion the application was approved, Governors 
Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer dissenting. It was understood that 
an order and statement reflecting this decision would be prepared for 
the Board's consideration, and that a dissenting statement would also 
be prepared.

by the Arkansas legislature of pending legislation that would prohibit

lation was enacted on February 5.

had decided not to follow that suggestion. A draft of denial order 
accompanied the memorandum. 
Discussion brought out that an officer of the holding company 
had requested orally that the Board delay action on the Stephens 
application for 30 days, in the hope that the proponents could obtain 
Permissive State legislation. However, a consensus developed against 
Such a delay.

The application was then denied by unanimous vote, and issuance 
of the order reflecting this decision was authorized. A copy of the

Pending legislation. The following letters were approved 
unanimously. Copies are attached as indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to Chairman Patman of the House Committee 
15 
on Banking and Currency urging that Congress make 
permanent the authority granted in 1966 for flex-
ible, coordinated establishment of maximum rates 
of interest payable on time and savings accounts. 
Letter to the Office of Management and Budget 
16 
regarding a draft bill known as the "Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1971." 
Demand deposits at mutual savings banks. Governor Sherrill 
stated that he had received a letter from the Presidents of the 
Bankers Associations of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, 
and a visit from representatives of those Associations, regarding 
legislation proposed in those States to extend demand deposit powers 
(personal checking accounts) to mutual savings banks. The commercial 
banks in those States believed that such an extension of powers was 
an issue of national consequence. The letter noted that the subject 
was being studied by the President's Commission on Financial Structure 
and Regulation and urged that the Federal Reserve lend support in 
seeking to postpone State legislation until the Commission's report was 

465 
2/22/71 
-10-
available. Also, the bankers associations had requested that President 
Morris of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston appear before the Connecticut 
legislature in opposition to the proposal. 
Discussion reflected doubt about the advisability of testimony 
by President Morris, and a suggestion was made that the State bankers be 
reminded of the Board's general practice of refraining from involvement 
in State legislation. Comments were made on the need to develop a Board 
position on the issue involved, and the extent to which the Board had 
moved toward such a position. 
A 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was agreed that Governor 
Sherrill would reply to the State Bankers Associations in the light of 
the comments made. 
Stock market developments. Mr. Stoffels of the Research Division 
reviewed recent margin credit and stock market developments. A suggestion 
was made that it would be useful to have such a review more frequently 
than once a month, and it was understood that that would be done. 
All members of the staff except Mr. Holland then withdrew, and 
the Chairman discussed briefly relations with the Administration. 
Chairman Burns then withdrew to keep an outside appointment, 
and a number of officers and staff who had attended the earlier part of 
the meeting returned to the room. 
Money market review. The usual weekly economic and financial 
review was presented; copies of the statistical charts and tables 

466

prepared for the purpose of today's review have been placed in the 
Board's files along with copies of the individual briefings.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
I n the Matter of the Application of 
TRUST COMPANY OF GEORGIA, 
Atlanta, Georgia, 
approval of acquisition of assets and 
assumption of liabilities of Peachtree 
Bank and Trust Company, Chamblee, Georgia. 
ORDER APPROVING APPLICATION FOR 
ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND 
ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES UNDER 
BANK MERGER ACT 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to the 
Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), an application by Trust Company of 
Ge°rgia, Atlanta, Georgia ("Trust Company"), a member State bank of the 
^Gderal Reserve System, for the Board's prior approval of the merger of 
t^at bank with Peachtree Bank and Trust Company, Chamblee, Georgia 
^ Peachtree Bank"), by means of the purchase of assets and assumption 
liabilities of Peachtree Bank. As an incident to the merger, the 
°ffices of Peachtree Bank would become branches of Trust Company. 
^otice of the proposed merger, in form approved by the Board, has been 
^lished as required by said Act. 
In accordance with the Act, the Board requested reports on the 
Petitive factors involved from the Attorney General, the Comptroller 
of t, 
cne Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The 
°at(1 has considered all relevant material contained in the record in 

4 6 J C? 
- 2 -
the light of the factors set forth in the Act, including the effect 
the proposal on competition, the financial and managerial resources 
and prospects of the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of 
the communities to be served, and finds that: 
Trust Company (deposits $470 million) and six banks (aggregate 
dePosits $284 million), which it controls through its wholly-owned subsid-
ia*y registered bank holding company, hold about 11 per cent of the 
deposits of commercial banks in Georgia. Together they comprise the 
second largest banking organization in the State. 
(All banking data are 
as of June 30, 1970.) Consummation of the proposed merger would not sub-
stantially increase the concentration of banking resources in the State. 
Trust Company operates 20 offices, all within the city limits 
o f Atlanta. Peachtree Bank (deposits $15 million) operates its two 
offices in DeKalb County, about three to five miles northeast of the 
City limits of Atlanta. Trust Company was instrumental in organizing 
achtree Bank in 1960, and the banks have been closely associated since 
t^at time. Trust Company has furnished three chief executive officers 
to 
Peachtree Bank, as well as other officers and employees. In addition, 
st Company provides credit services for Peachtree Bank, assists it 
its investments, and serves as its principal correspondent. In 
or the close relationship which has existed between Trust Company 
Peachtree Bank since the inception of the latter, it may be reasonably 
deluded that present and potential competition would neither be fore-
c l o 
Qed by approval of the application nor encouraged by its denial. 

46S

The Board concludes that consummation of the proposed merger 
W o u l d not have a substantially adverse effect on competition in any 
relevant area. Considerations relating to the financial and managerial 
resources and prospects of the banks involved are regarded as consistent 
wi-th approval of the application. Customers of Peachtree Bank will benefit 
through more convenient access to a full range of banking services. There-
considerations relating to convenience and needs lend some support 
to approval of the application. Based upon the foregoing, it is the 
^°ard's judgment that consummation of the proposed merger would be in the 
Public interest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered. On the basis of the findings summarized 
ab°ve, that said application be and hereby is approved, provided that 
merger so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth 
Calendar day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three 
0t*ths after the date of this Order, unless such period is extended for 
0 cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant 
to ^legated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, February 22, 1971. 
Voting for this action: Chairman Burns and Governors Robertson, 
Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, and Sherrill. 
Absent and not voting: Governor Brimmer.

There has come before the Board of Governors, puriuant to the

chief executive officers and other officers to Sandy Springs Bank. 
In 
Edition, Trust Company provides credit services for Sandy Springs Bank, 
S s l s ts it in its investments, and serves as its principal correspondent. 
n view of the close relationship which has existed between Trust Company 
Sandy Springs Bank sincc the inception of the latter, it may be 
6asonably concluded that present and potential competition would neither be

The Board concludes that consummation of the merger would

Item No. 12 
2/22/71 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C„ 
In the Matter of the Application of 
FIRST FLORIDA BANCORPORATION, 
Tampa, Florida, 
for approval of acquisition of 80 per 
cent or more of the voting shares of 
Bank of Tavares, Tavares, Florida. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK 
STOCK BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
Section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
( l 2 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by First Florida Bancorporation, 
Tampa, Florida ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding company, 
the Board's prior approval of the acquisition of 80 per cent or 
^re of the voting shares of Bank of Tavares, Tavares, Florida 
("Tavares Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
V;rltten notice of receipt of the application to the Commissioner 
0 f Banking for the State of Florida, and requested his views and 

474 
- 2 -
recommendation. The Commissioner recommended approval of the 
application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in 
the Federal Register on January 6, 1971 (36 Federal Register 109), 
providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposed transaction. A copy of the 
application was forwarded to the United States Department of Justice 
for its consideration. The time for filing comments and views has 
expired and all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
fche factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
and managerial resources and prospects of the Applicant and the banks 
concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities to be 
served and finds that; 
Applicant presently controls 17 banks with aggregate deposits 
o f approximately $347 million, representing 2.8 per cent of all deposits 
o f commercial banks in Florida. (All banking data are as of June 30, 
l 9 7 o» adjusted to reflect holding company acquisitions approved by the 
B°ard through December 31, 1970.) Upon acquisition of Tavares Bank 
($13 million deposits), Applicant would remain the sixth largest 
Registered bank holding company in Florida. On the basis of deposits, 
T 
avares Bank ranks sixth among the ten banking organizations in Lake 
Co 
°unty, which approximates the relevant market, and controls 9.3 per 

3 
475 
H 
cent of market deposits. It appears that there is no significant 
competition between Tavares Bank and any of Applicant^ present 
t. 
iji 
subsidiary banks, of which the nearest to Tavares Bank are two banks 
ii: 
in Seminole County and one in Orange County, about 35 miles distant, 
A number of banks are located in each of the intervening areas between 
Applicant's subsidiaries and Tavares Bank. Branch banking is not 
permitted under Florida law, and there appears to be little likelihood 
that Applicant would establish a de novo office in Lake County. 
Thus, it appears that consummation of this proposal would not 
eliminate significant existing competition nor foreclose potential 
competition. Affiliation with Applicant may enhance the ability of 
Tavares Bank to compete with the larger banks in its area without 
having any adverse effect on the smaller banks located there. 
On the basis of the record before it, the Board concludes 
that consummation of the proposed acquisition would not have an 
mJ 
!• 
' 
adverse effect on competition in any relevant market. The financial 
i 
condition, managements and prospects of Applicant, its subsidiaries, 
and Tavares Bank are regarded as satisfactory* Applicant proposes 
t o make specialized services available to customers of Tavares Bank. 
Thus, considerations concerning community convenience and needs lend 
s°me support to approval of the application. It is the Board's 
judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
interest, and that the application should be approved. 
••!• I 

476 
It is hereby ordered. For the reasons in the findings 
summarized above, that said application be and hereby is approved, 
provided that the acquisition so approved shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the date of this Order, 
unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, February 22, 1971.

Gentlemen: 
. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to La Salle National Bank, Chicago, Illinois, 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the Federal 
Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, and to 
operate and maintain such branch subject to the provisions of such 
Section and of Regulation M. 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch will be used for developing new international business and 
not as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
United States. It is also understood that there is to be no con-
tact with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, 
staff, and bookkeeping may, at least in part, be supplied under 
contract by another party. 
In view of the special character of this operation, the 
foregoing permission is granted subject to a searching review of 
these types of facilities now being conducted by the Board and 
after due notice may be withdrawn or modified. The foregoing 
permission is also granted on the condition that adequate information 
covering the branch's operations will be maintained at your head 
office and will be available to the Board and its accredited 
representatives. The Board should be promptly informed of any 
modification in the branch's methods of operation, including 
changes in any contract under which services are supplied to the 
branch. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before March 1, 19 72, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date.

Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago, when the branch is opened for business, 
furnishing information as to the exact location of the branch. The 
Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Nassau. 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits 
payable only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the 
States of the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt 
from any limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 
and Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such brandies are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D (but see Sec-
tion 213.7 of Regulation M). The general purposeof these exemptions 
is to allow foreign branches of United States banks to compete 
abroad with foreign banks. In these circumstances, it has long 
been and continues to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System 
to discourage deposits by United States residents to foreign branches 
of United States banks unless such deposits have been placed to 
serve a definite, necessary purpose in connection with foreign or 
international transactions outside the United States. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
funds provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated 
capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign 
assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. In 
view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 
investments on the balance of payments, the above consent is given 
with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's operations 
maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the 
United States. 
The Board has noted that as of January 31, 1971, the 
foreign loans and investments of your bank exceeded the guideline 
ceiling applicable under the foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect. The foregoing approval is given with thp understanding that 
those foreign loans and investments will be reduced as soon as possible 
to a level consistent with the guidelines; that any investment required 
under the approval new being granted will be made within those guide-
lines ; and that due consideration is being given to the priorities 
contained therein. 
Very truly yours,

Under Secti on 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits 
payable only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the 
States of the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt 
from any limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 
and Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation' D (but see Sec-
tion 213.7 of Regulation M). The general purpose of these exemptions 
is to allow foreign branches of United States banks to compete 
abroad with foreign banks. In these circumstances, it has long 
been and continues to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System 
to discourage deposits by United States residents to foreign branches 
of United States banks unless such deposits have been placed to 
serve a definite, necessary purpose in connection with foreign or 
international transactions outside the United States 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
funds provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated 
capital, advan ces, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign 
assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. In 
view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 
investments on the balance of payments, the above consent is given 
with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's operations 
maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the 
United States. Accordingly, it is understood that any investment 
required will be made with in the guidelines established under the 
foreign credit restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the 
foreign lending and investment activities of your bank and that due 
consideration is being given to the priorities contained therein.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to The First National Bank of Boston, Boston, 
Massachusetts, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the Federal 
Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas , and to 
operate and maintain such branch subject to the provisions of such 
Section and of Regulation M. 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch will be used for developing new international business and 
not as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
United States. It is also understood that there is to be no con-
tact with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, 
staff, and bookkeeping may, at least in part, be supplied under 
contract by another party. 
In view of the special character of this operation, the 
foregoing permission is granted subject to a searching review of 
these types of facilities now being conducted by the Board and 
after due notice may be withdrawn or modified. The foregoing 
permission is also granted on the condition that adequate information 
covering the branch's operations will be maintained at your head 
office and will be available to the Board and its accredited 
representatives. The Board should be promptly informed of any 
modification in the branch's methods of operation, including 
changes in any contract under which services are supplied to the 
branch. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before March 1, 1972, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date. 

The First National Bank of Boston 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal

of United States banks unless such deposits have been placed to

international transactions outside the United States. Your attention 
is called to the statement of this policy contained in the letter to 
member banks with foreign brandies, dated June 3, 1969, a copy of 
which is enclosed. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign brandies,

Reference is made to your application dated" August 27, 
1970, requesting the Board's permission to establish a branch of 
your bank in Paris, France. 
It is understood that the proposed branch would conduct 
a limited range of activities with customers not resident of France, 
as permitted under French regulations, and that the branch would 
have no contact with the local public. ... 
The Board is currently conducting a searching review of 
limited-service facilities overseas of member banks. In view of 
the unique character of the branch which you propose to establish, 
hoth as to location and the activities which would be conducted, 
the Board has decided to withhold action on your application pending 
completion of that review. 
The Board wished you to be advised of this decision and 
that a conclusion in the matter will be reached in the near future.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
/ 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
FIRST ARKANSAS BANKSTOCK CORPORATION, 
Little Rock, Arkansas, 
for approval of acquisition of 80 per 
cent or more of the voting shares of 
The Stephens Security Bank, Stephens, 
Arkansas. 
ORDER DISAPPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
Action 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by First Arkansas Bankstock 
Corporation, Little Rock, Arkansas, the only registered bank hold-
in8 company in Arkansas, for the Board's prior approval of the 
acquiaition of 80 per cent or more of the voting shares of The 
Stephens Security Bank, Stephens, Arkansas. 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
bitten notice of receipt of the application to the State Commicoioner 
Banking, s and requested his views and recommendation. The Commissioner 
teccnaacnded approval unless legislation were to be. approved prohibiting 
company ej:pansion. 

Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on December 9, 1970 (35 Federal Register 18699) 
providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposal. Subsequent to the filing 
of the application, on February 5, 1971, the State of Arkansas 
enacted legislation prohibiting the formation and expansion of 
multi-bank holding companies (Act 47 of the Sixty-eighth General 
Assembly of the State of Arkansas). Pursuant to section 7 of the 
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1846), and the case of 
Whitney National Bank v. Bank of New Orleans, 379 U.S. 411 (1965), 
the Board is precluded from approving acquisitions by holding com-
panies in those States in which such acquisitions are prohibited 
by State legislation. Due to this conclusion , the Board has neither 
reached nor considered the merits of the application and expresses 
no view thereon. 
It is hereby ordered. For the reasons set forth above, 
that said application be and hereby is denied. 
By order of the Board of Governors, February 22, 1971. 
Voting for thia action: Chairman Burns and Governors 
Robertson, Mitchell, Daane, Haieel, Brimmer, and Sherrill.

February 22, 1971 
The Honorable Wright P a t m a n 
Chairman 
Committee on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
A s you know, the authority granted by Congress in 1966 for 
flexible, coordinated establishment of m a x i m u m rates payable on 
time and savings accounts will expire on M a r c h 22 unless action is 
taken to extend it. I a m writing on behalf of the Board of Governors 
to urge that this authority be m a d e a permanent part of the law. 
This recommendation does not, of course, m e a n that rate 
ceilings should be m a d e permanent. O n the contrary, w e hope that 
in time economic and financial conditions will warrant a suspension 
°f such ceilings to allow m o r e competition among depositary 
institutions for the savings of the public. Freer play for market 
forces in determining flows of savings into such institutions and 
into the securities market should promote m o r e efficient use of 
financial resources and m o r e equitable rewards to small and large 
savers. Recognizing that ceilings are not always useful, Congress 
in 1966 provided that ceilings should be discretionary rather than 
Mandatory, thereby authorizing the regulatory agencies to suspend 
them when it is appropriate to do so. 
If Congress should allow the statutory provisions regarding 
rate ceilings to revert to what they were before the 1966 amendments, 
ceilings would become mandatory for insured banks. At the s a m e time 
the authority to set different rates for deposits of varying sizes would 
e*pire, as would the statutory authority for the Federal H o m e Loan 
&ank Board to fix rate ceilings for institutions under its jurisdiction.

A return to the pre-1966 law on rate ceilings might not prove 
too disruptive under current conditions in financial markets. At 
other times, however, it could force the retention of ceilings when 
they were no longer needed, or require imposition of ceilings in an 
inflexible fashion with adverse results in particular markets, such 
as the mortgage market. The Board urges, therefore,. that the 
Congress m a k e Public L a w 89-597 permanent by repealing 
section 7, rather than extending this authority for a further 
temporary period. 
Sincerely,

Mr. C. William Fischer, for 
Assistant Director for 
Legislative Reference 
Office of Management and Budget 
Washington, D. C. 20503 
Dear Mr. Fischer: 
This is in response to the recent request of the Office of 
Management and Budget for priority treatment of the Board's views on 
titles III, IV, and V of a HUD draft bill, "Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1971." These portions of the bill would consolidate, 
simplify, and in certain cases liberalize existing authority for Federal 
Housing Administration mortgage insurance, low-rent public housing, and 
related federal programs. 
Consolidation of existing legislation in this general area 
seems desirable as a means of simplifying and unifying the ground rules 
under which these programs operate. Such changes should enhance the 
potential of the programs for supplementing the operations of private 
mortgage and housing markets. It will be helpful, for example, to make 
permanent the flexible authority of the housing Secretary to set maximum 
contract interest rates on insured loans and mortgages at whatever 
levels are needed to meet the market. Providing a testing period for 
the proposed dual interest rate system will give an opportunity to 
explore how far it may be appropriate to move toward interest rates on 
insured loans and mortgages that are completely market determined. 
Whatever greater flexibility can be achieved, of course, will allow 
insured loans and mortgages to compete more readily with contract rates 
on conventional mortgages as well as with other capital market instru-
ments. And it will broaden the potential scope of the secondary market 
for Government underwritten mortgages. 

5 C 1 
Mr. C. William Fischer 
-2-
The Board would like to point out issues raised by three 
major features of the draft bill. One concerns the definition of 
potential recipients of rent and home ownership assistance. By basing 
eligibility solely on the test of whether income falls short of the 
median, the bill would apparently qualify one-half of all households in 
the country, and without posing any additional tests of eligibility such 
as asset holdings, condition or suitability of present dwelling accommo-
dations, or ability to obtain satisfactory quarters without benefit of 
federal assistance. This proposed broad definition of eligibility 
stands in contrast to the limited amount of resources that will 
inevitably be available for housing assistance. 
Another question concerns the operations of the proposed 
General Insurance Fund and the Special Risk Insurance Fund. The bill 
does not clarify whether the operations of these revolving funds, 
including the insurance premiums to be charged, are intended to be 
self-supporting either individually or collectively. This question 
obviously has a bearing on the eventual need for appropriated funds, 
authorized by the bill, to cover losses sustained by either one of the 
funds. 
Finally, some questions may be raised with respect to the 
proposal to further liberalize loan-to-value ratios on most unsubsidized 
bome mortgages insured under the revised national housing, particularly 
on higher-priced properties. On a home priced at $30,000 and after 
allowance for the revised treatment of closing costs, for example, the 
downpayment required from the buyer would be reduced to $1,000 from the 
Present level of over $2,000 under the standard Sec. 203 program, and 
the amount of credit needed from private lenders to finance the trans-
ition would be increased by the same amount. On conventional loans the 
downpayment on such a house is one-fourth or more. Given the apparently 
strong underlying demand for housing and the inflationary pressures 
already evident in the construction industry, the additional demand that 
may be stimulated by further liberalization of these mortgage terms 
could add to inflationary pressures and diversion of credit to higher-
Priced homes to the detriment of homebuyers whom the legislation is 
designed to benefit. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon
