Bank of America. A memorandum from the Division of Examinations 
dated April 29, 1968, discussed the proposed merger of The New St. Croix 
Savings Bank, Christians ted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, into Bank 
of America National Trust and Savings Association, San Francisco, 
California. Bank of America had applied to the Board for permission to

convert the two offices of the savings bank into branches of the 
resulting insititution, and the Comptroller of the Currency, in 
connection with his request for a competitive factor report on the 
proposed merger, had asked for the Board's views on the conversion 
of the two offices. 
Submitted with the memorandum were (1) a competitive factor 
report stating, in conclusion, that the merger would have no adverse 
effect on competition, (2) a letter to the Comptroller advising that 
the Board was prepared to permit Bank of America to establish the 
requested branches if the Comptroller approved the proposed merger, 
and (3) a letter to Bank of America, to be sent if the merger was 
approved, granting permission for the establishment of the branches. 
Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal of the competitive 
factor report to the Comptroller, to the letter to the Comptroller 
(copy attached as Item No. 6), and to the letter to be sent to Bank of 
America if the merger was approved. (Note: The letter was sent to 
Bank of America on May 9, 1968; a copy is attached as Item No. 7.) 
Policy record entry. With a memorandum dated May 1, 1968, 
Mr. Broida submitted a draft of policy record entry covering the meeting 
of the Federal Open Market Committee on February 6, 1968. The entry, 
in the same form as approved by the Board on April 22, was now being 
submitted for final review prior to its proposed release on Monday, 
May 6.

The release of the entry was approved unanimously. 
Savings and loan rates. A memorandum dated May 1, 1968, from 
the Legal Division discussed proposals by the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board to modify the savings and loan rate structure. The first proposal 
would permit savings and loan associations to pay a bonus of 1/2 of 1 
per cent on six—month certificate accounts on a quarterly rather than 
a semiannual basis. The second proposal would authorize a new account 
that would compete with the "Golden Passbook" and similar accounts 
offered by banks. The maximum permissible rate of interest would be 
5 per cent, and the minimum maturity period would be 90 days. If funds 
were withdrawn without 90-day prior written notice, no earnings would 
be paid for the period from the last regular distribution date to date 
of withdrawal. The staff recommended that the Board interpose no 
objection to the first proposal but oppose the second. 
There was no discussion of the first proposal. As to the second, 
Governor Robertson observed that the Home Loan Bank Board did not propose 
to include a showing of hardship as a requirement for early withdrawal 
because it would assertedly be necessary to amend Federal charters and 
also the laws of many States. Mr. Sanders had arrived at the conclusion 
set forth in the memorandum, with which he (Governor Robertson) agreed, 
that under the proposal savings and loan associations would be permitted 
to pay 5 per cent on accounts essentially similar to passbook savings 
accounts on which banks could pay only 4 per cent. Accordingly, it 
appeared to him that the Board should explore the matter carefully before 
expressing its views.

In the ensuing discussion, reference was made to sentiment 
expressed recently by some bankers in favor of a higher permissible 
maximum rate on passbook savings, and the staff reviewed the recent 
deterioration in the totals for such accounts. The Chairman requested 
that a memorandum on the subject be prepared for the Board. 
Governor Sherrill suggested that the situation should be 
studied carefully before any action was taken on the passbook rate 
inasmuch as a change in that fundamental rate would have repercussions 
on the whole rate structure. He raised several questions relating 
to the comparability of account privileges at banks and savings and 
loan associations, particularly with respect to the payment of interest 
in certain circumstances, and there appeared to be differences of opinion 
on some points. 
Mr. Sanders noted that the staff was hampered somewhat in its 
interpretation of the Home Loan Bank Board's proposal because the complete 
terms thereof had not yet been made available in writing. 
It was generally agreed that more information was needed on 
several points raised at this meeting, and it was understood that the 
staff would endeavor to provide clarification. 
Salaries at Boston. The Board approved unanimously the payment 
of salary to two officers of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston at the 
respective annual rates fixed by the Bank's Board of Directors. A copy 
of the letter sent to the Bank pursuant to this action is attached as 
Item No. 8. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
authorizes your bank to accept drafts or bills of exchange drawn 
for the purpose of furnishing dollar exchange as required by the 
usages of trade in such countries, dependencies, or insular posses-
sions of the United States as may have been designated by the Board 
of Governors, subject to the provisions of Section 13 of the Fed-
eral Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation C. 
Enclosed is a list of the countries with respect to which 
the Board of Governors has found that the usages of trade require 
the furnishing of dollar exchange. 
The foregoing authorization has been given with the under-
standing that the foreign loans and investments of your bank will 
be made within the guidelines established under the foreign credit 
restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending 
and investment activities of your bank and Wachovia International 
Investment Corporation, and that due consideration is being given 
to the priorities contained therein. Your attention is also di-
rected to the fact that dollar exchange acceptance financing does 
not represent export credit. 
Very truly yours 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to the application filed by you on 
behalf of Mr. Jackson Chambers requesting that the Board of Governors 
institute administrative proceedings pursuant to section 8(b)(1) of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(1)) to determine 
whether The County Trust Company, White Plains, New York, violated 
section 206.5(c)(1) or any other provision of Federal Reserve Regu-
lation F (12 CFR 206) by reason of the financial statements included 
m its 1966 Annual Report to Stockholders and, if so, whether an 
order, pursuant to section 8(b)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act, should be issued against County Trust. 
After consideration of all relevant information, the Board 
of Governors has determined that County Trust has not violated sec-
tion 206.5(c)(1) or any other provision of Regulation F by reason of 
the financial statements included in its 1966 Annual Report to 
Stockholders. 
F o r your guidance and that of interested persons, the following 
brief observations may be pertinent with respect to some of the matters 
in which it is alleged that the financial statements of County Trust 
contained in its 1966 Annual Report to Stockholders are false and mis-
leading or omit material information. 
Reserve for Possible Loan Losses. - The Board does not 
believe that the entry "Transferred per Treasury Tax Formula from 
Earnings" in this schedule (page 9 of the annual report) "implies" 
that the amount so transferred ($4,928) is the maximum amount that 
could be transferred pursuant to the Treasury Tax Formula. To the 
contrary, comparison of this item with the losses actually charged 
off ($376,000, net of recoveries) would suggest that the bank did 
not transfer the maximum amount permitted. 

Davis & Cox 
- 2 -

2. Statement of Changes in Capital Funds. - The "Reserve 
for Contingencies" account represents a segregation of the bank's 
undivided profits and remains a part of stockholder's equity. Amounts 
set aside in such capital account are unrelated to any determinable 
profit or loss element and merely reflect a precautionary allocation 
of accumulated profits for unforeseen developments as judged by manage-
ment. In the Board's opinion, reporting of activity with respect to 
this reserve on a net basis is permitted by section 206.5(c)(1) of 
Regulat ion F, which allows management to "omit details or summarize 
information" if material information necessary to a fair presentation 
is not omitted. 
3. Nonoperating Additions and Deductions. - In the Board's 
opinion, reporting of these items "after tax effect" conforms to accept-
able financial reporting, provided that such items are not affected by 
any unusual tax effects. Since the related tax effects are in this 
case normal, the Board does not believe that material information was 
omitted from the bank's Annual Report to Stockholders by the bank's 
failure to set forth such items "before tax effect". 
4. Determination of Net Operating Earnings. - The Board's 
regulations do not require a bank to furnish an analytical explanation 
of its financial statements in its annual report to stockholders. It 
should be noted, however, that the statement of the bank's operating 
revenue for the year's 1966 and 1965 furnished in the 1966 Annual Report 
to Stockholders indicates that it significantly increased (18 per cent) 
its income from obligations of States and political subdivisions. Elim-
inating such tax exempt income from operating earnings before taxes 
would provide a quick and reasonable explanation for the reduction of 
applicable income taxes and the resultant increase in net operating 
earnings. 
5. Current Market Value of Securities. - The Board's regu-
lations do not require a bank to disclose the "market value" and 
maturities of its securities in its annual report to stockholders, 
unless the difference between market value and carrying value of non-
investment grade securities is material. Nevertheless, it is noted 
that the bank has furnished some information in this regard on page 7 
of its Annual Report to Stockholders. 
Mr. Chambers also requests that the Board, after appropriate 
proceedings, require the bank to (a) give him reasonable access to such 
of the bank's records as will provide information about its condition,

affairs, and operations (b) furnish him with a stockholder's list, and 
Kc) cease and desist from interfering with his rights, and that of 
other stockholders, to obtain information about the affairs of the 
The Board does not believe that it has the power to order 
ne relief, even if warranted, requested in (a) and (c) above as these 
matters involve State and not Federal law. For example, see New York 
yanking Law, Section 6023 (McKinney's Supplement 1967). With respect 
f o r a stockholder's list, it should be noted that sec-

Mr. W. H. Rommel, 
Assistant Director for 
Leg islative Reference, 
Bureau of the Budget, 
Washington, D. C. 20503 
Re: HUD's proposed amendment to the Housing and 
Urban Development Act of 1968 
Dear Mr. Rommel: 
We have your letter of April 17, 1968, requesting a report on 
the above amendment. 
In a report, dated May 8, 1967, to the Subcommittee 
on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate Banking Committee, the Board 
proposed that the sources of funds available for residential mortgage 
investment be broadened, and specifically suggested that more sales of 
participation certificates or other instruments against pools of resi-
dential mortgages be encouraged, subject to appropriate safeguards. 
The amendment now proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development is in accord with the Board's suggestion. 
Since securities guaranteed by GNMA will be backed by the full 
faith and credit of the United States, they will be equal in quality to 
the securities which the sixth sentence of § 5136 (Seventh) of the 
Revised Statutes authorizes national banks to deal in, underwrite, or 
purchase for their own account subject to no statutory limitation on 
amount. Therefore, it is recommended that securities guaranteed by 
GNMA be added to the enumeration in that sentence, by an addition to 
the HUD amendment. This would have the effect of permitting the 
institutions described in the first proviso of § 21(a)(1) of the Bank-
ing Act of 1933 to deal in, purchase and underwrite such securities, 
in addition to (by virtue of the amendment under consideration) issuing 
them. Moreover, it would obviate difficulties in administration which 
would be brought about by having to draw often difficult lines between 
"issuing", "selling", and "underwriting", and would also expand the 
market for such securities. 

Mr. W. H. Rommel 
-2-
The purpose of distinguishing between "investment securities" 
and "securities" in the proposed amendment to § 21(a)(1) of the Banking 
Act of 1933 is not clear to us. It would appear that the result intended 
could be achieved by adding "issuing" to the enumeration of activities 
permitted in regard to "investment securities" in the first proviso. 
The phrase in question would then read: " . . . from dealing in, under-
writing, purchasing, [and] selling, and issuing investment securities 
to the extent . . . ." 
With the foregoing qualifications, the Board is in favor of 
the proposed amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Civil No. 64 C 64 
(ND 111.) 
Your Ref: MR:DAW:HJHeltzer:mer

Dear Mr. Rogovin: 
This acknowledges your letter of April 25, 1968, in which, 
referring to the above-captioned case, you request the Board's 
authorization for the appearance of Mr. Normand Bernard, Special 
Assistant in the Secretary's Office, as an expert witness on behalf 
of the Government. You state that Mr. Bernard will be expected to 
testify as to conditions of the Government securities market in the 
period 1955 through 1962, including market quotations involving specific 
securities. You anticipate that Mr. Bernard will be required to utilize 
in the course of his testimony unpublished statistical data in the 
Board's files relating to the Government securities market. Although 
not stated in your letter, we are advised that you have, at the request 
of Mr. O'Connell of the Board's legal staff, effected issuance of a 
subpoena requiring Mr. Bernard's presence at the trial of this case 
commencing the week of May 6, 1968. 
The Board has authorized Mr. Bernard to appear and testify 
on behalf of the Government upon receipt of and in response to the 
aforementioned subpoena. This authorization contemplates disclosure 
by Mr. Bernard of only such unpublished Board data as you and 
Mr. Bernard mutually determine and agree before trial to be relevant 
to the issues involved in the subject tax refund suit. 

Mr. Mitchell Rogovin 
-2-
Regarding your tender of transportation costs for 
Mr. Bernard, you are advised that the Board will provide Mr. Bernard's 
transportation at its own expense. We will appreciate any action 
on your part calculated to assure Mr. Bernard's return to his duties 
at the Board in the shortest period of time. Should circumstances 
arise prior to the week of May 6, 1968, that suggest to you a delay 
in Mr. Bernard's testimony, we assume that Mr. Bernard's departure 
can be delayed and his appearance placed on an "on-call" basis. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland

Secretary.

Dear Mr. Comptroller: 
This is in reply to your letter of March 25, 
1968, requesting the Board's views regarding the proposed 
conversion of the offices of The New St. Croix Savings 
Bank, Christiansted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, 
into branches of Bank of America National Trust and Savings 
Association ("B of A"), San Francisco, California, partic-
ularly as to any reasons the Board might have for not 
approving the branch conversions. 
The Board has reviewed the application of B of 
A to establish these branches in Christiansted and 
Frederiksted. The Board is prepared to grant permission 
to B of A to establish the requested branches should your 
office approve the proposed merger. It would be appreciated 
if you would advise the Board of your decision on the pro-
posed merger. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal
