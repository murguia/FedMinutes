Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Englewood National Bank 
and Trust Company, Englewood, New Jersey, with The Midland Bank and 
Trust Company, Paramus, New Jersey, under the charter and title of the 
latter was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. The conclusion read as follows: 
Some competition exists between Englewood National 
Bank and Trust Company, Englewood, and The Midland Bank 
and Trust Company, Paramus, because they operate in the 
same banking market. 
However, both banks are relatively 

5/9/68 
- 2 -
small banks in this market and a large number of banking 
alternatives will remain. The overall effect of the pro-
posed merger on competition would be slightly adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Marimac Bank, Scott Township, Pennsylvania, into Keystone 
Bank, Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania, was approved unanimously for trans-
mittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
The conclusion 
read as follows: 
There is no effective competition between Keystone 
Bank, Lower Burrell, and Marimac Bank, Scott Township, 
and the proposed merger would have no adverse competi-
tive effects. 
Foreign banking matters. 
Consideration of an application by 
Fi rst National City Overseas Investment Corporation, New York, New 
York, for permission to acquire up to 50 per cent of the shares of a 
computer service company to be formed in Argentina, at a cost of 
approximately $150,000, generated a discussion, led off by the legal 
staff, regarding the propriety of approving an application by an Edge 
corporation under which control might be exercised of a subsidiary 
engaged in performing services of the kind in question. 
In this 
• 
connection, reference was made to views that had been expressed by the 
Board on various occasions regarding the question whether banks should 
be able to offer computer services domestically. 
There appeared to be 
no particular question with respect to the appropriateness of allowing 
an Edge corporation to acquire a minority interest as an investment in 
3 company engaged in such services in a foreign country, but questions 

1 6 9 5 
5/9/68 
-3-
were raised as to where the line should be drawn in determining the 
distinction between investment and control. 
The points discussed were considered to be of sufficient 
importance to warrant deferring action on the pending application to 
permit further study of the basic issues by the staff. 
Accordingly, 
action on the application was deferred. 
The application next considered was one by First National City 
Overseas Investment Corporation, New York, New York, for permission 
to acquire all of the stock of FNCB Investment Services S.A., to be 
organized in Geneva, Switzerland, at a cost of approximately $18,000. 
The company to be organized would assist the parent bank (First 
National City Bank of New York) and its European branches through 
money brokerage activities and through centralized solicitation of 
trust business and provision of financial advisory services in Europe. 
The D lvision of Examinations recommended denial on the ground that the 
circumstances did not warrant making an exception to the Board's 
current policy of not ordinarily approving equity investments in 
developed countries of continental Western Europe. 
However, the Board noted the small size of the proposed invest-
ment together with the fact that the proposed activities were within 
the compass of those ordinarily performed at foreign branches and 
could be conducted out of the Geneva branch of the parent bank if the 
bank so desired. 
In the circumstances, it was judged that little 
benefit would be derived from turning down the application, and

unanimous approval was given to a letter to the applicant in the form 
attached as Item No. 1. 
The following items were approved unanimously after considera-
tion of background information that had been made available to the

Membership applications. 
Applications made by The Industrial 
Bank of Binghamton, Binghamton, New York, and on behalf of Madison 
State Bank, Madison Township, New Jersey, for membership in the Federal 
Reserve System were approved unanimously. 
Copies of the letters sent 
to the applicants pursuant to the action taken are attached as Items 4 
and 5. 
Memphis Branch. 
Unanimous approval was given to a telegram to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis authorizing the Bank to proceed 
with the preparation of preliminary plans and outline specifications 
for the proposed new Memphis Branch building, it being understood that 
this did not constitute a decision on the propriety of proceeding with 

5/9/68

actual construction according to any particular time schedule. 
A 
copy of the telegram is attached as Item No. 6. 
Coin procedure. 
Unanimous approval was given to the trans-
mittal to the Federal Reserve Banks of correspondence between 
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Wallace and the Board concerning 
guides to be used in determining whether bags of quarters and dimes 
received from circulation should be held for separation or released 
for recirculation. 
Copies of the letter to the Reserve Banks and 
its enclosures are attached under Item No. 7. 
Market-makers in convertible debt securities. 
On February 1, 
1968, the Board had published for comment a proposed amendment to 
Regulation U , Credit by Banks for the Purpose of Purchasing or 
Carrying Registered Stocks, that would have exempted bank loans from 
margin requirements when used to finance the positions of dealer firms 
that make regular over-the-counter markets in debt securities convert-
ible into listed stocks. 
Firms wishing to demonstrate their eligibil-
ity for the proposed exemption were requested to file weekly reports 
showing their gross daily positions and transactions, along with end-
of-day price quotations. 
A memorandum from the Division of Research and Statistics dated 
May 7, 1968, analyzed 
the data provided by eight dealer firms and 
discussed alternatives available to the Board. The alternatives 

I G H S 
5/9/68 
- 6 -
included: (1) adopting the amendment as initially proposed; (2) grant-
ing a general exemption to each of the eight firms on their total 
market-making operations, with no separate certification of eligible 
issues; (3) granting a general exemption to the larger reporting 
dealers on their total market-making operations; (4) granting an 
exemption to all eight firms based on a maximum allowable ratio of 
debt to transactions; or (5) abandoning the proposed exemption. 
There 
was no staff consensus. 
The staff reported that it was now the suggestion of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York that the original proposal be left outstanding 
and that a study be made of the broader aspects of dealer activities 
as market-makers in the securities market generally. 
It was noted 
that such a study would be difficult and time-consuming, and the 
appropriateness of leaving the original proposal outstanding in the 
interim was questioned. 
The staff then summarized the extent to which receipt of the 
reports from the dealer firms, and analysis thereof, had succeeded 
in shedding light on the problem that gave rise to publication of the 
Proposed amendment for comment. 
The staff also described why study 
the reports had resulted in narrowing the range of possibilities 
for Board action. 
It was the consensus that the best course of action at this 
time, on the basis of the available information, would be to abandon 

1 6 9 9 
5/9/68 
- 7 -
the proposed exemption, one Board member noting that this would 
leave it up to the industry, if it so desired, to make a further 
study in support of a position that an exemption would be justified. 
Accordingly, it was agreed unanimously to make an announcement 
that the Board had decided not to adopt the proposed amendment to 
Regulation U , on the basis that a study had not revealed a clear need 
for extending credit on a more favorable basis to dealer firms engaged 
in market-making activities in convertible bonds and that an exemption 
^ > 
would involve undue administrative burdens. 
This position having been decided upon, it was noted that a 
50 per cent margin had been required generally for loans on convertible 
bonds since April 10, 1968, except for bank loans on convertibles made 
on or before March 11, 1968, to those dealer firms that had filed 
reports to establish eligibility for possible exemption. 
It was 
agreed that those latter loans must be brought up to 50 per cent 
margin status by May 10, 1968. 
A copy of the notice published in the Federal Register with 
regard to the Board's decision on the proposed exemption is attached 
a s Item No. 8. A copy of the press release issued is attached as 
Item N o . 9. 
Certificates of deposit. 
Governor Robertson referred to the 
consideration that had been given to amending Regulation Q , Payment 
°f Interest on Deposits, to prevent parties from pooling funds to 
) ( 
;

obtain the higher rate of interest payable on a large-denomination 
certificate of deposit. 
He noted that such regulation would involve 
administrative problems for banks in issuing large-denomination 
certificates and suggested that the views of the Reserve Banks be 
obtained before any further move was made on the matter. 
It was agreed that this procedure should be followed. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
As stated in the Board's press release of February 8, 
1968, it is not the Board s present policy to approve equity 
investments in developed countries of continental Western 
Europe except in unusual circumstances. 
However, due to the minimal amount of dollars involved, 
the Board, in accordance with the request contained in your letter 
of March 5, 1968, grants consent for your Corporation to purchase 
and hold all of the stock of FNCB Investment Services S.A., Geneva, 
Switzerland, at a cost of approximately $18,000, provided the shares 
are acquired within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board has noted that as of March 29, 1968, the foreign 
loans and investments of your Corporation, First National City Bank, 
International Banking Corporation, and First National City Bank 
(International) exceeded the guideline ceiling applicable under the 
foreign credit restraint effort now in effect. The foregoing con-
sent is given with the understanding that steps will be taken to 
reduce those foreign loans and investments to a level consistent 
with the guidelines by the end of June 1968; that the investment 
now being approved will be made within those guidelines; and that 
due consideration is being given to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P . Forrestal

Assistant Secretary.

of March 28, 1968, the Board of Governors grants consent for your 
Corporation to purchase and hold approximately 11,250 shares of

cost of approximately $160,763, provided the shares are acquired 
within one year from the date of this letter. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding 
that the investment now being approved will be made within the 
guidelines established under the foreign credit restraint effort 
now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment 
activities of your Corporation and that due consideration is being 
given to the priorities contained therein.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
authorizes your bank to accept drafts or bills of exchange drawn 
for the purpose of furnishing dollar exchange as required by the 
usages of trade in such countries, dependencies, or insular posses-
sions of the United States as may have been designated by the Board 
of Governors, subject to the provisions of Section 13 of the Fed-
eral Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation C. 
Enclosed is a list of the countries with respect to which 
the Board of Governors has found that the usages of trade require 
the furnishing of dollar exchange. 
In response to the questions raised in your letter of 
February 20, 1968, (1) there are no restrictions as to which foreign 
banks in the specified countries are eligible to receive credit 
facilities for the creation of dollar exchange, and (2) a general 
letter from a particular foreign bank indicating that dollar exchange 
drafts drawn by it will be "for the purpose of furnishing dollar ex-
change as required by the usages of trade in the country" and not 
because dollar exchange is at a premium in the place where drawn 
or for any speculative purpose" may serve as evidence of eligibility 
for discount at a Federal Reserve Bank of drafts drawn by such for-
eign bank. 
Although a member bank need not have a certification to 
this effect from the foreign bank in connection with each draft, it 
i s expected to have sufficient evidence in its files upon which to 
base a conclusion whether the particular draft meets the requirements 
°f Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation C. 

.. 1 7 0 5

Xhus, even where a general letter of intent of the type described 
exists, circumstances surrounding the creation of dollar exchange 
drafts--such as their frequency, amount, and proximity in time to 
such a letter, could suggest that the member bank should make addi-
tional inquiry of the foreign bank with respect to their conformity 
with those requirements. 
In this connection, it should be noted 
that Section 203.2(c)(2) of Regulation C contemplates that dollar 
exchange drafts can and will be liquidated at maturity "through the 
proceeds of export documentary bills or from other sources reasonably 
available to such foreign bank or banker arising in the normal course 
of trade." 
The foregoing authorization has been given with the under-
standing that the foreign loans and investments of your bank will be 
made within the guidelines established under the foreign credit 
restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending 
and investment activities of your bank and Security First International 
Corporation, and that due consideration is being given to the priori-
ties contained therein. 
Your attention is also directed to the fact 
that dollar exchange acceptance financing does not represent export 
credit. 
Very truly yours,

mit any change to be made in the general character 
of its business or in the scope of the corporate

If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's 
charter is made, the bank should advise the Federal Reserve Bank, 
furnishing copies of any documents involved, in order that it may 
be determined whether such change affects in any way the bank's 
status as a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
Acceptance of the conditions of membership contained in 
this letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the 
board of directors after the bank's Certificate of Authority to 
Commence Business has been issued. 
The board of directors should 
also adopt, at the same time, a resolution ratifying the action 
which has been taken in the bank's behalf in making application 
for membership in the Federal Reserve System. A certified copy 
of each resolution should be transmitted to the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. Arrangements will thereupon be made to accept 
payment for an appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock, 
to accept the deposit of the required reserve balance, and to issue 
the appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock to the bank. 
The time within which admission to membership in the 
Federal Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished 
is limited to six months from the date of this letter, unless the 
bank applies to the Board and obtains an extension of time. 
When 
the Board is advised that all of the requirements have been com-
plied with and that the appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank 
stock has been issued to the bank, the Board will forward to the 
bank a formal certificate of membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board of Governors sincerely hopes that you will find 
membership in the System beneficial and your relations with the 
Reserve Bank pleasant.

Dear Mr. Wallace: 
Thank you for your letter of May 6 establish-
ing a procedure for use by the Federal Reserve Banks in 
determining whether bags of quarters and dimes received 
from circulation should be held for separation or 
released for recirculation. 
As you indicated, the new 
procedure should be quite helpful in minimizing the work 
connected with the program for reclaiming silver. 
A 
copy of your letter is being sent to each Federal Reserve 
Bank and Branch. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) Robert C . Holland

Gentlemen: 
At the suggestion of some of the Federal Reserve Banks, and 
with their help, the Mint recently completed a survey of weights of 
mixed quarters and dimes to determine the approximate percentage 
of silver coins in a bag. 
In addition, the Mint lias completed an 
exhaustive study of the total costs of processing mixed coins by the 
Federal Reserve Banks and Mints to determine at what point it would 
not be profitable for the Government to process this coin to reclaim 
the silver. 
These costs, based upon the fluctuating price of silver, 
indicate that when the percentage of silver in a bag of mixed coin is 
two (2) percent or less, there could be very little or no profit realized 
by the government in processing the coin for the silver and it should, 
therefore, be returned to circulation as quickly as possible. 
In view of these studies, and the urgent need to return to cir-
culation clad quarters and dimes, as well as the need to free storage 
space at the Banks and Mints, it is suggested that the following guide 
be used in checking mixed bags of quarters and dimes as they are 
received, to determine if the coin should beheld for separation or 
be recirculated. 
If a $1, 000 bag of mixed dimes or quarters, including the 
weight of the bag and standard tie, weighs 50-1/2 pounds or less, 
it should contain approximately two (2) percent or less of siiver coins 
and could be recirculated. 
If a $500 bag of mixed dimes or quarters, including the bag and 
standard tie, weighs 25-l74 pounds or less, it should contain approxi-
mately two (2) percent or less of silver coins and could be recirculated. 

1 7 1 -.o 
- 2 
This guide should assist the Banks in handling large volumes 
of mixed coin by relieving them of the necessity of storing and pro-
cessing bags of coin which are below the profitable percentage figure 
for reclaiming the silver. 
. 
1 w i s h t o a S a i n ^ank you for your cooperation and participation 
in the com program. 
As we have acknowledged in the past 
it is 
important that the Treasury have the Banks' assistance in completing 
the separation of this coin. 
We are looking forward to returning to 
normal production and distribution of coins now that the coin shortage 
has passed and the transition to clad coins has been completed. 
Sincerely, 
Robert A. Wallace

LOANS BY BANKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING OR 
CARRYING REGISTERED STOCKS 
Creditor Who Makes a Market in Convertible Securities 
By notice of proposed rule making that appeared in the Federal 
Register of February 8, 1968 (33 F.R. 2714), the Board of Governors 
indicated that it was considering amending § 221.2 by adding a new 
paragraph (1) to exempt from margin requirements loans made by banks 
to dealers to finance their market-making activities in convertible 
b ond s. 
The Board has decided not to adopt the proposed amendment. 
This decision followed an analysis of reports that dealer firms engaged 
in such activities filed with the Board following the announcement that 
the Board was considering such an exemption. 
The study did not reveal 
a clear need for extending credit on a more favorable basis to such 
firms and indicated that the exemption would involve undue administrative 
burdens. 
As indicated in a notice of deferred effective date published 
in the Federal Register of April 16, 1968 (33 F.R. 5789), the date by 
which bank loans on convertible securities made after October 20, 1967 
and before March 11, 1968, to those dealer firms that filed reports to 
establish their eligibility for possible exemption was extended from 

April 10, 1968, as specified in § 221.3(r), to May 10, 1968. 
All 
other bank loans on convertible bonds have been and remain subject 
to margin requirements in accordance with the provisions of such 
section. 
As a result of the Board not adopting the proposed amendment, 
no useful purpose would be served by dealers who have not already done 
so filing a registration statement (Form U-3) with the Board, as 
suggested in the notice of proposed rule making. 
Dated at Washington, D. C., the 9th day of May 1968. 
By order of the Board of Governors.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced 
today that it had decided not to adopt an amendment to Regulation U that 
would have exempted from margin requirements loans made by banks to 
dealers to finance their market-making activities in convertible bonds. 
The decision followed an analysis of reports that dealer firms 
engaged in such activities filed with the Board after its announcement 
on February 1, that it was considering such an exemption. 
The study did 
not reveal a clear need for extending credit on a more favorable basis 
to such firms and indicated that the exemption would involve undue 
administrative burdens. 
A 50-per cent margin has been required senerally for loans on 
convertible bonds since April 10 
except for bank loans on convertibles 
made before March 11 to those dealer firms which had filed reports to 
establish eligibility for possible exemption. 
These latter loans now 
must be brought up to the 50-per cent margin status by May 10.

PIEDMONT TRUST BANK 
Notice of Application 
for Exemption from Registration 
Notice is hereby given that Piedmont Trust Bank, 
Martinsville, Virginia, a member State bank of the Federal Reserve 
System, has applied to the Board of Governors, pursuant to sec-
tions 12(h) and 12(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78_1) , for exemption from the registration requirements of 
section 12(g) of said Act. 
In determining whether to grant such exemption, the 
Board is required by section 12(h) to consider whether by reason 
of the number of public investors, amount of trading interest in 
the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of the 
bank, income or assets of the bank, or otherwise, such action will 
be consistent with the public interest and the protection of 
investors. 
Any interested person may, not later than 15 days after 
the publication of this notice in the Federal Register, (i) submit 
written comments and recommendations with respect to the application, 
(ii) request the holding of a hearing on the matter, stating the 
nature of his interest and the reason for such request, or (iii) 
request to be notified if the Board should order a hearing thereon. 

< ( C O 
Such communication should be addressed to the Secretary, Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D . C., 20551. 
At any time after the expiration of said 15 days an order disposing 
of the application may be issued by the Board upon the basis of the 
information stated therein and other available information, unless 
an order for a hearing thereon shall have been issued. 
Dated at Washington, D. C., this 9th day of May, 1968. 
By order of the Board of Governors, acting by its Director

Board of Directors, 
Warren Bank, 
Warren, Michigan. 
Gentlemen: 
The Acting Director of the Division of Examinations, on 
behalf of the Board of Governors under delegated authority, approves 
the establishment of a branch by Warren Bank, Warren, Michigan, at 
22859 Ryan Road, Warren, Michigan, provided the branch is established 
within six months from the date of this letter. 
In approving this application, it has been determined 
that the proposed branch will serve the convenience and needs of the 
community, that establishment of the branch will not tend to create 
an undesirable competitive situation, and that the quality of your 
bank's management is consistent with approval of the branch. 
While the 1968 examination of your bank revealed a fairly 
•high volume of criticized loans and capital substantially less than 
desirable, these were nevertheless significantly improved over the 
1967 examination. 
Continued close attention is needed to improve 
further the quality of the bank's loan portfolio, and all means of 
strengthening your bank's capital position should be considered. 
The bank is enjoying a good growth and in order for such growth to 
be on a sound basis additional capital funds are required. 
Since 
it does not appear that retained earnings are sufficient to increase 
significantly such funds, other means, including sale of new stock, 
would appear necessary. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P . Forrestal 
Robert P . Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.
