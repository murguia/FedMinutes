Consent calendar. 
The Board unanimously approved the applica-
tion of The Fidelity Bank, Rosemont, Pennsylvania, to establish a 
branch in London, England. A copy of the letter sent to the applicant 
is attached as Item No. 1. 
The Board unanimously approved a report, for transmittal to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed acquisition of assets and assumption of liabil-
ity to pay deposits made in The Berwick Bank, Berwick, Pennsylvania, 
by United Penn Bank, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The conclusion read 
as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed acquisition of assets and 
assumption of deposit liabilities of The Berwick Bank by United 
Penn Bank, Wilkes-Barre, would eliminate existing competition 
between them as well as potential for increased competition. 
Overall, the effect of the proposal on competition would be 
adverse. 
Pursuant to recommendations by the Division of Federal Reserve 
Bank Operations in a memorandum dated December 4, 1972, relating to the 
report by the Task Force on Currency Cancellation, Verification and 
Destruction Operations, the Board unanimously approved letters to the 
Federal Reserve Banks, the Chairman of the Conference of Presidents, 
and the Treasury Department. 
Copies of the letters are attached as 
Items 2-4. 
The Board unanimously approved a request of General Financial 
Systems, Riviera Beach, Florida, that its application to retain shares

Credit card liability. The Board had adopted in November 1972 
an amendment to Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, that among other 
things clarified that effective December 15, 1972, all credit cards, 
including those for business use, are covered by the maximum liability 
limit of $50 for unauthorized use. 
In a memorandum of December 13, 

/ » <f -J 
12/14/72 
-5-
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation discussed a request 
by Universal Air Travel Plan for exemption from this liability limita-
tion. The Plan contracted with various airlines, which in turn 
entered into agreements with business subscribers, for issuance of 
credit cards to be used for air travel by the employees of the sub-
scribing businesses. The Plan contended that it would sustain increased 
losses from fraudulent use of the credit cards if the liability limita-
tion applied to its members and their subscribers. The Plan requested 
an exemption from the limitation and intended, if the exemption was 
not granted, to file suit today for a temporary restraining order to 
stay the effective date of the amendment. 
The Division mentioned 
three alternative courses: 
(1) to issue the requested exemption; 
(2) to reject the request for exemption but voluntarily stay the effec-
tive date of the amendments pending outcome of the expected suit; and 
(3) neither to grant the request for an exemption nor to stay the effec-
tive date of the amendment. The Division recommended that the Board 
choose the third alternative and prepare to defend the law suit. A 
rationale in support of that recommendation was set forth in the 
memorandum. 
Discussion indicated a disposition on the part of Governors 
Mitchell and Daane to grant the exemption. They believed that the 
Pre-amendment stance of the Regulation was correct, in which the liabil-
ity limitation was not available to businesses. Moreover, the credit 
card arrangement operated by Universal Air Travel Plan was nearly 

3621 
12/14/72 
-6-
unique; if an exemption was granted, it seemed doubtful that any other 
organization could claim one on similar grounds. 
Other members of the Board having expressed a preference for 
not granting the exemption or staying the effective date of the amend-
ment, it was agreed, Governors Mitchell and Daane dissenting, that 
Universal Air Travel Plan would be informally apprised that its request 
was denied. 
NOW accounts. The Board had had several discussions, most 
recently on December 12, 1972, of the implications of the recently-
instituted practice of mutual savings banks in Massachusetts of permit-
ting the use of negotiable orders of withdrawal (NOW's) from interest-
bearing savings accounts. The Massachusetts and New Hampshire Bankers 
Associations had petitioned the Federal and State authorities for 
relief from the competitive impacts of this development. Among possible 
measures the Board had discussed were (1) increasing the interest rate 
ceiling on savings deposits at member Massachusetts banks to 4-3/4 per 
cent; (2) treating NOW's as noncash items; (3) proposing to permit 
paperless transfers by a customer from his savings account to his 
demand deposit account at the same bank, and permitting in-bank paper-
less transfers from a savings account of a depositor to a business 
demand deposit account held by the same bank in payment of bills; and 
(M holding a hearing to consider the issues. 
In a memorandum of December 13, 1972, the Legal Division reported 
°n the tenor of discussion of the NOW account problem at a meeting of 

3622 
12/14/72 
-7-
the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Bank Regulation attended 
by representatives of the Federal bank supervisors, the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board, President Morris of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston, and Mrs. Freyda Koplow, the Massachusetts Bank Commissioner. 
Mrs. Koplow had reviewed the ramifications of the problem and indicated 
that she had offered the following compromise proposal to the associa-
tions of Massachusetts savings bankers and commercial bankers: 
(1) Demand deposit powers would be given to savings banks, 
and such deposits (which would not bear interest) would be sub-
ject to the reserve requirements that apply to demand deposits 
of Massachusetts-chartered nonmember commercial banks. 
Equality 
would be achieved with respect to such accounts in other areas, 
such as taxation. 
No reserve requirements would be imposed on 
savings accounts at savings banks. 
(2) Savings bankers and commercial bankers would join 
together to ask the State legislature to abolish NOW accounts. 
(3) The rate on passbook savings deposit accounts at 
Massachusetts commercial banks would be raised from 4-1/2 per 
cent to 4-3/4 per cent, thus establishing the 50 basis point 
differential between commercial banks and savings banks with 
respect to such accounts that exists in the other States. 
The two groups of bankers had accepted the proposal, although the 
savings bankers had expressed a hope that a "grandfather" provision 
would be adopted permitting holders of NOW accounts to retain them. 
M rs. Koplow's next step would be to try to enlist support for the 
Proposal from a special study commission that had been set up in 
Massachusetts to consider proposed legislation that would grant 
conventional demand deposit powers to savings banks. She requested 

3623 
12/14/72 
-8-
that the Board withhold action on any of the measures it was consid-
ering until January 1973, and possibly February 1973, in order to 
provide time for her efforts to obtain the commission's support for 
the compromise proposal and to present the proposal to the Massachusetts 
leg 
islature. 
She recognized that the compromise proposal represented 
only a temporary solution, but advocated its adoption because time 
was needed to study the issues. Governor Mitchell had cautioned that 
n o statement should be made suggesting that the Board was opposed to 
NOW accounts, and expressed his own view that the banking authorities 
should be moving in the direction of permitting in-bank paperless 
third party payment transfers involving interest-bearing savings accounts. 
At today's meeting Governor Mitchell expressed the view that 
the Board should accede to Commissioner Koplow's request that the matter 
he held in abeyance until early in 1973. There was unanimous agreement 
uPon such deferral. 
Foreign joint ventures. Today's agenda called for consideration 
a staff proposal in a memorandum of October 31, 1972, for definition 
Board policy on the participation of U.S. banks in foreign joint 
ventures, as well as three specific applications that the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation had presented in memoranda dated December 12, 
1972, and cited as illustrating the problems encountered in foreign 
investments in nonfinancial businesses by Edge corporations and bank 
holding companies. 

3624 
12/14/72 
-9-
Discussion included an observation that the question of foreign 
joint ventures was only one aspect of the over-all issue of foreign 
operations by U.S. banks, and it seemed premature to adopt a policy 
regarding that aspect when work was in progress looking toward conclu-
sions with respect to the larger issue. 
There was unanimous agreement that action be deferred on both 
the policy question and the specific cases. 
First National City Corporation. 
Today's agenda called for 
consideration of applications by First National City Corporation, New 
York, New York, to acquire shares of (1) Citibank (Central), National 
Association, Oriskany Falls, New York (the successor by merger to The 
First Trust and Deposit Company of Oriskany Falls), and (2) the successor 
by merger to Central Valley National Bank, Central Valley, New York. 
Ihe Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of the 
applications in memoranda of November 14 and December 5, 1972, respec-
tively, as did the Banking Markets Section. 
In a memorandum of October 30, 1972, the Banking Markets Section 
and the Division of Supervision and Regulation reported on a review 
they had made, at the request of the Board, of the grandfather nonbank-
1ng activities of First National City Corporation. 
Orders approving 
several bank acquisitions by the corporation since December 1970 had 
contained language intended to hold open the Board's options with 
regard to the nonbanking activities. All of the activities were of 

3625 
12/14/72 
-10-
the 10-year class, that is, they must be divested by January 1, 1981, 
unless the Board approved continuation beyond that date. The review 
had been conducted on the basis of the Board's conclusion that, with 
respect to 10-year activities, divestiture earlier than January 1, 
1981, would be required only if acquisition of an additional bank 
would increase any adverse situations found to exist with respect to 
a nonbanking activity. 
The staff's conclusion from the review was that there were no 
serious adverse competitive or other public interest considerations 
involving the nonbanking activities of First National City Corporation 
and the commercial banks it had acquired since December 1970, or the 
banks it was now seeking to acquire. Ownership of Cresap, McCormick & 
Paget, a general management consulting firm, was marginally objectionable 
because of the possibility of unfair competition, but there was no 
evidence of actual abuse that could support an order for early divesti-
ture. The staff recommended that no modification be required in the 
Corporation's 10-year grandfather authority for its domestic, nonbanking 
activities in connection with its acquisitions of banks approved by 
the Board since December 1970 or the two applications now before the 
Board. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that under the rule the 
fioard had chosen with respect to 10-year grandfather activities, the 

362G 
12/14/72 
-11-
two proposed bank acquisitions must be approved. However, he did not 
think the rule was a good one. He believed that the correct position 
W as the one the Legal Division had recommended, in which divestiture 
a nonbanking activity might be made a condition to approval of 
acquiring an additional bank even if the acquisition did not worsen 
the adverse aspects found with respect to the nonbanking activity. 
The latter rule, unlike the one the Board had chosen, would avoid 
giving a new multi-bank holding company an advantage over other bank 
holding companies through continuation of nonbanking activities that 
were not permissible for bank holding companies in general. 
Governor Brimmer said he would vote to disapprove both of the 
Proposed acquisitions. 
In his view, the kind of review of grandfather 
activities that had been made failed to highlight the real issue. He 
did not believe that First National City Corporation should be allowed 
t o Pick up moderate-sized banks throughout New York State, as it had 
done, and yet continue until 1981 to operate a management consulting 
business, which the Board had ruled impermissible for bank holding 
companies. He thought that the rule that had been adopted--that 
divestiture would not be required unless a new bank acquisition compounded 
adverse aspects of a nonbanking activity--represented a fundamental 
e r r o r . 
After further discussion the applications of First National 
City Corporation with respect to the Oriskany Falls and Central Valley 

3627 
12/14/72 
-12-
banks were approved, Governor Brimmer dissenting. 
It was understood 
that implementing documents would be prepared for the Board's consid-
eration. 
Grandfather privileges. 
On November 28, 1972, the Board 
had decided not to require termination of the grandfather privileges 
under the Bank Holding Company Act of Delta Loan & Finance Company, 
S t. Louis, Missouri. With a memorandum of December 8, 1972, the 
Legal Division submitted a proposed determination to carry out that 
decision and recommended that it be used as a model in the preparation 
°f additional determinations. 
The Division suggested several alterna-
tive procedures to expedite handling of the large number of determina-
tions to be issued in the next few weeks, and recommended one in which, 
after review and decision by the Board on termination of grandfather 
Privileges, a determination reflecting the decision, if approved by 
the General Counsel and the Program Director for Banking Structure, 
would be released without further Board action unless (a) a Board 
member specifically requested that the determination be put on the 
Board's agenda or (b) further consideration by the Board was considered 
advisable by the staff. 
The recommended procedure was approved unanimously. The deter-
mination with respect to Delta Loan & Finance Company was also approved 
unanimously in a form reflecting a suggestion for a change in language. 

3628

A copy of the determination, in the form in which it was subsequently 
issued, is attached as Item No. 14. 
Grandfather privileges. 
Pursuant to the recommendation of 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets 
lection in a memorandum of December 1, 1972, the Board agreed that 
n o termination should be required in the permanent grandfather 
authority under the Bank Holding Company Act regarding the nonbanking 
activities of The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Flint, Michigan, 
and authorized issuance of a determination to that effect. A copy 
°f the determination subsequently issued is attached as Item No. 15. 
Report on competitive factors. After brief discussion the 
Board deferred action on a report to the Comptroller of the Currency 
the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger into Puget 
Sound National Bank, Tacoma, Washington, of (1) Eatonville State Bank, 
Eatonville, (2) State Bank of Morton, Morton, and (3) Orting State 
Bank, Orting, all in Washington. 
All staff members except Messrs. Melnicoff and Smith then 
withdrew. and Mr, Burke, Director, Division of Personnel Administration, 
entered the meeting. 
Officer appointments. 
The following reassignments and title 
changes regarding members of the staff were agreed upon in principle. 
It- was understood, however, that these changes would become effective 

3629 
12/14/72 
-14-
at dates suitable from an administrative standpoint and with account 
being taken of the recent Executive Order of the President regarding 
Promotions. 
No changes in salaries were recommended, on the under-
standing that compensation of the aforementioned staff would be reviewed 
with the other official staff at the end of the year and recommendations 
made as appropriate at that time. 
1. Reassignment of Joseph E. Kelleher from Director, 
Division of Administrative Services, to Assistant 
to the Board. 
2. The promotion of Walter W. Kreimann from Deputy 
Director, Division of Administrative Services, to 
Director. 
3. A change in title of Joseph R. Coyne from Special 
Assistant to the Board to Assistant to the Board. 
The proposal to appoint Bernard Norwood to official staff 
Position of Adviser in the Division of International Finance was 
^ferred. 
Messrs. Smith and Burke then withdrew. 
The Chairman reviewed the outlook for the Committee on Interest 
and Dividends with the Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.

AODR1SS •FFICI"A,_ CORRESPDNOtNCE 
TO THE BOARD 
December 15, 1972 
The Board has reviewed the coriments of the Reserve Banks, 
the Conference of First Vice. Presidents, and the Conference of General 
Audi. tors on the proposals contained in the Task Force Report of 
May 183 1972, and has taken the following actions: 
A. ADOPTED AS SYSTEM POLICY. THAT: 
3. Continuous closed circuit TV. with video taping, be used 
in appropriate areas within, the currency cancellation, verification 
and destruction operations. Also, the visual monitoring of the 
screen(s) be done on a random basis by operating management, and 
the tape records be retained in a secured area subject to review by 
the audit staff. 
2. Guard Force Personnel be trained in the basic control rules 
and be given general responsibility for reporting any apparent exceptions 
to their supervisors. 
3. Packages, briefcases, handbags, etc., be generally excluded 
fro;u secure areas where valuables arc exposed, or if exceptional circum-
stances require their entry, inspection be required. Also. Reserve 
Banks provide appropriate storage for personal items, and when it is 
available, n.o personal containers such as packages, briefcases, handbags, 
etc.a be allowed at work stations in the cancellation, verification 
and destruction operations. Reserve Banks consider applying this rule 
to 
O U K O : secured areas. 

-2-
3632 
4. Present verification percentages be continued as a minimum 
requirement, to be increased from time to time at the option of the 
Reserve Banks, the Treasury, or the Board of Governors, with the 
understanding that any such request for increases from the Treasury 
°r the Board of Governors will be made and coordinated in the light 
°f operations at the Reserve Banks affected. 
5. Utmost care be exercised in the selection of personnel for 
sensitive positions. Due consideration be given to the degree of 
sensitivity, responsibility and accountability of an operation in 
the determination of salary and grade levels, 
6. All applicants for. and employees in sensitive positions, 
b e required to sign a release statement-to allow a background investi-
gation. New applicants for sensitive positions and present employees 
transferring to such positions should be required to sign releases 
Prior to appointment. 
Employees already in sensitive positions i.'iay, 
^t local option, be brought under the requirement in equal annual 
lncre«!'ents over a three-year period. 
If an employee presently 
csigned to a sensitive, position refuses to sign a release statement, 
if** 
•L is suggested that he be given the option of transferring to a 
non-sensitive position or leaving the Bank. 
7. Applicants being seriously considered for or actively 
tiTlployed in sensitive positions be checked for arrest/conviction 
records through the FBI and, if possible, State and local police. 
Applicants bei.re; seriously considered for or actively 
employed in sensitive positions undergo background investigations 
g'1^ credit checks conducted bv private investigative services. 
, 1 investigations are to include previous employment, credit 
lt,C!':3 military experience and type of discharge, and character 
^eighi,0rhood check). 
9. Background investigations, arrest/conviction record checks 
a n J 
credit checks be updated every three years.

c s e r i o u s problem of drug abuse by employees. 

3-
3633 
12. Each Reserve Bank adopt and promulgate to its staff a state-
ment of policy governing its approach to drug related problems. Such 
a staten-ent should make it clear that unauthorized possession, sale, 
transfer, or use of illegal drugs by an employee is cause for dismissal. 
rocedures should also be provided defining the responsibilities of 
managers and supervisors in detection and handling of drug related 
Problems. 
13. Each Reserve Bank institute a general program designed to 
acquaint employees with the dangers of drug abuse and the community 
resources available to cope with drugs and drug problems.

ar.d the procedures to be followed in handling employee problems 
^ i c h may be drug related. 
15. Each Reserve Bank undertake measures to identify drug 
llsers among applicants and members of the staff. Pre-employment and 
subsequent physical examinations should include special attention to 
euical symptoms of drug abuse. Also, that urinalysis be included as 
of examination. 
16. Reserve Banks not release to mass media the names or 
Photographs of employees in currency verification and destruction 
tions. 
17. Public tours of Reserve Banks not include visits to currency 
V e ri fixation and destruction areas, and that they be restricted in 
°trier areas where adequate protection of valuables is not possible. 
B- 
RECOMMENDED TG THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT, THAT:

DEFERRED, PENDING FURTHER STUDY 
1. The Task Force proposal that currency verification and 
destruction be conducted off premise is deferred pending further 
study. The Board intends to engage a consulting firm to make this 
study. 
2. The Subcommittee on Personnel proposal that the Reserve Banks 
consider the merits of programs providing employment, with appropriate 
safeguards, for rehabilitated drug users, has been referred to the 
Conference of Presidents for further study. 
The proposals Adopted As System Policy are effective immediately 
arid should be implemented at the earliest possible date; the Board 
appreciate being advised of the estimated date of implementation.

Dear Mr. Kimbrel: 
In a report dated May 26, 1972, the Subcommittee on 
^rsonnel made several recommendations on the subject of drug 
Usa£e. 
I'he. Conference approved the recommendations, at its 
Cia^ting on June 19, 1972, with the understanding that implemen-
tation. will be at the discretion cf each Reserve Bank. 
The Board's staff has reviewed the Subcommittee's 
report and the recommendations contained therein, and is of 
view that it would be desirable for an appropriate committee 
o f the Conference to review further the recommendation that: 
"the Reserve Banks consider the merits of 
programs providing employment, with appropriate 
safeguards, for rehabilitating drug users." 
The Board has taken further action with respect to 
other recommendations contained in the Subcommittee's report 
l u its letter (S-2223) dated December 15, 1972. 
Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Carlock: 
The Federal Reserve Board and the Banks have recently 
analyzed the controls cn Currency Verification and Destruction 
operations at the Federal Reserve Banks. The Board is of the 
opinion that certain changes will enhance the security and effi-
ciency of these operations, and it recognizes that certain pro-
posed steps will reouire either joint action or separate Treasury 
action. Accordingly, the Board requests that the Treasury give 
consideration to the following natters: 
1. Revision of Treasury regulations to provide that 
currency cancelled as described in the Report of 
the Task Force on Currency Cancellation, Verifica-
tion, and Destruction Operations, dated May IS, 
1972, has no value as legal tender. The Board's 
proposed procedural changes rely heavily on the 
rulins by the Treasury General Counsel on May 15, 
19/2 to this effect. 
2. The Board reouests that present currency destruc-
tion certificates (Form TUS 9000) be serially 
numbered. 
3. The Board suggests that the Treasury Department 
maintain a file of specimen signatures of Federal 
Reserve Bank officers who are authorized to sign 
destruction certificates so that signatures on 
completed certificates may be compared to the 
specimen. 
A. The Board recognizes the desirability of distrib-
uting cancellation information to financial insti-
tutions when new procedures are implemented, ana 

Hr. John K. Carlock

suggests that joint consideration be given to 
the matter. 
The Board designates its Division of Federal xReserve 
Bank Operations as its representative in these matters.

Dear Mr. Thomas: 
This is in response to your letter of November 22, 1972, to 
/ir« Donald Kline of the Board's staff, in which you request that your 
Company's section 3(a)(3) application to retain shares of Tri-City Bank, 
p3lm Beach Gardens, Florida, be temporarily withdrawn from Board considera-
tion and held in abeyance. You also request that General Financial Systems 
r-ot b e required to divest its shares of Tri-City Bank for a period of at

Application to retain shares of Tri-City Bank. 
The Board does not object to your company withdrawing the subject 
Application and subsequently resubmitting the application for Board consid-
eration. However, since substantial financial and other information will 
have to be updated at the time of resubmission of the application, the 
"Application (including copies) is being returned to you for appropriate 
amendnie.nt at the time of resubmission. 
Your company's request that it not be required to divest Tri-City 
ank for a period of at least 120 days, pending amendment and resubmission 
the application, is granted on the condition that an amended application 
7 U l be submitted to the Board no later than March 22, 1973.

FIDELITY AMERICAN BANKSHARES, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank, 
Mortgage Company, and Finance Company 
Fidelity American Bankshares, Inc., Lynchburg, Virginia, a bank 
folding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
aPPlied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
•l842(a)(3)) to acquire voting shares of Citizens Bank and Trust Company of 
Charlottesville, Charlottesville, Virginia 
("Bank"), through the acquisition 
0 f 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of Citizens Commonwealth 
CorPoration 
("Citizens Corporation"), a one-bank holding company owning 
a U of the shares of Bank. 
Applicant has also applied for the Board's approval, under 
§ A<c>(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and § 225.4(b)(2) of the 
B ° a r ^ s Regulation Y, for permission to acquire shares of Citizens Mortgage 
CorPoration, Charlottesville, Virginia ("Citizens Mortgage") and Blue 
Finance Corporation, Crozet, Virginia, ("Blue Ridge"), both of which 
a r e ^ s o wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citizens Corporation. Citizens Mortgage

C o ^ r c i a l loans and of servicing such loans for itself and other institu-

S t a n c e . 
Finance Company engages in such commercial finance activities 
a S *** authorized under the Virginia Small Loan Act, and in the sale of 
**Xated credit life and credit accident and health insurance. The types of 
C i t i e s that Citizens Mortgage engages in or .proposes to.engage in and that 
*ldge e n g a g e s i n h a v e b e e n determined by the Board to be closely related 
to t h e business of banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)).

•2-
Notice of receipt of the applications has been given in accordance 
w i th §§ 3 and 4 of the Act, and the time for filing comments and views has 
®*Pired. The Board has considered the applications and all comments 
R e i v e d in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
I842(c)), and the considerations specified in § 4(c)(8) of the Act. 
Applicant, the eighth largest banking organization in Virginia, 
c°ntrols 11 banks with aggregate deposits of $423.0 million representing 
4 , 6 Per cent of deposits of commercial banks in Virginia.- 
Acquisition of 
(deposits of $36.8 million) would increase Applicant's share of 
dePosits in the State by 0.4 percentage points and would not alter its 
taking i n the State nor result in a significant increase in the concentration 
o f hanking resources in Virginia. 
Bank operates its main office and four branch offices in the city 
°f Charlottesville, Bank is one of four banking organizations serving 
CWlottesville and, as of June 30, 1970, ranked as the third largest of 
th* four banking organizations in the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle 
C°Ul*y (which approximates the relevant banking market) with 17.0 per cent 
commercial bank deposits in the market. The closest offices of any of 
^Plicant•s banking subsidiaries and Bank are 45 miles apart, and 
Automation of the proposal would not eliminate any existing competition 
Bank and any of Applicant's banking subsidiaries. Further, it 
unlikely that significant future competition between Bank and

holding company formations and acquisitions approved by the 
r°uSh October 31, 1972.

^PPllcant's present subsidiaries would be eliminated by consummation of 
Proposal in the light of the distances separating Applicant's subsidi-
s e s and Bank, and Virginia's restrictive branching laws. While Applicant 
c°uld enter the market by establishing a cle novo bank, the market area's 
P°pulation% economic growth, and number of banking offices as well as other 
fctcts of record, indicate that the market is not particularly attractive 
f 
r ie novo entry. Affiliation with Applicant may stimulate competition 
b y making it easier for Bank to expand the range of its services. Thus, 
C0Kipetitive considerations appear to be consistent with approval of the 
aPPlication. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its 
Subsidiary banks, and Bank are regarded as generally satisfactory."^ 
^though new services will not be introduced into the market, Bank's 
affiliation with Applicant will assist Bank in making available services 
ank does not presently offer such as automatic payroll preparation and other 
C 0 m 
Puter services, and accounts receivable^financing. Accordingly, considera-
t i o n s related to the convenience and needs of the communities to be served are 
distent with and lend some support to approval of the application. 
It l a the Board's judgment that the proposed acquisition of Bank would 
be j 
n the public interest and the application should be approved. 
Citizens Mortgage was organized by Citizens Corporation in 1969 
n e Purpose of making real estate loans and servicing such loans for 
B o ard Order of October 18, 1972 approving the applications of Fidelity 
VirRi 
Bankshares, Inc. to acquire Citizefis National Bank of llerndon, Kerdon, 
Vlr8inia a n d F a i r f i e l d National Bank of Highland Springs, Highland Springs, 

3642 
-4-
itself and other institutional lenders and has its sole office in 
Charlottesville. As of May 31, 1972, it had only six loans totalling 
Approximately $50,000 outstanding. Citizens Mortgage does not compete 
w U h any of Applicant's subsidiaries, nor is it a significant competitor 
the Charlottesville area. Considering the mortgage company's current 
l€*el of operations, its acquisition by Applicant is akin to de novo 
entry by Applicant. Affiliation with Applicant would provide Citizens 
Mortgage with a source of additional capital funds to expand its operations, 
Particularly in the area of second mortgage loans. It does not appear 
th*t any existing or potential competition would be eliminated by consummation 
o f the present proposal, nor is there any evidence in the record indicating 
th*t consummation of the proposal would result in any undue concentration 
o f resources, unfair competition, conflicts of interest, unsound banking 
Practices, or other adverse effects upon the public interest. 
Blue Ridge, was organized in 1968 by a group of local investors, 
Eluding certain officers and directors of Citizens Corporation, and was 
acQuired by Citizens Corporation on January 1, 1970. Blue Ridge operates 
main office in Crozet, Virginia and has a branch office in Charlottesville. 
X t ranks as the seventh largest of nine consumer finance companies operating 
l n the city of Charlottesville and Albermarle County. It had $368 thousand 
°f outstanding loans representing 7.6 per cent of the loans of consumer 
fl*ance companies in the above described area, as of December 31, 1971. 
Ridge also engages in the sale of credit life and credit accident and 

3643 
-5-
health insurance directly related to its extensions of credit. No affiliate 
of applicant operates in Blue Ridge's market area and approval of the present 
Proposal will not eliminate any existing competition between Applicants 
Subsidiaries, or Bank, and Blue Ridge, nor does it appear likely that 
si8nificant future competition would be foreclosed by approval of the 
Present proposal. There is no evidence in the record indicating that 
Consummation of the proposal would result in any undue concentration of 
r^sources, unfair competition, conflicts of interest, unsound banking 
Practices, or other adverse effects upon the public interest. Moreover, 
filiation with Applicant would provide Blue Ridge with increased access 
to capital funds and thus increase Blue Ridge's capacity to meet the 
p u b U c demands for this type of credit. Based upon the foregoing, and 
0ther considerations in the record, the Board has determined that the 
p u b U c interest factors that it is required to consider regarding the 
Proposed acquisition of Citizens Mortgage and of Blue Ridge are favorable 
that the applications should be approved. 
Citizens Corporation directly and indirectly holds title or 
to property occupied by Bank together with certain other properties 
*hich are designated for future expansion of banking or related activities 
°f citi2ens Corporation's subsidiaries. It appears that the size of these 
h o^ing s is somewhat larger than would be needed by Citizens Corporation 
atld its subsidiaries in the foreseeable future. In this connection, Applicant 
h a s committed itself to the disposal of one of the two parcels of real 
*State held for future expansion by Citizens Corporation in proximity to 
Citizens Corporation's headquarters within one yehr from the date of this 
^Proval.

On the basis of the record, the applications to acquire Bank, 
Citi2o.ns Mortgage, and Blue Ridge are approved for the reasons summarized 
above. The acquisition of Bank shall not be consummated (a) before the 
thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order or (b) 
later than three months after the effective date of this Order, unless 
such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Richmond pursuant to delegated authority. The determinations,

f°l'th in section 225.4(c) of Regulation Y and to the Board's authority 
t o require such modification or termination of the activities of a holding 
company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure 
ConiPliance with the provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's 
and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasion tnereo .

COMMERCE BANCSHARES, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) 
t o acquire more than 80 per cent of the voting shares of Lexington Bank 
and Trust Company, Lexington, Missouri. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
n°ne has been timely received. The Board has considered the application 
in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant has twenty-two subsidiary banks with total deposits 
o f $988.4 million, representing 7.9 per cent of total commercial bank 
deposits in Missouri, and is the third largest bank holding company and 
banking organization in the State. ( A H banking data are as of June 30, 1972", 
adjusted to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved by 
^ e Board through November 30, 1972.) The acquisition of Bank ($7.5 million 
dePosits) would increase Applicant's share of the State's total deposits by 
'06 per cent, and Applicant would become the second largest banking organi-
2ation in Missouri. Consummation of the acquisition would not result in a 
slgnificant increase in the concentration of banking resources in the State. 
Bank, the smaller of two banks in Lexington and the fifth largest 
o f eleven banks competing in the relevant market area which includes the 
s°utheast portion of Ray County and the northwest and north central portion 

3646 
-2-
°f Lafayette County, holds 11.42 per cent of market deposits» 
Applicant's 
closest subsidiary banking office is located in a separate market area, 
approximately twenty-three miles northwest of Lexington. There is no 
meaningful present competition between any of Applicant's subsidiary banks 
and Bank. Furthermore, it appears unlikely that any significant competition 
would develop between any of Applicant's subsidiaries and Bank in the 
future due to the distances separating the banking offices, Missouri's 
restrictive branching law, and the presence of numerous banking alternatives 
the intervening areas. The Board concludes that consummation of the 
Proposal would not eliminate existing or potential competition, nor would 
have adverse effects on any competing bank. 
Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources 
ai*d future prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary banks, and Bank are 
satisfactory and consistent with approval of the application. While it 
Appears that major banking needs in the area are being met, considerations 
rAlating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be served lend 
some weight toward approval of the application in view of the fact that 
S° m e specialized banking services will become available locally. It is 
the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
^terest, and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) 
b e f o r e the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order

°Perating history. However, as subsidiaries of Applicant, their prospects 
appear favorable. Banking factors are consistent with approval of these 
applications. There are presently no banks operating in the immediate 
a r e a to be served by Lakeside Bank. Although at least one other newly-
chartered bank will be operating in that area in the near future, the 
raPid growth in this area indicates the need for additional banking 
alternatives. Establishment of Westwood Bank will provide residents of 
^at bank's service area a convenient source of the wide variety of banking 
advices offered through Applicant. Considerations relating to the 
c°ttvenience and needs of the residents of the areas proposed to be served 
ky Lakeside and Westwood banks are consistent with approval of these 
applications. 
It is the Board's judgment that the proposed acquisitions would 
in the public interest and that the applications should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications are approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The transactions shall not be consummated (a) 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this 
0l?der or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this

FIRST NATIONAL CITY CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Acceptance Finance Company, 
Three Affiliated Corporations and an Affiliated Partnership 
First National City Corporation, New York, New York, a bank 
M d i n g company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
aPplied for the Board's approval under § 4(c)(8) of the Act and 
§ 
.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y to acquire all of the voting 
shares of Acceptance Finance Company, Clayton, Missouri ("Acceptance") 
a n d to indirectly acquire through that acquisition: 
(1) the Samuel 
^°rgan Corporation ("Samuel"), (2) the Anna Morgan Corporation ("Anna"), 
9 n d (3) Financial Forms, Inc. ("Forms"), all Missouri corporations, and 
t h e assets of Daniel Charles Agency ("Agency"), a Missouri partnership.JV 
^Cceptance engages in the activities of (1) making personal loans to 
(2) purchasing of consumer installment paper, and (3) 
acting as agent for the sale of credit life, accident, health, property 
a n d casualty insurance in connection with its own extensions of credit. 
A§snCy acts as an agent for the sale of property and casualty insurance, 
cctly related to the extension of credit by Acceptance. Such 
have been determined by the Board to be closely related to 
e W i n e s s of banking. 
(12 CFR 295.4(a)(1) and (9)) Samuel and 
has filed a separate application to acquire Gateway Life 
S u b
U^nce Company, a wholly owned credit life insurance underwriting 
salary of Acceptance, which application will be tb© subject of separate 
^deration by the Board. 

_ 3655 
-2-
Anna will confine their activities to premises holding for Acceptance 
at*d its subsidiaries and Forms will confine its activities to the printing 
forms used in Acccptance's business. Such activities are permissible 
a s incidental to activities determined by the Board to be closely 
Elated to banking. 
Notice of the application affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views on the public interest factors has 
keen duly published (37 Federal Register 19402). The time for filing 
comments and views has expired and none have been timely received. 
Applicant controls five banks, with aggregate deposits of 
aPproximately $13.83 billion representing 14.7 per cent of the total 
commercial bank deposits in New York.!/ Applicant also has nonbanking 
Subsidiaries engaged principally in mortgage banking, lease and 
conditional sales financing, but no present consumer finance subsidiaries. 
Acceptance has total assets of $31 million and operates 85 
8 m a U loan offices in 14 States throughout the South, the Mid-West, 
an<* the Far West. The closest office of Applicant's banking subsid-
iaries to offices of Acceptance is over 800 miles distant. Since 
^Pically small personal loans tend to be of a local nature and service, 
'-here is no existing competition between Acceptance and Applicant in 
«*« product line. Nor would consummation of the transaction appear 
t o have any significantly adverse effects on potential competition. 
T he barriers to entry for the small personal loan business do not 
banking and consumer loan data are as of December 31, 1971, 
^Justed to reflect bank holding company acquisitions approved by the 
° a rd through September 15, 1972. 

3656

appear to be particularly high in most States, capital requirements 
are low and there are no significant economies of scale. Moreover, 
Applicant appears to be only one of numerous potential entrants into 
fche small loan business so that following consummation of the proposal 
there would remain numerous companies with the ability and incentive 
t o enter each of the local small loan markets. Acceptance does not 
aPpear to have a dominant position in any of the various local markets 
ln which it has small loan offices. Rather it appears that its market 
®hare with only a few minor exceptions is rather small and that the 
accluisition of Acceptance by Applicant can be characterized as a 
"foothold" acquisition in the great majority of local markets. 
Acceptance on its own and through its affiliated partner-
8hiP agency acts as agent for the sale of credit-related insurance. 
However, it does not seem to be a significant factor in this product 
in any of the areas it operates, nor does Applicant have any 
8ubsidiary operating as an agent for credit-related insurance. For 
these reasons it does not appear that acquisition of Acceptance and 
Agency by Applicant would have a significantly adverse effect on either 
listing or potential competition. 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that consummation 
the proposal would result in any undue concentration of resources, 
Unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. 
APproval of the application, by giving Acceptance access to Applicant's 
fit*ancial resources, should enhance its competitive effectiveness and 
enable it to expand the range of services it offers. 

_ 3657 
-4-
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations reflected 
in the record, the Board has determined that consummation of the 
Proposal herein can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the 
Public that outweigh possible adverse effects. 
Accordingly, the application is hereby approved. This 
determination is subject to the conditions set forth in § 225.4(c) 
°f Regulation Y and the Board's authority to require such modification 
° r termination of the activities of a holding company or any of its 
8ubsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure compliance with the 
Previsions and purposes of the Act and the Board's regulations and 
°rders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasion thereof.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
This acquisition represents the acquisition by the second 
la*gest banking organization in the United States of a substantial 
consumer finance concern with 85 offices located in 14 States and 
assets of over $30 million. 
In § 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, Congress 
Provided that the Board may differentiate between activities commenced 
•it novo and activities commenced by the acquisition in whole or in part 
o f 3 going concern. The legislative history makes clear Congress' 
Preference for de novo entry. The United States Supreme Court has 
S a i d, "corporate growth by internal expansion is socially preferable 
t o expansion by acquisition." United States v. Philadelphia National 
374 U. S. 321, 370 (1963). Such a preference is clearly warranted, 
parUcularly in a situation such as the instant case where Applicant 
1)98 the financial resources and expertise to enter de novo. An acquisi-
t i on such as this inevitably adds to the concentration of resources in 
^his country. 
The above considerations are amplified by the size of 
applicant's organization and the fact that Applicant is paying a 
Substantial premium to acquire Acceptance (the premium involved is 
Per cent of equity capital and 46 per cent of total assets). I 
ha 
V e previously expressed my concern that the payment of substantial 
PtetI1iums in bank acquisitions by large banking organizations deprives 
th S e organizations less able to expand de novo of the opportunity to 

_ 3653 
-45-
acquire a vehicle through which they might achieve a competitive market 
Position (1972 Bulletin 62). I believe that such considerations are 
even more relevant where the premium is being paid for entry into new 
Unes of nonbanking businesses. 
Section 4(c)(8) requires that where there are possible adverse 
effects of a proposed acquisition or entry into a new line of nonbanking 
business such adverse effects be outweighed by reasonably expected 
P uHic benefits. Acceptance is a prospering, well managed company and 
1 find the record devoid of any such public benefits and would, therefore, 
deuy the application.

DELTA LOAN & FINANCE COMPANY 
Determination Regarding "Grandfather Privileges" 
Udder Bank Holding Company Act 
Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843) 
pt°vides certain privileges ("grandfather privileges") with respect 
to 
n°nbanking activities of a company that, by virtue of the 1970 Amend-
ments to the Bank Holding Company Act, became subject to the Bank Hold-
itlg ComPany Act. Pursuant to § 4(a)(2) of the Act, a "company covered

may continue to engage, either directly or through a subsidiary, 
n°nbanking activities that such a company was lawfully engaged in on

Notice of the Board's proposed review of the grandfather 
priviieges of the Delta Loan & Finance Company, St. Louis, Missouri, and 
an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views or 
re(luest a hearing, has been given (37 F.R. 22414). The time for filing 
0l&ments, views, and requests has expired, and all those received have 
beeri considered by the Board in light of the factors set forth in § 4(a)(2) 
°f 
Act. 
On the evidence before it, the Board makes the following findings. 
Delta T 
a u>an & Finance Company, St. Louis, Missouri ("Registrant"), became 
b a nk holding company on December 31, 1970, as a result of the 1970 Amend-
ments .. , 
t he Act, by virtue of Registrant's ownership of approximately 
cent of the voting shares of Jefferson Bank and Trust Company, St. 
^ i s v, 
8> Missouri ("Bank") (assets of $82.2 million as of December 31, 1970). 
* control of which was acquired by Registrant in January 1950, had total 
^Posit 
* of approximately $80 million as of December 31, 1971, representing 
e <-ver 2 per cent of the total deposits of the 27 commercial banks 
l n the c-if 
of St. Louis, and is the 14th largest of 88 banking organizations 
the St- r 
c. Loiis banking market. Bank's management, financial condition 
Pr°spects a*e regarded as satisfactory, and the Board has found no 
or any unsound banking practices. 
Registrant is a finance company and engages directly in consumer 
'Ns, c 
^ lo, 
n&> commercial lendit^, purchasing installment time sales contracts 
ari Participations with Bank, and apparently has engaged in such 

3667 
-3-
activities continuously since before June 30, 1968. In addition, Registrant 
h a s 
nonbanking subsidiaries which are engaged in nonbanking activities 
tllat appear eligible for grandfather benefits. Delta Loan & Finance Company 
0f Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee (acquired in July 1952) makes consumer 
commercial loans. Delta Discount Company, Memphis, Tennessee (acquired 
n March 1961) purchases installment time contracts. Valley Printing 
^Pany, st. Louis, Missouri (acquired in June 1954) is engaged in the 
Prlnt-i 
£ 
n 8 of supplies and forms almost exclusively for Registrant and 
its 
subsidiaries. Southeast Missouri Insurance & Finance Agency, Inc., 
W i s , Missouri (acquired in June 1954) makes direct loans secured 
by real estate. 
On the basis of total capital funds, Registrant ranks as the 
largest independent finance company in the United States; in the 
St. » . 
°uis market, Registrant competes with 20 of the 100 largest inde-
G n t U.S. finance companies and is smaller than any of these 20. 
^glstr 
» 
n t s three branch offices are located in southeastern Missouri-
's a t least 50 miles apart, each is more than 130 miles from St. Louis 
etnPhis and competes only in its respective area. Southeast Missouri 
e & Finance Agency, Inc. (also located in St. Louis) has an 
ltlai8nJf-i 
^ 
leant volume of loan activity with less than $10,000 in loans 
t a n d i n 8 as of December 31, 1971, and appears to have no current 
ce activity. Delta Loan & Finance of Tennessee and Delta Discount 
engage in consumer and commercial lending in Memphis, compete 
16 o f the 100 largest independent U.S. finance companies, are 

3 6 6 8 
-4-
5®aller than any of the 16 and compete also with 9 commercial banks, 
valley Printing, with assets of $89,000, competes with more than 300 
Minting firms in the St. Louis area, and it appears that 99 per cent 
its printing services are performed for Registrant and its subsidiaries. 
On the basis of the foregoing and all the facts before the Board, 
it 
appears that the volume, scope, and nature of the activities of 
e£istrant and its subsidiaries do not demonstrate an undue concentration 
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest nor 
Un8ound banking practices. 
There appears to be no reason to require Registrant to cease 
paging l n t h e a c t i v i t i e s i t e n g a g e s i n directly nor to require Registrant 
0 terminate its interests in its grandfathered subsidiaries. 
It is the 
5 judgment that, at this time, termination of the grandfather privileges 
Registrant is not necessary in order to prevent an undue concentration 
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or 
Utlsound K 
a banking practices. However, this determination is not authority to 
U 
into any activity that was not engaged in on June 30, 1968 and con-
U S l y thereafter, or any activity that is not the subject of this 
^ i n a t i o n . 
A significant alteration in the nature or extension of Registrant's 
Ctivities or a change in location thereof (significantly different from any 
Scribed in this determination) will be cause for a re-evaluation by the 
u ot Registrant's activities under the provisions of 5 4(a)(2) of the 
• that is, whenever the alteration or change is such that the Board finds 
A ct 

3669 
-5-
tIlat a termination of the grandfather privileges is necessary to prevent 
atl undue concentration of resources or any of the other evils designated 
i n the Act. No merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets other than in 
th 
6 ordinary course of business, nor acquisition of any interest in a going 
c°ncern, to which the Registrant or any nonbank subsidiary thereof is a 
P a t t y ®ay be consummated without prior approval of the Board. Further, the 
Pto 
vision of any credit, property, or service by the Registrant or any 
8ubsidiary thereof shall not be subject to any condition which, if 
^Posed by a bank, would constitute an unlawful tie-in arrangement under 
l06 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. 
The determination herein does not preclude a later review, 
by 
e Board, of Registrant's nonbank activities and a future determination 
by 
e Board in favor of termination of grandfather benefits of Registrant. 
6 ^termination herein is subject to the Board's authority to require 
^difi cation or termination of the activities of Registrant or any of 
n°nbanking subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure com-
^atice 
W 
t h e provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's regula-

Notice of the Board's proposed review of the grandfather 
Privileges of The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Flint, Michigan, and 
an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views or request 
a hearing, has been given (37 F.R. 22414). The time for filing comments, 
views, and requests has expired, and all those received have been considered 
hy the Board in light of the factors set forth in § 4(a)(2) of the Act. 
On the evidence before it, the Board makes the following findings. 
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Flint, Michigan ("Registrant"), became 
a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, as a result of the 1970 Amend-
ments to the Act, by virtue of Registrant's ownership of 58 per cent of the 
°utstanding voting shares of Wayne Oakland Bank, Royal Oak, Michigan ("Bank") 
(assets of $245.4 million as of December 31, 1970). Bank, control of which 
acquired by Registrant in July 1944, had total deposits of approximately 
million as of June 30, 1972, representing approximately 2 per cent of 
total commercial bank deposits in the Detroit SMSA, and is the ninth 
t g G st bank in the Detroit SMSA. In addition to its majority interest in 
» Registrant also owns 5 per cent of Gary National Bank ($298.7 million 
dePosits), Gary, Indiana, and less than 5 per cent of each of four other 
organizations of which one is located In Chicago, Illinois, two in 
Dstroit. 
I-'

Bank's management, financial 
C°n<Uti 
i on and prospects are regarded as satisfactory, and the Board has 
n o evidence of any unsound banking practices.

Registrant is a private,, charitable foundation which was estab-
lished in 1926 to maintain a fund and make grants from the fund for educa-
tional, health, and similar purposes that are intended to improve individual 
W'owth and development, and strengthen society. Registrant's total assets 
of December 31, 1971) amount to about $320 million, the bulk of which is 
rePresented by investments in 65 companies and banks; and, except as noted, 
^e8istrant's holdings in each of these is less than 5 per cent of the out-
2/ 
landing voting shares. 
Registrant has four nonbanking subsidiaries which 
Av 
e engaged in nonbanking activities that appear eligible for grandfather 
befits, namely, United States Sugar Corporation, Clewiston, Florida (acquired 
in December 1937), St. Louis County Water Corporation, University City, 
Missouri (acquired in July 1963), Missouri Water Company, University City, 
to 
8souri (acquire in July 1963), a subsidiary of St. Louis Water Corporation, 
and Everglades Corporation, Miami, Florida (acquired in January 1948). United 
St 
ates Sugar Corporation (about 37 per cent of the voting shares of which 
held by Registrant) is engaged principally in growing sugar cane and 
c*t U 
H i s t 
e raising and owns approximately 106,000 acres of land in Florida, 
rant's wholly-owned subsidiary Everglades Corporation operates lease-
hou

On the basis of the foregoing and all the facts before the 
Board, it appears that the volume, scope, and nature of the activities of 
Registrant and its subsidiaries do not demonstrate an undue concentration 
o f resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest nor 
Unsound banking practices. 
There appears to be no reason to require Registrant to terminate 
i t s grandfathered interests. 
It is the Board's judgment that, at this time, 
termination of the grandfather privileges of Registrant is not necessary 
n order to prevent an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair 
petition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. 
However, 
8 ^termination is not authority to enter into any activity that was not 
gaged in on June 30, 1968 and continuously thereafter, or any activity 
that io 
s not the subject of this determination. Nor is this determination 
author it-
ty for Registrant to acquire any additional real property or additional 
shares nf 
1 a nV company if the Registrant's holdings in said company will exceed 
^ Per cent of the outstanding voting shares of such company. 
A significant alteration in the nature or extension of Registrant's 
*<tlvlt, 
3 or a change in location thereof (significantly different from 
^ 
eribed i n this determination) will be cause for a re-evaluation by 
e Board f 
t 
Registrant's activities under the provisions of § 4(a)(2) of 
6 ^et, that-
c. 
c l s> whenever the alteration or change is such that the Board 
d s that 
v
 
a termination of the grandfather privileges is necessary to pre-
U n due concentration of resources or any of the other evils designated 
t h e Act 
M 
no merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets other than in

ordinary course of business, nor acquisition of any interest in a going 
concern, to which the Registrant or any nonbank subsidiary thereof is a 
Party may be consummated without prior approval of the Board. Further, the 
Provision of any credit, property, or service by the Registrant or any 
subsidiary thereof shall not be subject to any condition which, if 
ilnPosed by a bank, would constitute an unlawful tie-in arrangement under 
® 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. 
The determination herein does not preclude a later review 
the Board of Registrant's nonbank activities and a future determination 
^ the Board in favor of termination of grandfather benefits of Registrant. 
Th 
e ^termination herein is subject to the Board's authority to require 
or termination of the activities of Registrant or any of 
tta n°nbanking subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure com-
Plia 
n c e with the provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's regula-
'-to 
n s and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasions thereof.
