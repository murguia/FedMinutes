The

 Partnership acquired control of these five banks from 1955 to 1969

^eprespnt-
a
 restructuring of an existing bank holding company from a

 the banks, the limited market areas served by them and the probability

Ptospect for meaningful competition developing in the future among these

 of the State. 
The financial conditon and managerial resources of the proposed 
Subg-f J1

State National Corporation, Evanston, Illinois, has applied for

First Pennsylvania Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

c p R 225.4(a)(1), (3) and (9)(ii)(a). 
Notice of the applications, affording opportunity for 
t e r
ested persons to submit comments and views on the public 
n t e r e s t
 factors, has been duly published (37 Federal Register 
& 9 9
7-l6998). The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
0t
*e has been timely received. 
Applicant's banking subsidiary, First Pennsylvania Banking 
Company ("Bank"), is the second largest bank in Pennsylvania 
n e
 largest in the Philadelphia market area, with total deposits 

3804 
-2-
o f
 $2.6 billion as of June 30, 1972. Applicant also has non-
inking subsidiaries engaged principally in mortgage banking, 
consumer financing, data processing, personal property and 
e
quipment leasing and in providing investment advisory services. 
Great Acceptance is engaged in the consumer finance 
b u
siness with three offices in the Houma, Louisiana, market, 
^hich includes Terrebonne Parish and parts of Lafourche Parish. 
It:
 competes for personal loans in the Houma market with eight 
commercial banks and approximately 25 other consumer finance 
Cor
npanies, including a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of 
^PPlicant, Termplan of Houma, Inc. ("Termplan"). Estimates of 
t h e m a
rket shares held by Great Acceptance and Termplan reflect 
c
°ntrol of less than 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively 
of 
Personal loans outstanding - the combined figure amounting 
t o
 iess than 9 per cent of the market share held by all consumer 
^ar\c e companies. Consummation of this proposed transaction 
°
ul<1
 therefore eliminate some existing competition. However, 
Either Great Acceptance nor Termplan controls a significant 
h a r e
 of the consumer finance business in the relevant geographic 
^rket-
Moreover, because of the large number of remaining 
"•Petitors, the many potential entrants and the relative ease 
Of 
e n t r
V into the consumer finance business, the adverse effect 
* competition is considered slight. Since Applicant is 
operating in the. llouma market, it it not a potential 

3305 
-3-
e
ntrant. The prospects of Great Acceptance establishing 
additional offices in other markets served by Applicant is 
considered remote. Therefore, consummation of the proposed 
transaction would have no adverse effect on potential com-
petition. 
Pearce Colvin, also engaged in the consumer finance 
^Qiness, began operations during August, 1970, and had total 
l o a
ns outstanding of approximately $440,000 as of March 31, 
1972 
It operates one office in the Ruston, Louisiana, market, 
in 
v;
hich there are eight other finance companies and three 
0n
®iercial banks. Applicant does not operate a consumer finance 
u b s
idiary in the Ruston market, its closest consumer finance 
u b s
idiary being located 30 miles east at Monroe, Louisiana. 
Appi j 
cant does have the financial and managerial resources to 
market de novo. However, the effect upon potential 
petition is considered slight because of the many potential 
a c
s and the ease of entry into the relevant product market. 
r i j 
^oivin is not considered a likely entrant into other 
^rket 
s
 served by Applicant because of its limited resources 
*Perience. It is the Board's conclusion that approval 
of thi 
8
 Proposed transaction would have no adverse effect on 
competition and only a slightly adverse effect on 
e n t
ial competition. 

. 3 8 9 6 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that 
consummation of either of the proposed transactions would 
result in any undue concentration of resources, unfair corn-
Petition, unsound banking practices, or other adverse effects 
in the public interest. Approval of the acquisitions will make 
Mailable to Great Acceptance and Pearce Colvin the financial 
managerial resources of Applicant and enable them to better 
compete in their respective markets and to provide improved 
Ending services. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations 
reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the 
Glance of the public Interest factors the Board is required 
t o
 consider under section 4(c)(8) is favorable. Accordingly, 
t h e
 Applications are hereby approved. This determination is 
8 u b
ject to the conditions set forth in section 225.4(c) of

^ification or termination of the activities of a holding

.' 
TO THE BOARD 
December 2.9, 1972 
The Board appreciates the efforts and is aware of the 
r e s
pcnsibilities of the directors and executive officers of the 
Reserve Banks In developing and implementing discretionary ex-
penditure policies consistent with the important public role the 
Banks nlay in rhe economv of the nation, their districts, and In 
their communities. We hope, however, m a t an additional degree ot 
sensitivity may be achieved among the Banks because of the public 
?
v i e w
t shared by the Board, that the System as a whole is responsi-
ble for carrying out its statutory responsibilities in the #most 
e f
A c t i v e and economical manner feasible. 
It is the Board's ex-
p i a t i o n that this policy statement, and the accompanying principles, 
V J
-U assist in this regard and yet leave with the Banks a degree of 
latitude in formulating their own expenditure policies to meet the 
P a r
ticular needs of their districts. 
The Board feels that the expenditures policies of the 
Scleral Reserve Banks must take cognizance of the Government' s 
!

'dual interest hi the earning:; o£ the System. The Board reaffirms 
own responsibility in this regard. Conversely, the Boaxd recog-
that the regional and decentralized character of the System, 
corporate form of Reserve Bank organisation whose day-to-day 
a f f
airs are administered under a board oi directors and executive 
0 1 1
icors, and the absence of provision for any direct governmental 
^PPropriations, are evidence of an intent by Congress that the Reserve 
°
a
nks have latitude in determining what are reasonable and proper 
f*-psnses in particular circumstances, subject to the general super-
of the Board. Accordingly, a substantial degree o»: 

3808 
-31-
tesponsibiiity rests upon the directors and executive officers of 
the Reserve Banks to assure that their policies concerning expendi-
tures of a discretionary nature, and the implementation of those 
policies, are consistent with the public nature of the banks and the 
intent of Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act to limit expenditures 
to those that are necessary to the conduct of the affairs of the 
Reserve Banks. 
General Principles 
Two general principles underlie the consideration of 
a
Ppropriate expenditures problems. The first is that standards 
demanded of both public and private officials are rising. 
Standards 
v
*»Jch might have been acceptable only a few years ago are no longer 
a
eceptable. 
Practices which might otherwise be perfectly justifi-
a
^le must be examined for their appearance. 
The second principle is that the public-private nature of 
the System puts us in an unique position. On the one hand, ;ve must 
aware of the requirements of public bodies and must conform as 
^arly as practicable with the spirit of those requirements. On the 
other hand, to preserve the advantages of regionalism, we must allow 
sufficient flexibility to recognize community practices where such 
Captation is warranted and appropriate. 
Criteria 
In evaluating expenditures, the Federal Reserve Banks 
should carefully weigh the suitability and propriety of ail circum-
stances surrounding the expense, but in particular the name, business 
occupation of the payee, any appearances which reasonably could 
0 cr
itici?;ed as extravagant or lavish, any connotations or appear-
a u c
e s of sponsorship or endorsement by a Reserve Bank which payment 
carry or imply, and actual or potential conflict of interest from 
viewpoint of sources of criticism which may be external and un~ 
am
ili.ar with the System. 
In addition to consideration of expenses 
suitable and proper, the following criteria should be used by the 
°serve Banks in amplifying judgments of appropriateness: 
Cost vs. benefits. Does the expenditure yield benefits 
terms oFemployee productivity, morale, and relations? 
Does the 
^J'endirure promote or serve the objectives of the System and/or the 
V
v
;
3
erve hank'in dealing with member banks and the business or 
^artcia.l community? 
Does the expenditure serve or reflect social 
' U^tioivji goals which the Federal Reserve System supports or 
^ c r s e s as a matter of policy? 
Arc the benefits expected from the 
~
Xl
'°
ll
'
:
Utu>-o equitably distributed? 

3809 
-32-
Communlty practice. 
Is the expenditure in line with 
Practices of progressive firns and Federal government agencies in 
the community? 
Uniformity within the System. Are expenditures at a given 
eserve Bank reasonably in line with general practices in other 
Reserve Banks? 
The use of these criteria is intended as an approach to 
Providing discretionary latitude to bank management and, concurrently, 
to strengthening nechanisms by which expenditures can be reviewed 
t-rtd inappropriate expenditures avoided. The. Board deems it essen-
l a
l that each Reserve Bank control discretionary expenditures with 
Policies which have been formally approved by its board of directors, 
responsibility for administering such policies delegated to 
"Pacific officers. These policies and their administration Ghouj.d 
be reviewed periodically. 
In addition, the Board is of the opinion 
^ i-3.t the banks should observe as a part, of such policies, certain 
0 a
d principles which are set forth in the supplemental memorandum 
a t
tached hereto. 
^ 
In this respect, the Board's examiners will be instructed 
note during the course of an examination whether the bank's internal 
^ AC2.es and the expenditures made thereunder, are consistent with 
/ ^ principles. 
The Board's examiners will, continue to report 
* dividual expenditure items to the Board considered questionable, 
-ch matter, upon review, the Board may directly take up with the 
~~
r
-ular bank concerned. 
In addition, the examiners will coumienl 
adequacy of supporting records to assure that they state 
-t-arly a n d accurately the nature of the expenditure.

Principles to be followed for Certain Kinds 
of Discretionary Expenses 
Employee Relations 
The Board is of the opinion that Federal Reserve Banks have the 
to make appropriations from their funds for the purpose of employee 
Nation 
1(
Hvir 
is. Bank policies concerning such matters should observe the foi 
'8 guidelines: 
(1) Expenditures of bank funds to employee clubs for social, 
recreational, and athletic activities should be kept 
within reasonable amounts with, the total maximum expense 
authorized per annum established on the basis of a dol-
lar amount per employee. 
The Board continues to be of the opinion that in the 
ease of annual dinners, Christmas parties, and similar 
affairs given by a Reserve Bank for its own employees, 
the inclusion of wives and husbands of the bank's em-
ployees (and guests of unmarried employees) at bank 
expense is proper. Such expenditures should be based 
upon written policy. The Board would deem it improper 
to expend bank funds for an activity or program ob-
viously designed to imparc favoritism on a discrimi-
natory basis to a select group of officers or employees. 
Annual functions for long service employees would net be. 
considered discriminatory where all employees witn such 
?engch of service are eligible to participate 

3811 
-34-
(3) Expenditures by one Reserve Bank for meals outside the 
bank for officers and employees of other Reserve Banks 
(and their spouses) attending meetings of conventions 
would be improper. 
Employee Recognition 
Reasonable expenditures for mementos to retiring officers and 
employees, service certificates, pins, emblems, or other tangible

Pioper if authorized as a parr, of an employee relations program approved

Bank policy should also set forth rules governing bank expen-
diture °
s
 tor employee receptions, luncheons, and other occasions designed 
to p < 
K-ve recognition to an individual employee, or group of employees, as 
ot che bank's employee relations program. Such affairs should not 
'"-'Id at bank expense outside a Reserve office except where the facil-
ities 
^Herein will not reasonably accommodate the function. 
In any case,

 for additional 
Ho-, , 
should be cited.

Training andEducation 
If the Reserve Banks are to maintain their positions as viable 
°
r
ganizations, they must pay increasing attention to management develop-
ment, training, and education program. If they are to open to all 
P
e
rscnnel possibilities for growth in service and promotions to higher 
positions, as well as develop personnel to handle the complex technical 
9ric
* ^nagement problems which the future holds, it will be necessary act 
°
n1
-y tc continue but. also to improve training and educational programs, 
the same time, educational programs should conform to certain minimum 
such as the following: 
College and university tuition reimbursement programs for 
^Ployees participating in a degree program taking job-related courses 
SVjo i , 
'^tj.c he bared on a minimum period of bank service. Further employees 
S&p r 
orally should earn a minimum specific grade prior lo receiving 
"
uu
rse,'ient (requirements would differ depending on whether the em-
3 s 
a n undergraduate or graduate program). All schedules 
^or t. • < 
L U
-tion reimbursement should be in line with community practice. 
Schools, outside seminars, and other job related training and 
"Nation programs should be administered in accordance with prescribed 
deduces at each Reserve Bank before expense! are paid for such programs. 
Payment of tuition for employees who receive passing grades in 
Jl
-an. Institute of Banking courses is good management policy. By i.n~

°
re
 emphasis than ever in this sphere. Guidelines for tuition reimburse-
BlLI)
'
t u
nder this program should be similar to those for the college program. 
Travel 
Each Reserve Bank should have a written statement of policy with 
t s
poct to permissible expenditures for travel, including purpose, method, 
and 
tiort with the conduct of bank or System business. In this connection 
;
lass of travel. Expenses for travel should be authorized only ii 
c
°nnoc 
Board recognizes that representation by Reserve Bank personnel at 
ban?..- „ 
U
-S and business functions is an appropriate part of a bank relations 
Wain, and that valuable contributions can be made by Reserve Bank staff 
by 
boring requests for lectures, speaking engagements, and other such 
u
nances. Care should be. taken, however, that such, occasions are 
°n-ibly related to the carrying out of bank and System responsibilities. 
Travel regulations may provide for a daily per diem allowance, 
fcimbursement: of actual expenses, or a combination of the two. 
Where travel regulations provide for reimbursement of food, 
"i°ftation and lodging based on actual expense, provision should be 
tricld
t iv 
' 
'
c r
 expenditures in line with community standards. Travel regulations 
* 
quire explanation of any unusual and extenuating circumstances. 
W 
Dinners, Luncheons, Meetings and Ent^rf^nnmnt_ 
In approving expenditures for employee attendance at dinners, 
u,- 5 
-At;,-
t-ons 
uie iLings, consideration should be given to the purpose of 

-37-
activity. Appropriate purposes include establishing and maintaining 
0r
'Wiunication between a Reserve Bank and community firms, banks, and 
ninerit, 
The Reserve Bank should be prepared to explain the relevant 
*
tfi
i-est of the individual attending, his contribution to the affair, 
°
r
 thr \ 
oenetits that may accrue to his training or experience. 
In selecting a meeting or conference site, consideration should 
to location (accessibility, convenience, etc.); size (fitting 
the 
needs of the group --comfortable but not plush); cost (reasonable but 
A L r
avagant); atmosphere (conducive to business discussion). 
Expenditures in this category should be made in accordance with 
- aaministrative pclicies which observe the following: 
Expenditures should be made within reasonable limits. 
Where a bank incurs a direct expense for a meeting, 
conference, or other official function, the purpose 
for the occasion and its relationship to the business 
affairs of the bank should be described. 
J
 
wnere adequate to accommodate an official function, 
the facilities of a Reserve office shquld generally 
be used, 
When the function is held outside a Reserve office, 
the reasons for the use thereof should be cited and 
0
 cost comparison should be made between different 
fcatablislunents offering service and accornmodations 

-38-
adequate to handle the function. Although the 3oard 
recognizes that locale, convenience, service, quality 
of food, and room accommodation are factors to be 
considered in making a selection, cost should also 
be an important consideration. 
(4) Expenditures for luncheons and dinners, etc., should 
be limited to official functions reasonably related 
to, or in furtherance of, the business affairs of 
the bank. 
In addition, documentation supporting the 
expenditure should include a listing of the business 
guests and visitors, except tour groups. 
(:>) Expenditures for outside catering services in con-
nection with the entertainment cc official bank 
guests in the homes of Reserve Bank officials may 
be considered proper where a special occasion 
demands it. However, such expenditures should be 
carefully scrutinized and bear a reasonable re-
lationship to the costs that would be incurred if the 
official guests were entertained elsewhere. 
Vft) Bank p o l i c y statements should cover circumstances 
under which officers and employees nsy not be charged 
for meals in the bank.

Membership Dues and Contributions 
The policies of each Reserve Bank covering expenditures for 
Membership dues, contributions, and subscriptions should require re-
V i e w
 by the Board of Directors of a Reserve Bank of these categories 
0 f
 expanse. 
Expenditures for membership dues should be limited to: 
(1) Organizations whose purpose and activities are 
directly related to the business affairs of the 
bank either by assisting personnel in the perform-
ance of their duties or by assisting the bank in 
carrying out official programs or policies, 
(?) Organizations who, as a part of membership ben-
efits, issue publications directly related to the 
business affairs of the bank, or are of informational 
benefit to bank personnel in the performance of 
their duti.es. 
Personal memberships in professional or technical association: 
^ 
< i 
v
°nsidered improper exccpt when bank memberships are not available 
if] l
&anlzations whose activities are of direct and important value to 
a P 
4 3 c r
v e Bank in conducting bank business or where a membership fee is 
* r-> 
4
"
Ce
s»axy coat directly related to the training of an employee. 

Expenditures for a membership in a social, college, luncheon 
or service group should be considered improper unless it can be clearly 
demonstrated that the bank should be represented in such an organization 
because participation in its activities will make an important direct 
contribution to the conduct of the bank's affairs. 
Expenditures should not be authorized for direct financial 
donations or contributions to national and community civic, welfare, ana 
charitable projects or causes. The Board is of the opinion that direct 
financial expenditures are not directly related to the conduct of the 
business affairs of the banks no matter how worthy the purpose underlyin 
s
*ch projects or causes may be. If, in a special circumstance, a bank 
Cft
n clearly demonstrate it will receive an important direct benefit by 
Virtue of financial participation in a civic or community project, it 
£ h
«uld submit a request outlining the reasons therefor 
to the Board of 
Governors for its consideration and approval. 
Director Recognji-_ti_on 
Expenditures of bank funds for mementos to retiring directors 
^ y be made, but within dollar limitations established for individual 
itcns. The Soard appreciates the inestimable value to the System cu 
^rvices rendneed by Reserve Bank directors in the public interest and 

-41-
Relieves it appropriate that recognition in some tangible form be given 
t o
 them upon leaving office. However, the Board is of the opinion that 
principal reason for the expenditure of bank funds for such purpose 
b e
 to convey to retiring directors a display of appreciation for public 
service. As opportunities present themselves, Reserve Banks should 
f
evie.w such expenditures to assure thac they are reasonable. 
Honorariums 
In reviewing expenditures for honorariums, consideration 
sh
°u]d be given to the importance of the subject matter in relation to 
Bank's performance of its responsibilities, the professional level 
aric!
 responsibility of the speaker, the appropriateness for the occasion, 
*
n d
 the size of the group involved in bearing the speaker, 
For purposes of education of employees or Bank and employee 
N a t i o n s , it frequently may be desirable to engage speakers who require 
-
h e
 Payment of fees.
