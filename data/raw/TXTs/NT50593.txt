through the Spanish Foreign Exchange Institute, for a period of three 
months through June 30, 1970. The extension had been authorized yester-

telegram 
sent to the New York Bank is attached as Item No. 1.

Board members make their whereabouts known to Mr. Holland in case an 
emergency required communication over the week end. 
Mr. Keir reported that the Government securities market had not 
thus far been adversely affected by the strike, although the Treasury

The stock exchanges were perhaps the most vulnerable of all the secu-
rities markets and%might be closed on Monday.
