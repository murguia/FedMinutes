Federal Reserve Bank budgets for 1974. In a memorandum of 
December 18, 1973, the Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities 
recommended approval, with certain exceptions, of the proposed 1974 
budgets of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, 
and authorization of spending at the current rate by the Federal Reserve 
ftanks of Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis pending further study of 
their budget proposals. Proposed Reserve Bank budgets were submitted 
by 
the Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations with a memorandum 
°f December 17, 1973. 
With respect to the nine Reserve Bank budgets being recommended 
for approval, the Committee recommended limiting increases in spending 
for Services to the Economy and the Public and for Supervision and Regu-
lation to 8 per cent of such expenditures for 1973, pending further 
exPlanation by any Bank requesting an additional increase. The Committee 
also recommended that expenditures for Check Processing and Return Items 
l n the New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Los Angeles offices 
a n d for Data Processing Services and Data Processing/Data Communications 
Ecluipment Rentals at the New York Bank be authorized only at the current 
rate pending further study, and that all Data Processing/Data Communi-
Cations Equipment Purchases at the New York Bank be deferred pending 
further justification.

During discussion, several Board members expressed concern 
with the implications of an 8 per cent ceiling on increases in spending 
for Services to the Economy and the Public. Concern was also expressed 
that the recommended 8 per cent ceiling on increases in spending for 
Supervision and Regulation would impede the timely processing of bank 
holding company and merger applications. 
After further discussion, the Board unanimously approved the 
recommendations of the Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities 
as set forth above, with the additional stipulation that all Federal 
Reserve Banks would be requested to limit expenditures for travel 
during 1974 to 80 per cent of actual travel expenditures during 1973. 
It was understood that the travel limitations and the 8 per cent ceiling 
°n increases in spending for Services to the Economy and the Public and 
for Supervision and Regulation could be adjusted, on a Bank-by-Bank 
basis, upon a demonstration of need. It was also understood that the 
Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities would prepare further 
Proposals regarding the three Reserve Banks authorized to continue 
spending at current levels and regarding the other exceptions in the 
Committee's memorandum of December 18 applicable to the remaining 
Reserve Banks. 
In response to a suggestion by Chairman Burns, it was agreed 
that the Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities would prepare a 
Proposal regarding the designation of a budget director at the Board 

4931

to oversee the preparation of Reserve Bank budgets. It was also 
agreed that the Committee on Financial Statistics would prepare a 
proposal regarding the selection of directors of research at the 
Federal Reserve Banks and the evaluation of Reserve Bank Research 
Departments. 
Copies of the letters sent to the Reserve Banks informing 
them of today's budget actions are attached under Item No. 1. 
Governor Sheehan withdrew from the meeting at this point, and 
Messrs. Bryant, Director, and Norwood, Adviser, Division of Interna-
tional Finance, entered the room. 
Revision of VFCR Guidelines. At its meeting on October 23, 
1973, the Board held a preliminary discussion concerning relaxation 
°f the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines. In a memoran-
dum of December 19, 1973, Governor Brimmer recommended approval of 
Proposed amendments to the guidelines in view of similar actions under-
stood to be planned by the Departments of Treasury and Commerce, 
respectively, concerning the Interest Equalization Tax and the Foreign 
Direct Investment Program. 
After discussion, the Board unanimously approved the recommended 
amendments to the VFCR Guidelines, effective January 1, 1974. A copy 
the press release containing the revised guidelines is attached as 
itemNo. 2.

Chase Manhattan Corporation--Dial Financial Corporation. At 
its meeting on November 21, 1973, the Board considered the application 
°f The Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, New York, to acquire 
shares of Dial Financial Corporation, Des Moines, Iowa, but deferred 
action pending development of additional information. In a memorandum 
°f December 18, 1973, the Division of Research and Statistics provided 
further analysis of possible public benefits to be derived from the 
Proposed acquisition. In view of its conclusion that ensuing public 
benefits would be negligible, the Division continued to recommend that 
Board deny the application. 
After discussion, the Board denied the application, Governor 
°aane dissenting on the basis of his view of the public benefits 
associated with the proposal. It was understood that documentation 
t o implement this decision would be prepared for the Board's considera-
tion.

Martin Building. On July 25, 1972, in order to increase the 
utilization of the Martin Building, the Board approved in principle 
a Plan to convert approximately 28,000 square feet in the second garage 
level from parking spaces to office space with the understanding that 
such conversion would result in an additional expenditure of approxi-
mately $1 million. In memoranda of December 12, 1973, and December 18, 
1973, respectively, Messrs. Melnicoff and Doyle discussed a possible 
further conversion of second garage level space, which, on the basis of 
a bid by the builder, Chas. H. Tompkins Co., would make available a 
total of 60,000 square feet in the second garage level for shops and 
fices at a total cost of about $2.6 million. The Board had given 
Preliminary consideration to this matter at its meeting on December 13, 
1973.

After discussion, the Board authorized the staff to negotiate 
a supplemental agreement with Chas. H. Tompkins Co. for the conversion 
of the second garage level to office and shop space as proposed at a 
cost not to exceed $2.6 million. 
Rehabilitation of Board Building. In a memorandum of Decem-
ber 12, 1973, Mr. Melnicoff compared cost and space availability 
considerations relating to a maximum versus a minimum rehabilitation 
of the Board Building and requested guidance concerning future office 
space planning. 
After discussion, the Board deferred further consideration of 
this matter pending additional study by the staff of future space 
needs and of long-run operating cost implications of each of the 
rehabilitation options, particularly with respect to rental costs 
for outside space. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Item No. 2 
12/20/73 
F°r immediate release 
December 26, 1973 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today issued 
amGndments to its Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint (VFCR) Guidelines 
increase foreign lending and investment ceilings for banks and 
OtVi 
e r financial institutions subject to the program and that will 
liroinate differences in the degrees of restraint on lending in developed 
°ountriea. 
The announcement is being made in conjunction with actions by the 
Gasury a n d c o m m e r c e Departments to change the Interest Equalization 
(IET) and the Foreign Direct Investment Regulations. The three pro-
stata 
constitute a set: of restraints on capital outflow that have been 
Part 
an overall Government program to help the U.S. balance of payments. 
P 
the 
Xhe 
I V J 
aeral Reserve has administered the VFCR program since early 1965 at 
request of the President. 
The VFCR amendments approved by the Board, effective January 1, 
« 
e as follows: 
1) The present ceiling for each commercial bank is increased to 
mtin 
l o n or to an amount 4 per cent above the ceiling in effect 
tGJ-y prior to the present revision. Heretofore ceilings have 
upward in size from $500,000, depending on the size of the bank or 
°n ito 
s historical record in foreign lending. Banks without ceilings 
old foreign assets of types subject to restraint up to the lesser 
^ $500,000 or (b) 2 per cent of their end-of-1970 total assets. 
fcl 
amendment, the $500,000 minimum figure for banks with ceilings is 
^ 
$ ]0 R m*Uion. Banks previously without ceilings but adopting them

under the amendment will be expected to observe the established principle 
that the ceilings are. for loans generated directly by the "newcomer" bank 
9 n d n°t for loans initiated by other U.S. banks, t -
2) The request that banks refrain from making non-export loans 
with maturities of over one year to residents of the developed countries 
continent.al Western Europe is eliminated. Such loans by a bank will be 
l e f t to compete for "the bank's available Guideline ceiling with loans to 
Growers in other foreign areas. In general, ouch loans are, and will at 
tllls time remain, subject to the IET. 
, r 
. . 
' « 3 ) U.S. agencies and.branches of foreign banks will have a 
e i U n g 0f a t i e a s t 
m i H i o n f o r making foreign loans and other invest-
ments f 
°t types restrained under the Program. The present minimum ceiling

... u.tf; 
. • .. 1;(t 
, 
Agencies and branches will be able to recalculate the "base 
f°reign position", which determines the relationship between their 
oi8n lending and foreign borrowing, by using 96 per cent of their 
l G i g n liabilities for June 30, 1973. They will thereby be allowed to 
ificreaq 
o G foreign assets, or to decrease foreign liabilities, by approxi-
mately , 
H per cent from amounts determined by the previous formula. 
5) The restraint against term loans to the developed countries 
° f contin 
•cental Western Europe will be dropped for agencies and branches, 
98 It ! 
8 being dropped for banks. 
The ceiling of each nonbank financial institution (which 
include8 > among others, insurance companies, finance companies, and 

4959 
ttutual funds) will" bk increased to- an amount' 5 per Cent above that in effect 
a t the end of 1972'or to $'2 million, whichever is higher. 
r'• 
4 .* > 
7) The request that honbank financial institutions refrain from . 
^creasing their loans and investments in the developed countries of 
Coi*tinental 
Western Europe beyond the amount held at the end of 1968 is 
eUminated. Any increase in such investments is left to compete for 
aVailable latitude under an institution's Guideline ceiling with other 
foreign loans and investments. The IET will continue to apply to 3ome of 
t h e s e loans and investments.

8) 'Periodic reports will continue to be filed by all banking 
^ t i tut ions with $500,000 or more in foreign assets and by all nonbank 
fj 
Uncial institutions with $500,000 or more in foreign assets of types 
°ubject to restraint or with $5 million or more of total foreign assets.
