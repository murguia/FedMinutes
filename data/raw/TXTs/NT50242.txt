Recording of votes (Item No. 1). At the Board meeting on 
March 18, 1968, in connection with discussion of the draft record of 
Board policy actions for 1967, question had been raised regarding the 
manner in which votes were set forth in the policy records of the 
Board and the Federal Open Market Committee. It was noted that the 
omission of an absent member's name from the list of those voting for 
or against an action might suggest that the absent member had actually 
been present but had abstained from voting. The staff was asked to 
suggest some means of removing this source of possible misunderstand-
ing. Attached as Item No. 1 is a copy of a memorandum from the Office 
of the Secretary dated March 21, 1968, prepared in response to that 
request. 
After discussion, agreement was expressed with the procedures 
suggested in the memorandum, and it was understood that they would be 
followed in preparing the 1968 policy record entries. 
Policy record entry. There had been distributed, with a memo-
randum from Mr. Broida dated March 20, 1968, a draft of policy record 
e
ntry for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on 
January 9, 1968, as revised to take into account comments received 
following the distribution of a preliminary draft. 
In view of questions raised by members of the Board, action 
°n the draft entry was deferred to permit further study of certain 
Passages in light of the minutes (memorandum of discussion) covering 
the January 9 meeting.

Interpretation of margin regulations (Item No. 2). Question 
had been raised regarding the date as of which collateral (including 
convertible debt securities) must be valued to calculate the amount 
of the required deposit of margin in connection with purpose credit 
extended under Regulations U and G prior to March 11, 1968, to bring 
that credit to full margin by April 10, 1968. 
A memorandum from Messrs. Solomon and Shuter dated March 19, 
1968, proposed an interpretation that the valuation date could be 
either the date the credit was extended or March 11, 1968, whichever 
caused the loan valuation to be higher. 
The issuance of such an interpretation was approved unanimously. 
A copy is attached as Item No. 2. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Note: At 10:30 a.m. a meeting 
was held with representatives of the New 
York Clearing House Association relating 
to the objections of the Clearing House 
to section 221.3(u) of Regulation U, hav-
ing to do with a bank acting as agent. 
A transcript of the meeting was made and 
has been placed in the Board's files. 
Secretary's Notes: On March 21, 1968, 
a letter was sent to First National City 
Bank, New York, New York, acknowledging 
receipt of notice of its intent to estab-
lish an additional branch in Germany, to 
be located in Duesseldorf.

Board of Governors 
SUBJECT: Treatment of absent members 
in recording votes in policy 
FROM: Office of the Secretary 
records 
At the Board meeting on March 18, 1968, in connection with 
discussion of the draft record of Board policy actions for 1967, there 
W a
s further discussion of the manner in which votes are currently 
indicated in the policy records of the Board and Federal Open Market Com-
mittee. It was noted that present procedures, in which an absent member's 
n a
me is omitted from the lists of those voting for and against an action, 
might suggest to some readers of the record that the absent member had 
b e
en present but had abstained from voting on the action. 
(Actual 
a
bstentions have, of course, always been recorded, but they have been rare.) 
The staff was asked to suggest some means for removing this 
s
°urce of possible misunderstanding. Specifically, the staff was asked 
; "l ' • 
t o
 consider whether there would be any problems in adding a category 
members "Absent and not voting," such as is novz used in recording 
v
°tes on Board orders under the Bank Merger and Holding Company Acts. 
In considering this question, the staff has assumed that 
Board wishes to continue the present practice of limiting the list 
those voting on an action to the members who are physically present 
r
 on the telephone hook-up, in an FOMC telephone conference meeting) 
the time the vote is taken. It has also been assumed that any new 
Pt
°cedures would be adopted effective with the policy records for 1968. 

•V7. • 
In the staffs judgment, the addition of a category for 
xa tuts stmi'"
 
4 
Members "Absent and not voting.-" where relevant, would pose no 
Particular problems in the Board's policy record. Nor would it 
ordinarily pose a problem for Board-members of the FOMC in the 
Committee's policy record. A question arises, however, with respect 
t o
 the treatment of absent President-members of the FOMC, since their 
a
lternates normally vote in their place. 
To illustrate one possible procedure, assume that (a) 
M e
ssrs. Robertson, Hayes, and Kimbrel are absent at an FOMC meeting; 
(2) Mr. Treiber is serving as alternate for Mr. Hayes, but Mr. Coldwell 
Kimbrel's alternate) is also absent; and (3) Mr. Mitchell abstains 
'it-; Vf . " " " 
the 
vote in question, but other members vote favorably. The vote 
m
*-Sht then be recorded as follows: 
Votes for this action: Messrs. Martin, 
Brimmer, Daane, Ellis, Galusha, Hickman, Maisel, 
Sherrill, and Treiber. Votes against this action: 
None. Present but not voting: Mr. Mitchell. 
Absent and not voting: Mr. Robertson, 
Mr. Hayes (Mr. Treiber voted as his alternate), 
and Mr. Kimbrel. 
As indicated, the procedure would call for a second paragraph 
l i s t i
-ng absent members of the Committee and indicating parenthetically, 
^
h e r e
 appropriate, the alternate who voted in place of the absent 
^mber. 
T h e 
p u r p 0 8 e 
o f placing this information in a separate para-
8 r a
Ph would be to preserve an unencumbered first paragraph specifying 
th 
6
 Position taken on the question by each voter, in a form like 

L " * < • 
1144 
-3-
' V U- 'i • 
. 
i 
thdfc now used. (Thfete toould seem to be no need for paragraphing in the 
Board's policy record.) 
A rather different type of problem is illustrated by the 
tentative treatment of absent F0I1C members on page 10 of the revised 
draft policy record entry for the Committee meeting of January 9, 
» • 
distributed under date of March 20. On occasion, when Committee members 
find it necessary to enter a meeting late or leave early, there are 
differences in the lists of members voting in different actions taken 
a t
 the meeting. It might be confusing in such cases to record a member 
a
s voting on one action and simply as "absent and not voting" on another. 
*t would seem better to indicate that the member was "Absent at this 
p
°int in meeting and not voting," as shown in the January 9 entry.

For immediate release 
Item No. 2 
3/22/68 
March 27, 1968 
In response to questions, the Board of Governors today 
issued an interpretation regarding the date to be used by a bank 
(subject to Regulation U) or other lender (subject to Regulation 
G) in valuing collateral (including convertible bonds) posted to 
meet margin requirements set by recent amendments to the Board's 
regulations governing stock market credit. These amendments 
specified that additional collateral, as required, must be de-
Posited by April 10 in connection with certain loans made prior 
to March I1 . 
In order to determine the amount of the additional deposit 
required, it is necessary to value the collateral originally secur-
ing the loan. The Board has determined that such collateral should 
be valued as of the date the loan was originally made, or as of 
March 11., whichever gives the higher figure. 
The effect of the Board's interpretation is to limit the 
amount of additional margin a borrower will have to put up to the 
amount he would have had to deposit in connection with a fully 
m a
rgined loan on the date the loan was made. However, where a 
security has increased in value since the time the loan was made, 
the borrower may take advantage of the added value in determining 
t
^e amount of additional deposit which he must make to comply with 
t
*
le
 requirements of the regulations. 

If made against stocks, loans subject to the requirement 
must be brought up to a 70 per cent margin ($70 down for each $100 
worth of securities purchased) and if against convertible bonds, 
such loans must be brought up to a 50 per cent margin ($50 down 
for each $1.00 worth of convertible bonds purchased). 
Valuation will be required, and loans must be brought into 
conformity with margin requirements by April 10, in the following 
situations: 
1. Where a loan was made by a bank, subject to Regulation 
U, after October 20, 1967, and prior to March 11, 1968, for the 
purpose of purchasing or carrying a debt security convertible into 
registered stock, if the loan is secured by any stock or by a 
security convertible into stock. 
2. Where a loan was made after February 1, 1968, and prior 
to March 11, 1968, by a lender subject to Regulation G, and the loan 
' 
:

 (i) for the purpose of purchasing or carrying a registered equity 
security (including a bond convertible into such a security), and 
( i d the loan was secured by such a security.
