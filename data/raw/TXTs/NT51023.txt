Item No. 1

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
MANUFACTURERS NATIONAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
Manufacturers National Corporation, Detroit, Michigan, has 
applied for the BoardTs approval under § 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding company through 
acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' qualifying 
shares) of the successor by merger to Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, 
Detroit, Michigan, ("Bank"). The bank into which Bank is to be merged 
has no significance except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of 
^ e voting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquistion of shares 
°f the successor organization is treated herein as the proposed acquisition 
the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
^one has been timely received. The Board has considered the application in 
Xight of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant is a nonoperating company formed for the express purpose 
o f acquiring Bank ($2.0 billion deposits). 
(Banking data are as of 
June 30, 1972.) 
Bank, located in the city of Detroit, operates seventy-one 
domestic branches in the Detroit metropolitan area and one foreign branch. 
Since the purpose of the proposed transaction is to effect corporate 
ownership of Bank, there would be no adverse effects on existing or potential 
competition nor would other area banks be adversely effected thereby. 

123 
-3-
Competitive considerations are consistent with approval of the application. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of Applicant are 
dependent upon those same conditions as they exist in Bank. The financial 
c°ndition of Bank is considered to be generally satisfactory in view of 
Applicant's commitment to provide Bank with additional equity capital. 
Managerial resources of Applicant and Bank are deemed to be satisfactory, 
an<l their prospects appear favorable. 
Banking factors are consistent 
with approval of the application. Although consummation of the transaction 
w°uld have no immediate effect on area banking needs, considerations relating 
t o the convenience and needs of the community are consistent with approval. 
It: is the Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the public 
interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
Reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order or 
(b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, unless 
S U ch period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve 
of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WYOMING BANCORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Wyoming Bancorporation, Cheyenne, Wyoming, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company 
Act, has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 80 per cent or more 
of the voting shares of First State Bank, Cody, Wyoming. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity 
for interested persons to submit comments and views, has 
been given in accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The 
time for filing comments and views has expired, and those 
received have been considered. The Board has considered 
the application in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls ten banks,^ holding total deposits 
of $120.9 million, representing 12.56 per cent of the total 
commercial deposits in Wyoming.-^ Consummation of the proposal 
herein would increase its proportion of State deposits by 1.4 
Per cent. 
Bank ($13.6 million in deposits) is the smaller of 
the two banking institutions in Cody (population 5,161), a 
community located in the northwestern portion of Wyoming. 
l7~By Orde^ofthisdate, the Board has approved Applicant's 
proposed acquisition of The First National Bank of Meeteetse, 
Meeteetse, Wyoming. Upon consummation of that acquisition, 
Applicant would control eleven banks. 
2/ Banking data are as of June 30, 1972. 

425 
-3-
Bank controls approximately 42 per cent of area deposits. 
From the facts of record, it appears that consummation of 
the proposed transaction would have no present or future 
adverse competitive effect on the banks in the market, but 
rather, should stimulate additional competition among them. 
Bank and Applicant's banking subsidiaries operate in 
separate banking markets and the closest banking office of 
Applicant to Cody is approximately 175 miles distant. 
It does 
not appear that existing competition would be eliminated by 
consummation of this proposal. Further, since Cody does not 
appear to be attractive as a de novo bank site, any potential 
for increased future competition between Applicant and Bank 
would appear to be precluded. On the basis of the foregoing, 
the Board concludes that the competitive considerations with 
respect to this transaction are consistent with approval of the 
application. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of 
Applicant, its subsidiary banks, and Bank are considered to 
be satisfactory; prospects for all, upon consummation, are 
favorable. 
It appears that Bank has generally satisfied the 
needs of the community. Applicant, however, proposes to assist 
in the internal operations of Bank and thereby to strengthen 
Bank's competitive posture. Accordingly, considerations relating 
to the convenience and needs of the community to be served are 

-2-
consistent with, and lend weight toward, approval of the applica-
tion. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the proposed 
acquisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
for the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be 
consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following 
the effective date of this Order or (b) later than three months 
after the effective date of this Order, unless such period is 
extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City pursuant to delegated authority.

Item No. 2 
2/8/73 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WYOMING BANCORPORATION 
Order Approvihg Acquisition of Bank Holding Company 
and Acquisition of Insurance Agency 
Wyoming Bancorporation, Cheyenne, Wyoming, has applied 
for the Board1s approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) of the indirect acquisition 
o f 88 per cent of the shares of The First National Bank of 
Meeteetse, Meeteetse, Wyoming ("Bank"). 
At the same time, Applicant has applied for the 
Board's approval under § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) 
§ 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y to acquire voting 
shares of First State Corporation, Cody, Wyoming ("Company"). 
Applicant states that Company would engage in the 
activities of a general insurance agency in a community that 
h as a population not in excess of 5,000 persons and that, 
although Company engages in the activities of a general 
^surance agency in one community of more than 5,000 persons, 
Company will limit its activities in that community, as 
described hereinafter, to conform to those activities which 
have been determined by the Board to be closeiy related to bank-
l a8 (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)). 
Notice of receipt of this application has been 
Published and the time for filing comments and views has 
Spired. The Board has considered the application in the 

-2-
light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(c)), and the considerations specified in § 4(c)(8) of 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). 
i / 
Applicant controls ten banks,- holding deposits of 
$120.9 million, representing 12.56 per cent of the total com-
mercial bank deposits in Wyoming. Consummation of the proposal 
herein would increase its proportion of State deposits by less 
than one per cent. 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1972.) 
Bank, a subsidiary of Company, is the only bank 
located in Meeteetse, a community of approximately 460 persons, 
a^d had deposits as of June 30, 1972 of approximately $1.6 million. 
Applicant1s subsidiary bank nearest to Bank is located approximately 
135 miles southwest of Meeteetse, and this distance appears to 
have precluded the development of competition between the two 
hanks. Bank is located 39 miles southeast of Cody where First 
state Bank, a proposed subsidiary of Applicant, is located. 
Although banks in Cody do compete in Meeteetse, Bank and First 
state Bank do not compete with each other due to their common 
ownership. In any case, Bank is not presently an aggressive 
competitor, having a loan-to-deposit ratio of 27.4 per cent. 
Consummation of the proposed transaction therefore will not 
S T B T Order of this date, the Board has approved Applicant s 
Proposed acquisition of First State Bank, Cody, Wyoming. 
uPon consummation of that acquisition, Applicant would control 
eleven banks. 

_ 429 
-3-
eliminate any existing competition; nor will consummation 
have an adverse effect on the development of competition 
in view of the absence of a probability that the common 
ownership of Bank and First State Bank will dissolve in the 
future and the lack of foreseeable economic or population 
growth of the Meeteetse area. 
Considerations relating to financial and managerial 
resources and prospects of Applicant and Bank appear to be 
satisfactory and consistent with approval. Bank's ultra-
conservative lending policies have limited the availability 
°f credit to residents of Meeteetse, forcing those residents 
t o turn to Cody banks to meet their credit needs. 
Consummation 
°f the proposed transaction should have the effect of liberalizing 
the lending policies of Bank in a reasonable manner. Accordingly, 
considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
communities involved support approval of the transaction. 
It 
is the Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the 
Public interest and that the application to acquire Bank should 
he approved. 
Company does a general insurance agency business as 
Linton Insurance Agency on the premises of Bank and as First 
State Insurance on the premises of First State Bank in Cody. 

Both agencies presently sell a variety of insurance coverage, 
including homeowners, automobile, fire, general liability, 
bonds, and other coverage. 
As indicated before, Meeteetse has a population 
°f 460. Linton Insurance Agency appears to compete with 
only one insurance agency in Meeteetse; that agency is 
Primarily engaged in the sale of automobile insurance coverage. 
Consummation of the proposed transaction is not expected to 
have any immediate effect on the operations of Linton Insurance • 
Agency, and Applicant is not engaged in a general insurance 
a8ency business in the Meeteetse area. The lack of growth 
in the Meeteetse area has been noted above. The Board con-
cludes that Applicant's acquisition of the general insurance 
agency operations of Linton Insurance Agency will not have an 
adverse effect on existing or future competition in the general 
insurance agency business in that area. The Board expects 
rather that, through its association with other insurance agencies 
l n Applicant's sytem, Linton Insurance Agency will be able to 
offer expanded insurance services and to represent larger 
insurance companies, thereby increasing competition in the 
general insurance agency business in Meeteetse and better serving 
the insurance needs of Meeteetse residents. 
Company initiated operations of First State Insurance 
in 1967 and has been permitted to continue its general insurance 
agency operations, despite Company's status as a bank holding 

company and the fact that the population of Cody (5,161 accord-
ing to the 1970 Census) exceeds 5,000, under the "grandfather" 
clause in section 4(a)(2) of the Act. However, "grandfather" 
rights may not be transferred, and Applicant, not having been 
engaged, directly or indirectly, in general insurance agency 
operations on June 30, 1968, may not 
acquire those rights. 
Applicant is aware of this and has agreed that, upon consummation 
of 
the proposed transactions, it will cease the general insurance 
sales activities of First State Insurance, initiate only sales 
insurance that the Board has by regulation and interpretation 
determined to be closely related to banking, and not to under-
take the renewal of any policy previously sold, the sale of 
Nhich would not be permitted by section 225.4(a)(9) of Reg-
ulation Y and the Board's interpretation of that section 
(12 CFR 225.120). This limitation of the activities of 
pirst State Insurance will eliminate First State Insurance as 
alternative source of general insurance services in Cody and 
m a y result in inconvenience to certain customers of First State 
Insurance. However, Cody is served by a number of general 
insurance agencies which together are capable of meeting and 
fulfilling the general insurance needs of Cody residents. The 
adverse effects of the proposed acquisition are minimal and 
are outweighed by the escpected ability of First State Insurance 

432 
-3-
deriving from its affiliation with Applicant to bring larger 
insurance underwriters into the Cody area and by the gains in 
efficiency which Applicant is expected to bring to its operations. 
The Board notes the legislative policy stated in the 
National Bank Act that national banks in communities of less 
than 5,000 persons may sell insurance (12 U.S.C. 92) and the 
Provisions of section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act 
Amendments of 1970 which prohibit banks from tying an extension 
°f credit to the purchase of insurance from the bank or its 
b ank holding company. The Board finds that approval of Appli-
cant's proposals to acquire the operations of Linton Insurance 
Agency, and to engage in insurance sales activities limited to 
those permissible under section 225.4(a)(9) of Regulation Y 
through the instrumentality of First State Insurance, is 
unlikely to result in any undue concentration of resources, 
decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, 
Unsound banking practices, or other significant adverse effects 
° n the public interest. Furthermore, in the Board's judgment, 
e benefits to the public resulting from approval of these 
Proposals lends weight to approval. On the basis of the fore-
8 o ing and other facts reflected in the record, the balance 
°f the public interest factors the 3oard must consider regard-
the acquisition of Company is favorable and the application 
should be approved. 

-3-
433 
On the basis of the record, the application is 
approved for the reasons summarized above. The acquisition 
of Bank shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth 
calendar day following the effective date of this Order or 
(b) later than three months after the effective date of this 
Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
°r by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City pursuant to 
delegated authority. The determination as to Company's 
insurance agency activities is subject to the Board's authority 
to require reports by, and make examinations of, holding com-
panies and their subsidiaries and to require modification or 
termination of the activities of a holding company or any of 
its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure com-
pliance with the provisions and purposes of the Act and the 
Board's regulations and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent 
evasions thereof.

WYOMING BANCORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Greeley 
Finance Company of Colorado 
Wyoming Bancorporation, Cheyenne, Wyoming, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act, has applied for the Board's approval, under § 4(c)(8) 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)), and § 225.4(b)(2) of the 
Board's Regulation Y, to acquire all of the voting shares of 
Greeley Finance Company of Colorado, Greeley, Colorado ("GFCC"), 
and thereby to indirectly acquire shares of The Greeley Finance 
Company and The Fort Collins Finance Company, both of which are 
^holly-owtleci subsidiaries of GFCC. The proposed subsidiary 
engages in the making and purchasing of consumer installment 
loans, the making of dealer floor plan loans, and the sale of 
credit life, health, and accident insurance, collision insurance 
° n the motor vehicles in which the subsidiary holds a security 
interest, and liability insurance, to its consumer debtors 
in conjunction with other insurance sold in connection with 
it <5 
motor vehicle loans. In addition, such insurance is sold 
t o consumer debtors on consumer installment loans purchased by 
tho 
subsidiary on a continuing basis from firms and individuals, 
e interval between the creation of the security interest and 
it 
s subsequent purchase by the subsidiary being minimal. Such 
activities have been determined by the Board to be closely related 
t o banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)). 

Notice of the application, affording opportunity 
for interested persons to submit comments and views on the 
Public interest factors, has been duly published (37 Federal 
Register 25573). The time for filing comments and views has 
expired and none has been received. 
Applicant controls ten b a n k s , h o l d i n g total deposits 
°f $120.9 million, representing 12.56 per cent of aggregate 
commercial bank deposits in Wyoming. 
(All banking data are 
as of June 30, 1972, unless otherwise indicated.) The banking 
subsidiaries, existing or proposed, of Applicant closest to 
GFCC's sole office are located in Cheyenne. Wyoming, fifty 
miles north of Greeley. 
GFCC, incorporated in 1962, held total loans outstanding 
°f approximately $8.3 million as of June 30, 1972, and its one 
office is located in Greeley. GFCC primarily engages in the 
business of a consumer finance company, specializing in auto-
mobile financing throughout the Greeley area. Applicant 
Presently has no consumer finance company subsidiary, nor any 
subsidiary located outside of Wyoming. Applicants three sub-
sidiary banks located in Cheyenne have made only an insignifcant 
amount of installment loans in the Greeley area. The absence of 
significant existing competition between GFCC and these banks

By separate Orders of this date, the Board has approved 
Applicant's proposed acquisitions of First State Bank, Cody, 
Wyoming, and of The First National Bank of Meeteetse, 
Heeteetse, Wyoming. Upon consummation of those acquisitions, 
Applicant would control twelve banks.

apparently is due to the considerable distance intervening 
between the lenders. GFCC lends to consumers who are considered 
bankable risks and is in competition with local area banks for 
direct consumer loans and dealer floor plan lending, as well 
as with local offices of national consumer finance companies 
for direct consumer loans. Thus, although GFCC is the largest 
independent finance company in Greeley, consummation of the 
Proposed transaction is not expected to adversely affect the 
development of future competition in Greeley. There is no 
Indication in the record that, absent approval of this pro-
posal, Applicant would enter de novo such lending operations 
In Greeley. On the basis of the facts of record, the elimina-
tion of existing or potential competition resulting from this 
Proposal appears minimal, and the Board considers the competitive 
considerations as consistent with approval of the application. 
It appears that consummation of this proposed trans-
action would not result in any undue concentration of resources, 
conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, or any other 
adverse effects on the public interest. However, the convenience 
the Greeley area would be enhanced by the improved and expanded 
lending operations resulting from the proposed affiliation. Com-
bination of the two organisations should also ensure management 
continuity of GFCC.

Based upon the foregoing and other considerations 
reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the 
balance of the public interest factors the Board is required 
to consider under § 4(c)(8) is favorable. Accordingly, the 
application is hereby approved. This determination is subject 
to the conditions set forth in § 225»4(c) of Regulation Y and 
to the Board's authority to require such modification or termina-
tion of the activities of a holding company or any of its sub-
sidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure compliance 
with the provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's 
regulations and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasion 
thereof.

2/8/73 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PALMER BANK CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Palmer Bank Corporation, Sarasota, Florida, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) 
to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors5 qualifying 
shares) of Gulf Gate Palmer Bank, Sarasota, Florida ("Bank"), a proposed 
new bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
5 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
the Board has considered the application and all comments received in light 
o f the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant, the twenty-first largest banking organization in Florida, 
c°ntrols four subsidiary banks with aggregate deposits of $147.5 million 
^Presenting 0.9 per cent of total commercial bank deposits within Florida. 
( A U banking data are as of June 30, 1972 adjusted to reflect bank holding 
company acquisitions and formations approved through December 31, 1972). 
Acquisition of the proposed new Bank will have no immediate effect on 
Applicant's share Q£ commercial bank deposits in the State. 
Since Bank is a proposed new bank, no existing competition would 
<be eliminated by consummation of the proposal nor would concentration be 
significantly increased in any relevant area. Bank would be located south of 
Sarasota and would be competing in the Sarasota,tarring market (approximated 
bV the City of Sarasota and surrounding environs), in which market Applicant 

442 
-3-
controls 37.3 per cent of deposits. Applicant's four subsidiary banks are 
located in the Sarasota area, the nearest being approximately 3.1 
miles northeast of the Bank. At the present time, there are five banking 
organizations in the Sarasota market, including three multi-bank holding 
companies controlling nine banks, one banking group controlling two 
banks, and one independent bank. Although Applicant is the largest banking 
°rganization in the market, it does not appear that consummation of the 
Proposal would confer a position of market dominance upon Applicant to the 
detriment of competing banks. The eighth and eleventh largest, banking 
°rganizations in Florida rank second and fourth in the Sarasota banking market 
ari(* control 35.6 and 7.8 per cent, respectively, of market deposits. It 
aPpears that approval of this proposal would not foreclose the opportunity 
for entry or growth by other banking organizations. The Board concludes 
t-bat competitive considerations are consistent with approval. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects of 
Applicant and its subsidiary banks are regarded as generally satisfactory. 
**ank, as a proposed new bank, has no financial or operating history; however, 
ito 
L S Prospects as a subsidiary of Applicant appear favorable and are consistent 
W i th approval of the application. 
It appears that the major banking needs of 
ttle area are being adequately served at the present time. However, Bank would 
ke able to provide an additional source of convenient banking services to the 
a t ea. Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the area to be 
Served are consistent with approval. 
It is the Board's judgment that the 
Proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
S h o u l d be approved. 

443 
-3-
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this Order 
(b) later than three months after that date, and (c) Gulf Gate Palmer Bank, 
Sarasota, Florida, shall be opened for business not later than six months after 
the effective date of this Order. Each of the periods described in (b) and (c) 
*ay be extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta pursuant to delegated authority.

dimmer, Sheehan and Bucher. Voting against this action: Governor Robertson. 

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
I do not concur with the majority in their approval of 
Applicant's proposal. 
I believe that, in the absence of an obvious 
Public need for additional banking services, the acquisition of a de novo 
bank by the largest banking organization in the Sarasota market will 
result in accentuating and firming concentration in this banking market 
and preclude deconcentration. 
Applicant, by virtue of the 37.3 per cent of market deposits 
which its four subsidiary banks hold, is the largest banking organization 
i n a market in which the two largest of the five banking organizations 
°Perating therein hold almost 73 per cent of the deposits. Any expansion 
by 
either of these two banking organizations should be subjected to the 
closest scrutiny under public interest standards. 
I would deny the application.

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20551 
Mr. Roy L. Ash, Director 
Executive Office of the President 
Office of Management and Budget 
Washington, Dc C, 20503 
Dear Mr * Ash: 
I am responding to Mr, Carlucci's letter of 
January 19, 1973, relating to the President's commitment to impose 
constraints which would require all agencies to hold both 
obligations and outlays to essential mini mums in 1973 and 19/4. 
Although a Government appropriation is not required to 
support the Board's operations, my colleagues and I fully support 
the President's determination to restrain the growth of Government 
expenditures, Our own budget formulation process and budget 
decisions this year reflect our determination to achieve maximum 
CiC.onof.iies consistent with fulfilling our statutory responsibilities* 
As is the case in the Executive Branch- the Board 
carefully formulated its plans for the 1973 calendar year budget, 
subjecting existing programs to close scrutiny to determine their 
need and effectiveness, and limiting new initiatives to those 
which are essential to the Board's mission. Further, in the 
Board's continuing strong desire to demonstrate responsible and 
prudent management of its operations, it intends during 1973 t;o 
review thoroughly its ongoing as we?1 as its proposed programs 
and activities for the purpose of identifying those which can be 
curtaiJed or eliminated„ 
The Board's preliminary estimate of $26,7 million for 
calendar year 1S73 was submitted to the Office of Management and 
Budget prior to full Board review in order to meet your publica-
tion deadlines* 
In accordance with instructions from your Office, 
that estimate did not include provision for a general pay increase 
nor did it have the benefit of a fine! Board review which would 

Mr. Roy L„ Ash 
« 2'.** 
take into consideration the additional resources required to 
support the Board's increasing functions sucli as the bank holdir 
company caseload* 
The Board's final budget of about $23 million 
including the GPI provision, represents an expenditure goal for 
1973 that: is 7*7% over 1972, 
Please be assured that we fully support the President' 
program and shall continue to maintain our posture of economical 
and effective use of resources. 
S i nee rely your s 3
