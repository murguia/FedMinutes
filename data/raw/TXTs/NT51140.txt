Insurance agency hearings. In a memorandum of November 20, 1973, 
Board Counsel recommended that the Board grant a request for a 20-day 
extension of time to file exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's 
recommended decision concerning certain bank holding company applications 
to engage in insurance agency activities in Florida. 
After discussion, the Board unanimously approved the extension 
°f time. A copy of the letter sent to counsel for the National Association 
°f Insurance Agents, Inc., is attached as Item No. 5. Similar letters 
were sent to other interested parties. 
Chase Manhattan Corporation—Dial Financial Corporation. In a 
Memorandum of November 14, 1973, the Division of Research and Statistics 
a
nd the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended denial of the 
a
Pplication of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, New York, to 
a c
quire shares of Dial Financial Corporation, Des Moines, Iowa. At its 
meeting on November 19, 1973, the Board deferred action on the application 
Pending exploration by the staff of several questions that were raised. 
After discussion at today's meeting, which included comments by 
Gelder of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, action was deferred 
Pending development by the staff of additional information. 
First National City Corporation—Advance Mortgage Corporation. 
^ 
its meeting on October 2, 1973, the Board considered further the 
a
Pplication of First National City Corporation, New York, New York, to

a i n shares of Advance Mortgage Corporation, Southfield, Michigan, and

instructed the staff to give additional study to certain aspects of 
the application. In a memorandum of November 1, 1973, the Division of 
Research and Statistics reaffirmed its recommendation of denial of the 
application. In a memorandum of November 13, 1973, the Legal Division 
provided a summary of the legislative background pertaining to the 
weaning of the term "undue concentration of resources" as used in the 
Bank Holding Company Act. 
After today's discussion, which included remarks by Mr. Gelder 
°f the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in support of that Bank's 
recommendation for approval, the Board denied the application, Governors 
ftaane and Sheehan dissenting on the grounds that benefits of the affiliation 
outweighed any possible adverse effects, including those associated with 
concentration of resources. It was understood that documentation reflecting 
this decision would be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
First Virginia Banlcshares. In a memorandum of October 18, 1973, 
the Division of Research and Statistics and the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation recommended approval of the application of First Virginia 
B
ankshares Corporation, Falls Church, Virginia, to acquire shares of 
Robert C. Gilkison, Inc., Washington, D. C., a firm offering investment 
a
dvisory services. 
After discussion, the Board approved the application, Governor 
r
immer dissenting because of the existence of covenants not to compete, 
a n
d authorized issuance of an order reflecting this decision. A copy of

the order is attached under Item No. 6, along with a copy of Governor 
Brimmer's dissenting statement. 
First National City Bank. 
In a memorandum of November 20, 19 73, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of the 
application of First National City Bank, New York, New York, to acquire 
shares of the following: 
1. C. G. Trinkaus & Burkhardt, Dusseldorf, Germany 
2. Grundstrucksgesellschaft Trinkausstrabe GmbH & Co., 
Dusseldorf, Germany 
3. Burkhardt & Co. Grundstucksgesellschaft, Essen, 
Germany 
4. Proventina Commercial AG, Zurich, Switzerland 
5. KKB Kundenkreditbank Kommanditgesellschaft Auf Aktien, 
Dusseldorf, Germany 
After discussion, the Board unanimously approved the application. 
A r> 
copy of the letter sent to the applicant is attached as Item No. 7. 
The meeting proceeded from this point with limited staff attendance, 
deluding Messrs. Feldberg, Allison, Melnicoff, Coyne, O'Connell, Burke, 
a n
d Althausen and Miss Brown. 
Proposed building for Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. At its 
m e e
t i n g on November 7, 1972, the Board approved a schematic design, a 
r G
vi s ecl space program, and a revised project budget, which constituted 
first phase of a proposed building for the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond. 
In a memorandum of November 19, 1973, the Committee on Federal 
Re 
s e
r v e Bank Activities recommended that the Board disapprove the next 
Phase in the building program, design development of the building as 
Presently proposed, and that the Board direct the Richmond Bank to have 
•.1 e
 building redesigned to eliminate certain objectionable features.

At today's meeting there was general agreement on the Committee's 
objections to the proposed design. Discussion focused on whether, in 
light of its approval of the first phase in November 1972, the Board 
should now suggest that the building be redesigned. 
The meeting then recessed and reconvened at 2:00 p.m. in the 
Board Room with Chairman Burns and Governors Mitchell, Daane, Brimmer, 
Sheehan, Bucher, and Holland present and the same staff attendance as 
a
t the conclusion of the morning session. 
Further discussion of the Richmond building program developed 
a
 consensus that before taking action on the design development phase, 
Chairman Burns and Governor Sheehan would consult with representatives 
o f
 the Richmond Bank at which time the Board's concern would be presented. 
Governor Brimmer, however, expressed a preference for the Board's acting 
today to approve the design development phase, since he believed that 
the Board's November 1972 action committed it to approval of subsequent 
Phases of the building program. 
The meeting then adjourned.

November 21, 1973 
The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
Chairman 
Subcommittee on Bank Supervision and Insurance 
Committee on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I am writing in response to your request for the Board's views on 
H. R. 7927, a bill broadening the powers of national banks to make 
real estate loans. 
As you noted, language identical to this bill was contained in 
H. R. 16704, the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1972, which 
did not pass in the 92d Congress. 
A bill similar to H. R. 7927, 
s
* 2175, has been introduced in the Senate. 
The Board believes it is desirable to provide national banks with 
sufficient flexibility in making real estate loans to meet the 
h a n g i n g needs of consumers for both residential and non-residential 
Mortgage credit. 
However, in order to safeguard the banks and con-
sumers from the use of such devices as "balloon payment" notes in 
connection with loans secured by real estate, the Board has con-
sistently supported provisions, such as in subsection "(g)", which 
v
°uld authorize the Comptroller of the Currency to establish safe-
guards by regulation should this become advisable. 
The Board thus 
no objection to enactment of H . R* 7927. 
The Board prefers, nevertheless, the alternative approach of deleting 
the entire § 24 from the Federal Reserve Act and substituting the 
following sentence: 
"Any national banking association may make loans 
°
n
 the security of real estate to the extent authorized by regulations 
prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency." 
I n
 the field of real estate loans, the ground rules have changed so 
m u c
-h in the past tew decades that the existing § 24 has become obso-
l o t
e i n s o m c respects, and any amendment which specifies restrictions 
t a a
y become obsolete quickly. 
The approach we suggest would provide 
supervisory authority primarily responsible for the safety and 

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
Page Two 
4589 
soundness of national banks with greater flexibility, while at the 
same time allowing for protection of the public interest. 
This 
approach also recognizes that real estate loans to one class of 
borrowers, such as home buyers, may require a different set of rules 
than would apply to more sophisticated borrowers, such as home 
builders. 
Finally, we recommend that a provision appearing in S. 2175 be 
included in H. R. 7927. 
In accordance with a long-standing Board 
proposal, S. 2175 repeals the last sentence of § 10(b) of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 347b). Section 10(b) authorizes Federal Re-
serve Banks to extend credit to member banks secured simply by col-
lateral regarded as satisfactory by the Reserve Banks. But extensions 
°f credit under § 10(b) must be made at a penalty rate at least one-
half of one per cent higher than the discount rate. This contrasts 
w
ith the lending provisions of § 13 of the Act, which allows Reserve 
Banks to extend credit to member banks at the discount rate if the 
credit extensions are secured by "eligible paper" or certain other 
limited types of assets. 
The result of this ancient distinction between "eligible" and "in-
e
ligible" paper is that many sound member bank loans cannot qualify 
as security for Federal Reserve advances except at the penalty rate 
o f
 at least one-half per cent above the discount rate fixed in the 
last sentence of § 10(b). Among the types of currently "ineligible" 
Paper are loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Admin-
istration and the Veterans Administration. Allowing such assets to 
used as collateral on credit obtained at the discount rate would 
enhance the attractiveness of such paper and tend to encourage mem-
b e
r banks to increase their holdings of these obligations. 
To prevent abuses, the Board would retain the authority to prescribe 
.limitations on the extensions of such credit by the Reserve Banks. 
therefore recommend the addition of the following language at 
li
-ne 18, page 8: 
• « . 
"Sec. 2. The last sentence of § 1.0(b) of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 347b) is repealed." 
Board appreciates the opportunity you have afforded us to comment 
°
n
 H. R. 7927. 
We hope our comments will prove helpful to you and 
other members of the Subcommittee. 
Sincerely yours, 
Arthur F. Burns

F&M NATIONAL CORPORATION 
Order Denying Acquisition of Virginia Loan and Thrift 
Corporation 
F&M National Corporation, Winchester, Virginia, a bank holding 
c
°nipany within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
f o
* the Board's approval, under § 4(c)(8) of the Act and § 225.4(b)(2) 
o f
 the Board's Regulation Y , to acquire all of the voting shares of 
V i r
8inia Loan and Thrift Corporation, Winchester, Virginia ("Company"), 
a c

l 0 a n s 
a n d
 purchasing consumer installment sales finance contracts, en-
gaging i n

c o n g u m e r finance business, selling credit life and 
health and accident insurance to borrowers, and conducting other 
ai
*cial activities as permitted by the Code of Virginia as it pertains 
industrial loan associations. 
Such activities have been determined 
t h e
 Board to be closely related to banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(1), (2) 
and 
( 9 ) K 
Notice of 
the application, affording opportunity for interested 
submit comments and views on the public interest factors, has

°larke), Applicant's bank* Farmers and Merchants National Bank ("Bank"), 
Winchester, Virginia, is dominant, controlling approximately 44 per cent 
o f
 total market deposits. The second largest bank controls approximately 
Per cent of the market deposits; and the remaining four banks control 
32 
Per cent in the aggregate, 
(All banking data are as of June 30, 1972, 
U n l e s s
 otherwise noted.) 
Company (assets of $2.3 million as of June 30, 1973), one of

n l y f
*
V e
 industrial loan associations chartered by the State of 
V i r
8 i n i a , issues uninsured "certificates of investment" to fund the making 
f
 consumer installment loans and the purchasing of consumer installment 
n
ce contracts. Company also sells credit life and credit health and 
ccident insurance to borrowers. 
Its sole office is located in 
C h e s t e r , Virginia. 
The relevant product markets for considering the competitive 
the proposed acquisition appear to be those for consumer loans 
a n d
 thrift- ^ 
deposits; the relevant geographic market for these activities 
ia 
a
P P r o x i m a t e l y the same as the b a n k i n g m a r k e t in w h i c h B a n k c o m p e t e s . 
B a n k
 had « 
outstanding consumer installment loans of the types made by 
c
°l8umer f4 
*inanee companies of $9.6 million, representing about 39 per 
°
ent
 of 
c 
consumer installment loans held by commercial banks in the rele-
vant 
a r k e
t , and thrift deposits of $34.8 million representing 32.1 per 
c
*nt o f 
. 
^ 
cnose held by banks and nonbanks in the market. 
In addition to 
* Applicant operates two finance companies in Winchester, a subsidiary, 

4 5 9 2 
-3-
Winchester Credit Corporation ("Credit"), and its subsidiary, Rouss 
Finance Company ("Finance"). Credit and Finance hold about 32 per cent 
o f
 the consumer installment loans held by nonbanking offices in the rele-
n t market. Company had outstanding consumer loans of $1.5 million 
^Presenting about 25 per cent of those held by nonbanks in the relevant 
r k
e t , and 1.4 per cent of market thrift deposits held by banks and 
n
°nbanks. 
The market for consumer loans is concentrated, with the three 
l a r
gest lenders holding about 83 per cent of outstanding consumer loans. 
PProval of the proposed acquisition would increase this three-firm 
n c
entration to approximately 88 per cent and would reduce the number 
of 
competing consumer loan lenders from 12 to 11. Furthermore, existing 
petition between Applicant (the largest consumer loan lender in the 
markets 
and Company (the fourth largest consumer loan lender) would be 
^i^inated 
A 
. 
i 
u
> and Applicant's market share of consumer loans would increase 
^ o m 30 
0
 Per cent to 43 per cent. 
The market for thrift deposits is concentrated, with the top 
t h t e e
 firmfl u i 
holding almost 75 per cent of thrift deposits. Approval of 
Pr 
s
ed acquisition would increase this three-firm concentration to 
Per C G 
t 
and would reduce the number of competitors in the market from 
e l g h t
 to 
fie 
even. Existing competition between Applicant (ranked first in 
i f t
 depo 
Posits) and Company (ranked seventh) would be eliminated, and 
p p l
l e a n t
1
s market share would increase from 32.1 per cent to 33.5 per 

4533 
-4-
c
ent. The Board concludes that consummation of the proposal would have a 
substantially adverse effect on existing competition in both product 
markets. 
Virginia law prohibits the chartering of any new industrial loan 
i n
stitutions, such as Company, which can obtain funds through the issuance 
f\ € 
certificates of investment. While Applicant would be effectively unable 
t o
 form an industrial loan association de novo, Applicant's bank and non-
inking subsidiaries can offer all of the important lending services 
Provided by Company. Applicant's proposed acquisition of Company would 
e l i l
&inate Company as a possible foothold acquisition by a State-wide 
a n
H n g organization not presently represented in this market or as an 
^isition by a nonbank financial company, and would further entrench 
Pplio 
i 
A
cant s dominant position. The Board concludes that consummation 
V 0 u l d . 
»ave a substantially adverse effect on potential competition. 
Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act requires the 
t-
1 : 0
 find that performance by Company as an affiliate of Applicant 
a n
 reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public such as 
heater

 convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that 
*t>n possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of re-
8
°urCe 
a
> decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound 
8 Practices". 
In seeking to meet its burden of demonstrating that 
a
c q u i s i t i o n would be in the public interest, Applicant indicates that 
C i o n
 would strengthen Company's competitive ability. 
While 
°
0tI1
Paixv a 
* uoes have a problem of successor management which Applicant is 

4594 
-5-
capable of solving, Company's earnings are good and there would appear to 
b e
 less anticompetitive solutions to the problem than affiliation with 
Applicant. Applicant also submitted anticipated reductions in rates charged 
b y c
°ropany. While those anticipated rate reductions promise some public 
benefit, based on the foregoing and other considerations reflected in the 
r e
cord, the Board finds that the public benefits to be derived from the 
Proposed acquisition do not outweigh the substantially adverse competitive 
G f
£ e c t s of the proposal. Accordingly, the application is hereby denied.

. New York Branch 
375 Park Avenue 
New York, New York 
10022 
Dear Mr. van Aggelen: 
By letter of October 17, you requested that the Board 
establish a special reserve-free base of $50 million to permit your 
head office to fund the newly opened New York branch up to this amount 
without maintaining marginal reserve deposits as requested in Chairman 
turns' letter of June 1, 1973. 
The Board has recognized that as a matter of equity minimum 
deserve-free bases are appropriate in the case of branches that were 
not opened and operating in May 1973. Accordingly, for banking insti-
tutions that did not have substantial historical bases of time deposits 
and certain other specified liabilities, the Board established a 
minimum reserve-free base of $10 million. And similarly in the case 
newly opened branches the request has been administered to apply 
the marginal reserve deposit against net borrowings from banks abroad 
^ excess of $10 million. 
The Board considers that uniform application of this arrange-
ment will best ensure equitable treatment of both U.S. and foreign-owned 
hanking institutions. Accordingly, it is not prepared to make an 
G X c
e p t i o n in the case of your bank. 
The Board recognizes that the request for marginal reserve 
deposits involves a voluntary recognition of U.S. monetary objectives 
ari(1
 it appreciates the cooperation of your bank and other foreign-
°Wned banking institutions in this program of credit restraint. 
Yours truly,

First National City Overseas Investment 
Corporation

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of September 20, 1973, the 
Board of Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("FNCOIC") 
to purchase and hold, directly or indirectly, 49 per cent of the 
shares of Valores Mexicanos, S.A. ("VM"), Mexico City, Mexico, at 
a
 cost of approximately $40,000, provided the shares are acquired 
within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
°f shares of VM by FNCOIC is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) That FNCOIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly 
any shares of stock in VM if VM at any time fails 
to restrict its activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act 
could, with the consent of the Board of Governors, 
purchase and hold stock, or if VM establishes 
any branch or agency or takes any action or under-
takes any operation in Mexico or elsewhere, in any 
manner, which at the time would not be permissible 
to FNCOIC; 
(2) That, when requested by the Board of Governors, 
FNCOIC will furnish the Board with such reports 
regarding the activities of VM as it may require 
from time to time; and 

4537 
-2-
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by VM be 
reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in 
the same manner as if VM were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as 
they relate to restrictions on loans granted by VM in Mexico in 
the currency of that country. 
You have requested consent for VM to engage in the busi-
ness of underwriting or dealing in securities. The Board's consent 
to such activities is conditioned upon your Corporation's obtaining 
the prior consent of the Board for the continued holding of shares 
of VM should VM acquire stock of individual issuers costing in ex-
cess of $500,000 or representing 25 per cent or more of the voting 
shares of any company, except in the case of underwriting operations 
covered by firm commitments from subunderwriters or other purchasers. 
With respect to trading in securities in which Corporations are 
prohibited from investing by the provisions of the eighth paragraph 
of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board's consent is 
further conditioned on the fact that VM will acquire such shares 
only as dealer or underwriter, maintain a size and turnover of in-
ventory that is reasonable in relation to demand, and dispose of 
s
^ch shares within a reasonable time. 
In this connection, shares acquired as a dealer need not 
he reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K. However, they 
a r
e to be reported as a separate class, together with the date of 
acquisition, on any Call Report of Condition or similar report 
requested by the Board. 
In granting this consent, the Board understands that the 
shares of any mutual fund for which VM is to provide management 
services will be sold only to nonresident aliens of the United States 
a n
d that such funds will not directly or indirectly control or 
Participate in the management of any company. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is re-
quested that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, 
Memorandum of Association, and By-Laws of VM. 

-2-
4598 
The foregoing consent is given on the condition that the 
investment will be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint 
Guidelines as they apply to First National City Bank and its 
affiliates. 
Very truly yours

Dear Mr. Marks: 
The Board has considered your motion filed on behalf of 
the National Association of Insurance Agents, Inc. and related 
Parties ("NAIA") for an extension of time until December 17, 1973 
t o
 file exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's Recommended 
decision on the five bank holding company applications to engage 
ir
i insurance agency activities in Florida (Docket Nos. IA-3, IA-6, 
IA--12, and 1A-13). No written opposition to the motion has 
been filed and in view of the length of the record, the Board believes 
that your request for an extension of time for filing exceptions is 
n
°t unwarranted. 
Accordingly, the Board has granted an extension 
o f
 time to NAIA and to all other parties for the filing of exceptions 
to the Administrative Law Judge's Recommended Decision. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Theodore E. Allison

Company commenced business as a sole proprietorship in

located 
within the Washington, D. C., SMSA, which approximates

a
PProximates $37 million, a great number of its clients are individual 
investors whose portfolios are not large by industry standards. 
In 
v
iew of the relative size of Company, the number and size of its 
c
°n>Petitors, and other facts of record, the Board considers that 
th 
e
 Proposed acquisition would not eliminate any significant existing 
competition. 
There is no evidence in the record that consummation 
of 
n e
 Proposed acquisition would lead to undue concentration 
f
 resources, unfair competition, conflicts of interest, unsound 
n
8 practices, or other adverse effects. Access to Applicant's 
data Processing facilities may enable Company to improve both 
t h e
 quality and extent of its services; and affiliation with 
App]^ a
n t will insure continuity of management in Company should 
itg 
Present officers ever become unavailable. 
In its consideration of subject proposal, the Board has 
ered Applicant's expression of purpose to enter into employment 
contfn c t
8 , each including a covenant not to compete, with Company's 
Principal officer-shareholders. 
Covenants not to compete often 
p r e

 Board will scrutinize the facts in each case to determine whether 
Particular employment contracts and accompanying covenants not to 
c

pl

and that 
> subject to the above restrictions, each covenantee would be 
e
e to 
engage in the investment advisory business at any geographic 
°cation 
a
t any time. Having reviewed the details of the covenants 
to 
Compete proposed by Applicant, the Board find 3 that their pro-

consistent with the public interest, and the existence

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I would disapprove the application by First Virginia Bankshares 
C
°rporation to acquire Robert C. Gilkison, Inc. My decision is based on 
t h e
 existence of covenants not to compete in proposed employment contracts 
between Applicant and Gilkison Company's two principal officer-shareholders 
Th 
e
 proposed covenants would limit competition between these individuals 
a n d
 Gilkison Company for a period of five years after each of them leaves 
t h e
 company's employ. 
My reasons for disapproving covenants not to compete have been 
s t
ated fully in several Dissenting Statements in the past."^ j n general, 
1
 disapprove such covenants because they invariably result in a lessening 
of 
competition--a result that is inconsistent with the public interest 
thua in conflict with the standards of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
a c
ting upon an application under § 4(c)(8) of the Act, the Board must 
t e
tmine whether the acquisition can reasonably be expected to produce 
k®tief it 
t s
 to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, 
g Q
ins in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as 
C r
eased or unfair competition; and the Board must deny any application 
** which possible adverse effects are not outweighed by public benefits.

The present case is the first in which the Board has considered 
a
 covenant not to compete incident to acquisition of an investment advisor 
firm. However, in my judgment, such covenants are no less objectionable 
h e r
e than they were in previous cases. The lessening of competition that 
result from the proposed covenants is not outweighed by other public 
interest considerations presented in the application. 
Accordingly, 
T 
w
°uld deny the application.
