Discount rates. The establishment without change by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Boston on February 26 and by the Federal Reserve 
Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco on 
February 29, 1968, of the rates on discounts and advances in their 
existing schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that appropriate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
Edge corporations. 
Governor Robertson referred to the discus-
sion at the meeting on February 15, 1968, at which time the Board 
approved the establishment of two Edge corporations in which more than 
one bank would have an interest. He presented the question whether, 
as suggested by some of the comments at that meeting, it was desired 
to issue a press release on multibank Edge corporations and also on 
the Board's policy restricting investments by Edge or agreement corpo-
rations in the developed countries of continental Western Europe. 
He 
read a draft of press release that might be issued for those purposes, 
but indicated that he was inclined against the issuance of such a 

3/1/68 
-3-
release on the grounds that it was not necessary. He noted that the 
matter of investments in Western Europe had been referred to in an 
earlier press release. 
There appeared to be general agreement that no further press 
release regarding investments in Western Europe was necessary. As to 
the matter of a press release on multibank Edge corporations, members 
of the Board indicated that they would like to consider the question 
on the basis of a background memorandum from the staff. 
Accordingly, 
i l w a s
 understood that such a memorandum would be prepared. 
Mr. Molony stated that the press had been asking for a copy of 
the letter received by the Board from the Department of Justice with 
regard to multibank Edge corporations, and he was authorized to comply 
with any such requests. 
Regional check clearing facility. It was understood that avail-
able members of the Board would meet next Tuesday afternoon with First 
Vice President Heflin and Vice President Black of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Richmond to discuss informally, before the proposal was sub-
mitted to the Bank's Board of Directors, some of the critical issues 
that appeared to be involved in the plan of the Bank to establish a 
regional check clearing facility in the Washington metropolitan area. 
Copies of a report from the Bank describing the project had been made 
available to the members of the Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.
