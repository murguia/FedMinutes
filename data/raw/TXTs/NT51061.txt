Possible Talking Points Re Recent Banking Developments 
Despite various measures instituted by the Federal Reserve 
System to restrain the availability of bank credit, data 
submitted by commercial banks reveal that bank loans to 
business customers are continuing to rise at an unacceptably 
rapid rate. 
The current situation is disturbing, moreover, because a 
number of commercial banks are not showing sufficient 
indication of modifying their attitudes and their policies 
on lending to make them consistent with the national interest. 
For example, apparently in the case of some banks, senior 
management has issued no orders to lending officers caution-
ing them to go slow in soliciting new loan accounts. 
Nor 
have loan review committees been charged with the task of 
screening loans with a view to moderating the rate of loan 
expansion. 
^* Those banks that are failing to adjust their lending policies 
to make them consistent with the national interest appear to 
be operating on the assumption that they will be able to 
obtain an unlimited supply of lendable funds from the issuance 
of CD's and other time deposits, or from other liability 
sources, and that they will be able to pass on the cost of 
these funds to borrowers in any event. 
This business-as-usual stance currently manifested by a number 
banks appears to be the outgrowth of an over-emphasis of 
the importance of expanding profits which have characterized 
the management attitude of some banks in recent years. 
This 
over-emphasis on the profit goal has been demonstrated in 
reports presented by the senior management of some banks to 
stockhold ers and security analysts. 
6, o 
m e bankers currently appear to have an insufficient 
?;PPreciation of the special status of the banking business0 
^ ey fail to give enough stress to the importance of main-
taining public confidence in the banking system and to the 
^ey role played by banks in insuring the stability and health 
ot the economy. They violate the spirit of Government regu-
ations as well as the general requirement for responsible 
conduct which Congress has assigned to those engaged in the 
inking business.

Possible Talking Points Re Constructive 
i^tions Member Banks Might Take Under Present Circumstances 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Member banks have a responsibility for conducting their 
affairs in a manner which insures not only the soundness 
and stability of their own institutions but also the 
stability and health of the community. 
Satisfying all customer requests for credit, and indeed 
seeking out new loan business during a period in which 
the economy is expanding too rapidly and prices rising 
^acceptably, represents a clear failure to live up to 
that responsibility. 
Most bankers would agree that the rate of growth in business 
loans in recent months has been inordinately strong. 
There 
xs a clear need for a reduction in the rate of bank'loan 
expansion. Accomplishing this task in an equitable and 
effective manner will require each banker to do his part. 
To achieve the needed moderation in bank loan growth without 
eiying on the discipline imposed by a severe tightening in 
general credit conditions will require bank management to 
evelop voluntarily an internal machinery for restraining 
ne expansion of loans to the banks' customers. 
Approaches 
inular to the following might serve this objective well: 
(a) 
(b) 
<c) 
Establish target levels of moderate growth*for 
various loan categories--including categories 
for small businesses, consumers and home buyers--
and stress the need to stay within these levels. 
Review by the Board of Directors and/or the Chief 
Executive Officer of the bank should be performed 
frequently to insure conformance with these targets 
and, if necessary, to make any needed adjustments. 
In order to insure that loan growth remains within 
targeted levels, it might prove helpful to set 
down more specific and tighter guidelines for 
senior loan officers and to require them to 
obtain approval from senior management before 
making certain types of loans (or loan commitments) 
making loans in excess of particular amounts.

(1) For example, if approval of the Board of 
- . , 
Directors or Chief Executive Officer is 
presently required on loan agreements (or 
commitments) in excess of $1 million, that 
figure might be lowered to $500,000. 
(2) Requests for loans to finance corporate 
acquisitions or speculation in securities 
or real estate should be screened even 
more vigorously than usual. 
Prudence should be observed in the issuance of large CD's 
funds p u r c h Z s ? 3 f r° m n ° n d e p O S i t
