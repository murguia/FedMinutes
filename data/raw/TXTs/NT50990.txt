Discount rate. 
On November 16, 1972, the Board of Directors 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had acted to establish, 
subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, a rate 
4-3/4 per cent (an increase from 4-1/2 per cent) on discounts for 
a
n d advances to member banks under sections 13 and 13a of the Federal 
Reserve Act, together with appropriately corresponding subsidiary rates 
advances under other sections of the Act. The reasons for the proposed 
increase were stated in a telegram received from the Kansas City Bank, 
which read in part as follows: 

11/20/72 
-2-
"The action was based wholly on the economic 
case for an increase. However, this Board recognizes 
the possibility that an increase might contribute to 
or be blamed for a rise in short-term rates which in 
turn could result in strong pressures to extend con-
trols to interest rates. This Board would consider 
the extension of controls to interest rates as more 
harmful than a delay in the discount rate increase 
but feels the Board of Governors is better able to 
make this judgment." 
Discussion indicated that the Board favored disapproval of the 
proposed increase. The Board reviewed information indicating that 
spreads between the discount rate and key money markets rates had not 
widened in recent weeks and in fact had narrowed in some instances. 
The 
Board also took note of sizable recent declines in most long-term interest 
rates and the continued moderate rate of growth in bank reserves and the 
monetary aggregates. 
It concluded that an increase in the discount 
r
ate in these circumstances would probably be viewed as leading rather 
tha n following the market and would tend to foster higher interest rates 
a t
 a time when markets were already experiencing seasonal demand pressures. 
In this connection, the view was expressed that under current circum-
stances any tightening in monetary policy should be accomplished initially 
through open market operations rather than through the discount rate. 
It was also suggested that an increase in the discount rate 
would probably be regarded as inconsistent with the activities of the 
Committee on Interest and Dividends, which was urging commercial banks 
to exercise restraint in setting their lending rates. Additionally, a 

3278 
11/20/72 
-3-
rise in the discount rate under prevailing conditions would augment 
pressures in Congress to impose mandatory controls on interest rates. 
While agreeing that a rise in the discount rate would not be 
timely, some members of the Board expressed concern about the rise in 
member bank borrowings during recent weeks. That rise appeared to be 
related at least in part to the slightly higher costs of borrowing 
funds in the market. 
It was observed, for example, that the average 
level of the Federal funds rate was currently 1/4 to 3/8 percentage 
Point above the discount rate. Sentiment in favor of reviewing the 
Board's discount rate policy was indicated in the event that member 
bank borrowings should rise further. 
After brief further consideration, the Board voted unanimously 
t o
 disapprove the proposed increase in the discount rate. 
It was 
Agreed that a letter outlining the reasons for the disapproval would be 
drafted and sent to the Kansas City Bank after review by the individual 
Members of the Board. 
It was also agreed that the substance of the 
letter, without identification of the Reserve Bank involved, would be 
communicated to all the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents. A copy of 
letter subsequently sent to the Kansas City Bank and a copy of the 
memorandum sent to the BanK Presidents, both dated November 21, are 
a t
tached as Items 1 and 2. 
Other discount rates. The establishment without change by the 
federal Reserve Bank of Boston on November 13 and by the Federal Reserve 

3 2 7 7 
11/20/72

Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco on 
November 16, 1972, of the rates on discounts and advances in their 
existing schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that appropriate advice would be sent to those Banks.

First Credit Corporation, with offices in Shallotte and Wilmington, 
North Carolina, and authorized the issuance of an order reflecting 
that decision. A copy of the order is attached as Item No. 9. 
The Board unanimously approved a recommendation by the Legal 
Division in a memorandum dated November 15, 1972, that the non-confi-
dential portions of registration statements (F.R. Y-5) and annual 
reports (F.R. Y-6) of bank holding companies be released to the public 
when requested. 
A proposed report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
the competitive factors involved in the proposed acquisition of 
assets and assumption of liability to pay deposits made in The Berwick 
Bank, Berwick, Pennsylvania, by United Penn Bank, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania, was removed from the consent calendar, because Governor Sheehan 
had requested additional information. 
This concluded consideration of the consent calendar. 
Divestiture review. 
In a memorandum dated November 13, 1972, 
the Banking Markets Section recommended that the Board approve an 
exemption from section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act relating to 
n
°nbanking activities for several bank holding companies. 
In response to a question by Governor Brimmer it was noted that 
since the requested exemptions had not been published for comment, it 
W a
s not necessary to publish the Board's determination. 
However, it 
Was suggested that in the future whenever bank holding company matters 

3280 
11/20/72 
-7-
were published for comment, notice of the Board's determination should 
also be published. The Board expressed agreement with the suggestion. 
The Board thereupon approved an exemption from section 4 of 
the Bank Holding Company Act relating to nonbanking activities for 
the following bank holding companies: Amalgamated Clothing Workers of 
America, New York, New York; International Union, United Mine Workers 
of America, Washington, D. C.; Globe Corporation, Scottsdale, Arizona; 
Denebeim Bros., San Francisco, California; Lykes Bros. Inc., Tampa, 
Flo rida; Mickler Corporation, Tampa, Florida; Miami Corporation, 
Chicago, Illinois; Wirtz Corporation, Chicago, Illinois; Cummins-Amer-
ican Corp., Glenview, Illinois; Riley Company, Inc., East Chicago, 
Indiana; Ruan Financial Corporation, Des Moines, Iowa; Security Invest-
ment Company, Kansas City, Kansas; Wm. T. Burton Industries, Inc., 
Sulphur, Louisiana; Atlantic Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts; Stupp 
Bros. Bridge and Iron Co., Lemay, Missouri; and Bessemer Securities 
Corporation, New York, New York. 
A copy of the letter sent to United Mine Workers of America 
is attached as Item No. 10; a similar letter was sent to Amalgamated 
Clothing Workers of America. A copy of the letter sent to Bessemer 
Securities Corporation is attached as Item No. 11; similar letters were 
S e
n t to the other bank holding companies. 
Chase Manhattan Corporation. The Board approved, Governor Brimmer 
di s senting, the application of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, 

3 2 8 1 
11/20/72 
-8-
New York, to acquire shares of Chase Manhattan Bank of the Mid-Hudson 
(Nat ional Association), Saugerties, New York, successor by merger to 
The Saugerties National Bank and Trust Company, and authorized issuance 
°f an order reflecting that decision. A copy of the order is attached 
a s
 Item No. 12. Governor Brimmer dissented for the reasons set forth 
in his dissenting statement with respect to approval of the application 
°f First National City Corporation, New York, New York, to acquire the 
successor by merger to The National Exchange Bank of Castieton-on-Hudson, 
New York (order dated July 7, 1972). 
Regulation A . 
In a memorandum dated October 26, 1972, the 
Board recommended publication for comment of a revised Regulation A , 
Advances and Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks. Attached to the 
memorandum were drafts of a press release, an explanatory letter to the 
Reserve Banks, and a suggested Reserve Bank letter to member banks. 
At today's meeting several questions were raised about the 
Proposed letter to member banks, and it was agreed not to send the 
letter at this time. Continuing discussion included several suggestions 
for revision of the draft press release. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the Board unanimously 
improved publication for comment of the revised Regulation A , with 
comments to be received by February 28, 1973, and a revised press release. 

3282 
11/20/72 
-9-
Copies of the press release and the Federal Register notice regarding 
the Regulation are attached under Item No. 13. A letter was sent to 
the Federal Reserve Banks in the form attached as Item No. 14. 
Report on competitive factors. The Board approved, for trans-
mittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a report on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of The Peoples 
National Bank of Barre, Barre, Vermont, with First Vermont Bank and 
Trust Company, Brattleboro, Vermont, the conclusion reading as follows: 
There is little, if any, competition presently existing 
between First Vermont Bank and Trust Company, Brattleboro, 
and The Peoples National Bank of Barre. The proposed merger 
would have the effect of introducing for the first time a 
large southern based bank into the northern sector of the 
State. Consummation of the proposal would have no adverse 
competitive effects. 
Governors Robertson, Brimmer, and Bucher felt that the effect 
°f the proposed merger on competition would be slightly adverse. 
Retirement and Thrift Plans. 
In a memorandum dated November 15, 
1^72, Governor Bucher recommended that the Board approve several proposed 
a
mendments to the Retirement and Thrift Plans for Federal Reserve employ-
e s and an increase in the post-retirement group life insurance for 
e
ligible persons who retire on or after January 1, 1973. The recommended 
actions, which would relate specifically to provisions affecting employ-
e s at the Federal Reserve Banks rather than at the Board, would be 
sub-
l e t to favorable determinations by the Internal Revenue Service that 
the Plans would continue to qualify for tax benefits under the Revenue 

3283 
11/20/72 
-10-
Code. January 1, 1973, was suggested as the effective date for the 
changes, which among other things included a revision of the Bank Plan 
pension formula, improvement in early retirement benefits, and intro-
duction of a less-than-actuaria1 discount for a joint survivorship 
option for certain long-service employees. 
Attached to Governor Bucher's memorandum was a letter of 
October 27, 1972, from Mr. Heflin, Chairman of the Administrative Boards 
°f the Retirement, Thrift, and Insurance Plans for Employees of the 
Federal Reserve System, describing briefly each of the proposals. 
In 
his memorandum Governor Bucher commented on the costs of the proposed 
changes in the Retirement Plan, which would involve an increase in 
accrued liabilities of $29,735,000 and an increase in the annual 
maintenance costs of approximately $1,110,000. These costs would not 
result in an addition to the expense budgets of the Reserve Banks 
during the coming year, however, since they would be met by allocations 
°f surplus reserves presently held in the Retirement Plan. One of 
Governor Bucher's recommendations was that, if the Board looked favorably 
u
Pon these proposed improvements in benefits, all Reserve Bank employees 
s
cheduled for retirement before the end of 1972 be given an opportunity 
t o
 delay their retirement until January 1, 1973, in order to obtain the 
^proved level of benefits. 
During discussion of the proposed changes, Governor Brimmer 
inquired whether consideration had been given to the possibility of 

32Qi 
11/20/72 
-11-
adopting a three-year final average salary as a base for computing 
Pension benefits under the Bank Plan, in place of the present five-year 
average. Governor Bucher's response was to the effect that this had 
been considered but that since there was virtually no precedent for 
less than a five-year final average salary as a pension base except 
m strictly governmental plans, the System Committee on Employee 
benefits concluded that for the present the five-year period should be 
r
etained in the Bank Plan. Governor Brimmer then expressed the view 
that in general he favored moving the benefits for Reserve Bank employees 
closer to those afforded under the Civil Service and Board Plan programs 
but, having made this comment, he would support the package as proposed 
by 
Governor Bucher and the System Committee on Employee Benefits. 
The package of changes recommended by Governor Bucher also 
contained changes that would facilitate inclusion of new Reserve Bank 
Personnel in the Retirement and Thrift Plans when such personnel might 
be employed in connection with the establishment of a regional check 
Processing center, as recently had been done by the Federal Reserve 
B
ank of New York. 
Another amendment included in the proposals submitted to the 
Board was a suggested supplement of 5 per cent to the allowances of 
e
ligible persons who had retired prior to January 1, 1973, as a means 
helping to maintain their pension purchasing power as well as to 
a s
s i s t in the transition from 1972 pension levels to those proposed for 
1973. 

3285 
11/20/72 
-12-
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Board approved the 
amendments as presented in Governor Bucher's memorandum. A copy of 
the letter sent to Mr. Heflin is attached as Item No. 15. A copy of 
a
 telegram sent to the Reserve Banks and to the Retirement Office is 
attached as Item No. 16. 
CBT Corporation. On November 2, 1972, the Board deferred action 
°n the application of CBT Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut, to acquire 
shares of the successor by merger to Fairfield County National Bank, 
Norwalk, Connecticut. 
In a memorandum dated November 16, 1972, the 
banking Markets Section provided additional information on the case. 
Ihe Banking Markets Section recommended approval of the application 
conditioned on the merger within two years of Fairfield County National 
Bank into the applicant's lead bank, The Connecticut Bank and Trust 
Company, Hartford, Connecticut. At today's meeting the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation also recommended approval. However, it 
w
as noted that the proposal included five annual payments of $34,000 
t o
 an officer of Fairfield County National Bank in return for his 
a
greement not to engage in banking business in the general area of the 
hank. The Division's recommendation of approval would be conditioned 
modification of the proposal to remove that prohibition. 
The Board approved the application subject to the two condi-
tions 
recommended by the staff, Governors Robertson and Brimmer 

32-88 
11/20/72 
-13-
dissenting. 
It was understood that an order reflecting that decision 
would be prepared for the Board's consideration and that a dissenting 
statement also would be prepared. 
Real and personal property leasing. On February 18, 1972, the 
Board published for comment a proposal that would permit bank holding 
companies to engage in real property leasing under certain specified 
conditions. 
In a memorandum dated October 26, 1972, the Legal Division, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation, and the Banking Markets 
Section recommended that the Board publish for comment a revised amend-
ment to Regulation Y, Bank Holding Companies, that would permit real 
and personal property leasing within one regulatory activity, subject 
to substantially the same conditions as those previously published. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft Federal Register notice reflecting 
this recommendation. 
In a memorandum dated October 27, 1972, the Banking Markets 
Section disagreed with one aspect of the proposed amendment—an assump-
tion that the salvage value for real property would be zero. It was 
r e
commended that the Board adopt a more realistic way of setting the 
Salvage value for real property. The salvage value for buildings would 
ec
lual the estimated salvage value at the end of the minimum useful life 
a
llowed by the Internal Revenue Service. 
For land, original cost would 
be used as a proxy for salvage value. 

3287 
11/20/72 
-14-
At today's meeting it was pointed out that the assumption of 
a salvage value of zero for real property had been made to discourage 
holding companies from speculating in land. 
It also was noted that 
after the proposal had been published for comment it could be liberalized 
to incorporate the Banking Markets recommendation without republication 
for comment. 
Several members of the Board agreed with the Banking Markets 
Section. Other members preferred to publish the proposal in the more 
restrictive form with the understanding that the Banking Markets recom-
mendation would be considered before adoption of the amendment. 
Continuing discussion failed to develop a consensus, and action 
the proposal was deferred. 
It was understood that a draft amendment 
reflecting the Banking Markets recommendation would be prepared for the 
Board's consideration. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Board Action on Discount 
Rate of November 20,

STRICTLY 
S T R I C T L Y 
C O N F I D E N T I A L 
! *AI 
A s you will recall from Mr. Tynan Smith's letter of 
October 27, the Board has instructed the sta,ff to communicate 
«vU the Presidents the reasons for its actions to disapprove 
Proposed changes in the discount rate. 
The Presidents were 
Citified at the time of the FOMC meeting that the Board had 
voted on November 20 to disapprove a pending increase to 
per cent proposed by one Reserve Bank. 
The Board's decision was influenced in part by the latest 
'-•Ucrrnation showing that so reads between the current discount rate 
^tud key money market rates had not widened in recent weeks and 
•indeed heid narrowed in some cases. 
Account was also taken by 
tlii> Board of the significant narrowing in the differentials that 
^-'•• c; developed between the discount rate and most long -term 
f o r e s t rates. 
In reaching its decision the Board took note 
-tiio somewhat higher level of member bank borrowings in recent 
Veor.s but dec id *d that the amount of such borrowings to date did 
-'Oem to impel an increase in the discount rate. 
'Ihe Board concluded that a rise in the discount rate at 
M V 
time mi trill we? I be viewed as leading rather than following 
market. 
The resulting impact on market rates and attitudes 
a period of seasonal credit demands might be substantial 
1T;- »ho Board's judgment and could tend to exacerbate pressure,-;

extend controls to interest rai.es. 
In light of these c i r c u m -
and also in view of the behavior of monetary aggregates 
lx decent weeks and cf the efforts of the Committee on Interest 
Dividends to moderate somewhat the rise in bank lending rates, 
V v, „ 
wc-. Board decided that a higher discount rate at the present time

ADDRESS Orr.niAL CORRCSPONDCNCC 
•to TMC BOARD 
November 21, 1972 
Recent correspondence from the United States Water Resources 
^Uricil ("Council") to the Board of Governors stated the requirement of 
e
-cl\ executive agency to develop procedures and regulations to carry out 
J-
,e
 provisions of Executive Order 11296, "Evaluation of Flood Hazard in 
. g a t i n g Federally Owned or Financial Buildings, Roads, and Other Facili-
X e s
> and in Disposing of Federal Lands and Properties." 
The Council has 
j^Veloped the attached "Flood Hazard Evaluation Guidelines for Federal 
^^cutive Agencies" intended to assist Federal agencies in developing 
Procedures and regulations implementing the Executive Order. 
q 
A1 tliough there exists some question as to whether Executive 
t f t r
 11296, in its definition of "executive agency," is intended to 
^conipi.es ti 1 G p v C S e r v e Banks, the Board believes that it is in the best. 
!
^'rost of the System to develop procedures designed to carry out the 
Jfcctives of. the Executive Order. Accordingly, the Board intends to 
l>n°
ri11
 
Council that it has taken steps aimed at developing System-
R
 
f 0
 Procedures and/or regulations relating to flood hazard problems 
^•lono 
the System's facilities including the Federal Reserve Banks. 
^ 
a ratter of policy, therefore, the Banks and their branches should

Sear M r . Maughan: 
The Board has considered your letter of June 19, 1972 
delating to "Flood. Hazard Evaluation Guidelines for Federal 
Executive Agencies," which have been implemented by Executive 
Order 11296, daued April 10, 1966. 
It is the Board's view that while the Federal Reserve 
Banks and their branches are not "departments, agencies, 
establishments, corporations or other organizational entities 
the Executive Branch/' the. term utilized by the Executive 
0rd.?,r? they are Federal instrumentalities and as such should 
comply with the spirit of that Order. 
Regarding the development of procedures and regula-
tions, the Board hay requested its Division of Federal Reserve 
Bank Operations to coordinate the System's program and to 
maintain contact with the United States Water Resources Council 
the purpose of assuring that the Reserve Banks receive 
teclrni c a 1 advice.

Dear H r , Barret: 
This is in response to your letter of June 27, 1972 
* y a r d i n g your request for permission to deduct amounts due from 
other banks in calculating your reserve requirements under the 
C
Ucurustances set forth in your letter. 
As you may know, § 19(g) of the Federal Reserve Act 
U.S.C. § 465) specifically authorizes a member bank to deduct 
fl
'or,; .its demand deposits the amounts of balances due from other 
^-mks. 
There is no similar authorization contained in the 
H-deral Reserve Act in the case of time deposits. 
There is 
£
lso I)CJ provision in the Board's Regulation D (12 CFR 204) at the 
Present time which would authorize such a deduction. 
The Board believes that amendment of its Regulation 0 
as to authorize a deduction such as you request, is not 
g r a n t e d . 
If you feel that the arrangement set forth in your 
better imposes an undue reserve burden upon you, the solution 
Wo
'-Ud appear to be to renegotiate the agreements under which the 
Va
*-"ious inunicipaiit:ier> deposit funds with you. 
Very truly yours,

Board.believes that its 
course of action is in the public 
interest. 
As you know, the banking community was notified some 
eight months ago that, the changes in Regulation J were being 
considered. 
Over four months ago these amendments were adopted. 
This action followed extensive communication with and receipt of 
alternative proposals from the banking community. 
The amendments 
finally adopted reflected changes urged by these banks. 
Further, 
in an effort to ameliorate any possible significant adverse 
impact on noninem.ber banks, the Board announced provisions adopted 
for granting credit to such nonmember banks on the same terms 
credit would be given member banks. The record in this matter 
does not confirm your assertion of rejection by the Board of many 
efforts on the part of the litigant banks for compromise. 
It 
does reflect a well considered, studied decision by the Board

that alternative courses of action proposed by segments of the 
banking community failed to achieve the degree of uniform appli-
cation, and immediacy of effect determined by the Board to be 
required with respect to the Regulation J amendments. 
The con-
sistency of the Board's adopted action vi.th the interest of the 
public and the equitable nature of that action is confirmed in an 
Opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
in denying an emergency appeal from the refusal by the District 
Court to enjoin Regulation J implementation. 
The Board's action 
also finds support in a Memorandum on Behalf of Amici Curiae 
(including large ana small banks, country and reserve city banks, 
both members and nonmembers of the System). filed in the District 
Court for the District of Columbia, to the effect that the amend-

UNITED CAROLINA BANCSHARES CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of First Credit Corporation 
United Carolina Bancshares Corporation, Whiteville, North 
C a r
o l i n a , a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding 
C
°ropany Act, has applied for the Board's approval, under § 4(c)(8) of the

First Credit Is a consumer finance company licensed under State 
*
a w
 to make consumer loans with cash advances not exceeding $900. 
First 
C r e
dit also acts as agent with respect to the sale of credit life, accident 
health insurance in connection with its own extensions of credit. 
First Credit of Shallotte was organized in January of 1970 as the 
C o n f
idential Loan Corporation ("Confidential"). 
Applicant, through its 
l 6 a d 
b a
n k , The Waccamaw Bank and Trust Company, Whiteville, North Carolina 
^ Bank") y w a s instrumental in the formation of Confidential and loaned funds 
°
r i t s
 original working capital. 
Subsequently, Confidential defaulted on 
t s
 loans from Bank. On March 20, 1971, Bank exercised its rights under the 
°
atl
 agreement and took possession of all of the capital stock of Confidential 
satisfaction of the debt previously contracted. 
This resulted in Appli-
a t l t s
 indirect acquisition of Confidential. 
Thereafter, Confidential was 
l^Aiu 
Sanized and its name changed to First Credit Corporation. On April A , 
Applicant indirectly acquired through First Credit certain assets of 
Atlantic Loan Company, Wilmington, North Carolina ("Atlantic"). 
Using 
the 
a c
counts acquired from Atlantic as a base, Applicant now operates an 
C e
 of First Credit in Wilmington. 
The Board has previously stated that when a bank holding company 
e
ctly acquires a nonbanking company through a subsidiary bank and 
S e c
luently applies to retain the nonbanking company under authority 
the Board must consider the transaction as if the nonbanking 
^Ojjj 
a n
y was being acquired initially from an independent third party 
(1972 i? 
Hgderal Reserve Bulletin 936). Accordingly, in such circumstances, 

3 3 0 2 
-3-
Board is required to find that neither the original acquisition, nor 
M e n t i o n thereof, of the nonbanking company would result in an undue con-
j u r a t i o n of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of 
i n
terests, or unsound banking practices. Applicant's retention of First 
Credit of Shallotte, together with First Credit of Wilmington, is therefore 
c
°nsidered on this basis. 
The relevant georgraphic market for the consumer loan activities 
e n
8aged in by both offices of First Credit appears to be the Wilmington 
which includes the counties of Brunswick and New Hanover. On the 
b a s
i s of aggregate consumer loans outstanding of about $502 thousand, First 
C r e d
i t is the 8th largest of 19 consumer loan companies in that market con-
acting a similar business, controlling about 5 per cent of consumer loans 
S t a n d i n g . 
Applicant, through Bank, operates eight banking offices in 
B r
unswick County. 
First Credit is the sole consumer loan company in 
S h a
U o t t e . 
Due to differing rates of interest and lengths of time that 
C r e c J
it is extended by Bank and First Credit of Shallotte, it does not appear 
t h a t
 the respective institutions presently compete with one another to any 
S 1
^ i f i c a n t degree. Further, it does not appear that significant potential 
^ P e t i t i o n for consumer loans would develop between Bank and First Credit. 
A c
cordingi y > no significant existing or potential competition would be 
e l i
minated through the retention by Applicant of First Credit's Shallotte 

3303 
-4-
First Credit of Wilmington, with consumer loans outstanding of 
a
Pproximately $94,000, is the 18th largest of 19 offices located in 
u
®iiigton 
North Carolina. 
Bank operates two offices in Wilmington, where 
e n
gages, to a limited degree, in making consumer loans. For the same 
t e a S o n s
 as discussed in connection with First Credit's Shallotte office, it 
°
Gs
 not appear that Bank and First Credit of Wilmington are engaged in 
^ i f leant c o m p e t i t i o n f o r consumer loans, nor does it seem that the respective 
n s
titutions would likely compete for consumer loans in the future. 
Accord-
it is the Board's judgment that no significant existing or potential 
^Petition would be eliminated upon approval of Applicant's retention of 
s t
 Credit's Wilmington office. 
First Credit's two offices also sell credit life insurance and 
a e r
*t and health insurance in connection with loans it originates. 
Due 
to H 
l e
 limited nature of its insurance activities it does not appear that 
Appi. 
W a n t ' s retention of First Credit's insurance activities would have any 
8 t l i
ficant effect on either existing or potential competition. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant and its 
U b s i
d i a r y banks are considered satisfactory in view of Applicant's corcmit-
^ n t t-
Provide additional capital for its two largest subsidiary banks, and 
0
jscted growth and earnings for the group appear favorable. The financial 
l t l
o n of First Credit is, at present, inadequate. 
If the application to 
r e
 First Credit is approved, Applicant proposes to supply additional 
t o
 First Credit as its operations require. 
First Credit's management 
ta e s 
S e t
*tialiy the same as Bank's, and is considered experienced and capable. 

3304 
-5-
relating to the financial and managerial resources of 
applicant, its subsidiary banks and First Credit are, therefore, consistent 
w i f c
h approval of the application. 
First Credit's Shallotte office is the only consumer finance company 
i n
 Brunswick County and, therefore, adds materially to the convenience and 
n e e d s
 of that area. Although the Wilmington office of First Credit is one of 
19 c
°nsumer loan companies serving that city, it serves as an additional com-
p e t
i t i v e alternative for such services. Accordingly, convenience and needs 
fa 
c
tors are consistent with, and lend some weight toward approval of the 
a
Pplication. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations reflected in 
th e
 record, the Board has determined that the balance of the public interest 
fa 
ct
°rs the Board is required to consider under § 4(c)(8) is favorable. 
A c c
o r d i n g i y j the application is hereby approved. 
This determination is 
S u b
Ject to the conditions set forth in § 225.4(c) of Regulation Y and 
Board's authority to require such modification or termination of 
e 
a c
tivities of a holding company of any of its subsidiaries as the 
r d
 finds necessary to assure compliance with the provisions and purposes 
of t,

 successor organization is treated herein as the proposed acquisi-
t i o n
 of the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for in-
v e s t e d persons to submit comments and views, has been given in 
a C c
ordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and 
s h
a s expired, and the Board has considered the application and 
all 
c
°mments received in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
°
f
 the Act (12 u.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant, the second largest banking organization in New 
y 
terms of domestic deposits, controls four subsidiary banks 
V , l t h
 aggregate deposits of approximately $13.6 billion, representing 

3308 
-2-
i^.l per cent of the total deposits in commercial banks in the State. 
(Unless otherwise noted, deposit data are as of December 31, 1971, 
a n
d market data are as of June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect bank hold-
ing 
company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board through 
October 31, 1972.) 
Consummation of the proposal would not significantly 
U r e a s e Applicant's share of deposits in the State. 
Bank ($12,9 million in deposits) is the seventeenth largest 
o f 2
9 banks in the Mid-Hudson banking market, which includes all of 
^tchess, Putnam and Ulster Counties, and the Newburgh area of Orange 
County, controlling 1.7 per cent of the deposits in that market. 
The 
barest office of one of Applicant's banking subsidiaries is approxi-
mately 60 miles south of Bank's Barclay Heights branch and there is 
n
° significant existing competition between this or any other of 
applicant's subsidiaries. While Applicant is a likely potential 
e n t
rant to the market, it is unlikely that, absent this proposal, 
APPlleant would enter de novo. 
Its subsidiaries are prohibited until 
Ja
*ui«ry 1, 1976, from branching into the market and, due to the low 
t a t
i o of population to banking offices in the market, establishment 
a
 de novo subsidiary appears unlikely. Additionally, consumma-
t l o t
* of the proposal would not be likely to raise barriers to entry 
since 
Bank is not a significant factor in the market and there are 
independent banks remaining for acquisition. 
Consummation of 
Proposal will not have any significant adverse effects on existing 
Potential competition.

However, Applicant proposes to 
Provide through Bank an alternative source of specialized banking

Considerations relating to convenience and needs of the 
communities to be served are consistent with approval. 
It is the 
Sard's judgment that the proposed acquisition would be in the public

Applicant owns two nonbanking subsidiaries, Berkeley

In making its determination herein, the Board has relied

have

The. Board of Governors of the. Federal Reserve System today 
revision of its rules for lending to member banks designed, 
' A i r i l y , to assist smaller banks in meeting the seasonal borrowing 
ot their communities. 
The proposal is e further step in a program by the Board t;o

•U '•"-inent recommendations for revision of the Board';? Regulation A , 
•
0 v
*vnln R lending by Federal Reserve Banks. The recommendations were 
a system c.aok force following a three-year study of Federal 
V e
 lendjng practices and policies. 
Certain recommend a triors 
tog from the study have previously been adopted as part of the 
- n s procedures. 
As suggested by the study, the changes now pro-
POgp,] 
uould modernize ar.d simplify the Regulation. 
The proposed 
wore published for comment: through February 28. 
Xn connection with the proposed revision of Regulation A , 
^ 
^oard said: 
The rules for Federal Reserve lending arply to all banks 
that are. members of the. Federal Reserve System. 
Member banks 
nearly 30 per cent of all commcrcial bank deposits. 
Tn proposing revision of Regulation />, however, the Board 
. 
Perrticuiarly interested in encouraging increased use of the 
••^sources of member banks serving communities with, seasonal 
ixeov for funds, such ^s communities affected by trades or 
•'-v»'.it;<-t 
Kith pronruteed seasonal or> .irnting patterns, and 
cvj! tut'ai arid resort cress. 

~ 2-
Close to half of all member banks--more than 2,400 of 
the System's approximately 5,700 commercial banks--are esti-
mated, on the basis of historical lending and deposit patterns, 
to have substantial seasonal calls for credit in their com-
munities . Of these, ever 2,000, or more than 90 per cent of 
the seasonally impacted banks, are banks with no more than 
$50 million total deposits. 
The seasonal borrowing privilege now proposed is meant 
to enhance the ability of member banks to serve the credit 
needs of their communities and areas. 
In addition, the proposal makes a number of technical 
changes broadening the types of paper that can be 
a c c e p t e d 
as collateral, for Federal Reserve advances. 
No change in the stance of monetary policy, in either 
the short or the long run, is intended or expected to result 
from the proposed revision of Regulation A . 
The proposed revision is an outgrowth of recommendations made 
in a System report entitled ''•Reappraisal of the Federal Reserve Discount 
Mechanism" and published in July of 19 68 by a System task force headed 
by Federal Reserve Board Governor George W , Mitchell. 
In the inter-
vening time, the Federal Reserve has incorporated into its procedures 
the substance of the recommendations of the task force relating to 
fcrcergency credit -co member and nonmcriiber deposit type institutions. 
The proposal 
a n n o u n c e d today would establish a new seasonal borrowing 
r>ti.viipGe in line with task force recommendations. 
The major remaining 
r
ccomm2ndation, for a short-term "basic" borrowing privilege, Is receiving 
further study.

Sections 2.17 and 5.1(a) of the Plan would be amended to provide 
that the pension payable on retirement at 65 would be computed 
under a "step rate" technique rather than the "offset" now used. 
The new pension would amount to 1.3 percent: of the retiree's 
final average salary (highest consecutive 5-vear average) not in 
excess of the Social Security integration level ($5,856 in 1973) 
plus 1.8 percent o£ final average salary in excess of the inte-
gration level, multiplied by years of creditable service.

Section 6 would be amended to eliminate all actuarial-type 
reductions in pensions for members who retire after reaching age 
60 and have at least 30 years of. creditable service; for those 
under AG tmose combined 
and years of service total at least 
9 0 , actuarial-type reduction.; w i l l also be eliminated for years

e^rly retirement reduction) 80 percent of such member's final 
average salary. 
Approved 
Survivorship option at retirement. 
Section 9.4(a) would be amended to permit a retiring member whose 
a
8e is CO or more, or whose aye plus years of: creditable service 
equal 90 or more, to convert his single-life pension at one-half 
the regular actuarial cost to provide that his surviving spouse, 
Parent, brother or sister, or son or daughter, would continue to 
deceive a payment of not more than 50 percent of his converted 
pension, provided, that if a retiree desires to continue a pay--
^•ent of more than 50 percent of his converted pension to his 
designated survivor the full actuarial rate of conversion would 
be applied on tha excess. 
Approved
