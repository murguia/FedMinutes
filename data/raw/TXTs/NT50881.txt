of the question of selection of a successor to Eliot Swan, who had decided 
to retire in mid-1972 from the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of

desirable in a suitable successor to Mr. Swan as President. 
Chairman Burns then called for consideration of the letter of 
February 3, 1972, from Chairman Wilson of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco, which inquired whether the Board would be willing to accept 
any one of several listed individuals if they were to be nominated by the 
Board of Directors of the San Francisco Bank as successor to President 
Swan. After discussion, the Board agreed on those individuals on that 
list whom it would indicate to the San Francisco Bank that the Board was 
Prepared to approve without question at this time, if the San Francisco 
Board of Directors should so nominate them. This decision was conveyed 
to Chairman Wilson by letter from Chairman Burns. 
(Note: Copies of that 
letter, the incoming letter from Chairman Wilson of the San Francisco Bank,
