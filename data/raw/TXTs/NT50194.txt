 involved in the proposed merger of The Bradford National Bank, 
c

A small amount of competition exists between The 
Bradford National Bank and The Miami Citizens National 
Bank & Trust Company, Piqua, and the overall effect 
of the proposal on competition would be slightly adverse. 
Regulation F matter. 
Seattle Trust and Savings Bank, Seattle, 
Washington, had requested that the Board grant the privilege of confi-
d e
ntial treatment with respect to certain information required by 
R e
gulation F, Securities of Member State Banks, ordinarily to be 
deluded in proxy-soliciting material furnished to shareholders in 
connection with a bank's annual meeting. 
Specifically, the Seattle 
member bank wished to omit from its proxy statement "the specific 
salaries of the members of the bank's management" and "the share 
holdings of the directors." 
' 
, 
; 
In recognition that disclosure of certain information may be 
i n
jurious, section 206.3(c) of Regulation F permits the Board to grant 
c
°nfidential treatment to avoid the infliction of hardship in particular 
QG 
e
s where disclosure would be more likely to result in harm to the bank 
n c
erned than in benefits to the public. However, in a memorandum of 
D e
cember 15, 1967, the Legal Division recommended that the request of 
Seattle bank be denied as to both classes of information involved. 
The Legal Division's memorandum was accompanied by a letter pro-
pO s QH I-
to be sent to the member bank and an order proposed to be issued. 
While there was no disagreement with the Division's recommenda-
ti 
°
n
 that the member bank's request be denied, question was raised with 

* 4880 
12/19/67 
-3-
regard to the need for handling the matter in so formal a manner as pro-
posed by the Division. After some discussion of that point, it was 
understood that the staff would advise the member bank of the Board's 
position on the matter and state that an order would be issued if the 
bank so desired, but not otherwise. 
A copy of the letter sent as a result of the Board's action is 
attached as Item No. 1. 
Reserve status of certain banks. 
Southern California First 
National Bank, San Diego, California, had requested reconsideration by 
^ e Board of its decision earlier this year that the bank must maintain 
the reserves required of reserve city banks beginning April 11, 1968, 
atl
d United States National Bank, also of San Diego, had asked that the 
Board reconsider its decision, likewise reached earlier this year, that 
must maintain the reserves required of reserve city banks beginning 
January 4, 1968. City National Bank, Beverly Hills, California, had 
r e
quested an additional postponement of one year from January 4, 1968, 
the date on which it must begin to maintain the reserves required 
t o
 be maintained by reserve city banks. 
of 
A meeting at the Board's offices, attended by Governors Mitchell 
a n c l
 Brimmer and members of the Board's staff, had been held on December 15, 
to allow representatives of the three banks to present their requests 
a l l
y - 
Copies of a transcript of the proceeding had been made available 

> 4881 
12/19/67 
-4-
to the Board members, and copies of staff memoranda discussing the three 
cases had been provided earlier. 
Governors Mitchell and Brimmer indicated that they could find no 
valid reason for granting the request of City National Bank, which had 
opened a downtown office in the heart of the commercial and financial 
district of the city of Los Angeles in January of this year and had been 
attempting to operate in the manner of a reserve city bank, albeit not 
too successfully thus far from a cost standpoint. The bank also had 
several other offices in Los Angeles. 
As to Southern California First National Bank, Governors Mitchell 
a n d
 Brimmer noted that through purchase of a smaller national bank earlier 
this year the San Diego bank had acquired two offices in the city of 
Los Angeles. At the time the Board learned of the proposed merger, it 
h
ad endeavored to alert the San Diego bank that acquisition of the two 
o f
fices in Los Angeles would subject the bank to higher reserve require-
m e n t s
- 
However, such advice, transmitted through the Federal Reserve 
B a
n k of San Francisco, had been given to the member bank orally, and it 
appeared possible that there had been some misunderstanding on the part 
o f
 the bank as to the exact import of the information that the Board had 
S o u
g h t to provide to it. In the circumstances, Governors Mitchell and 
Br i 
^ e r felt that there would be justification in giving the member bank 
Period of 18 months within which it must decide whether to close or 

• 
4 8 8 2 
12/19/67 
-5-
otherwise dispose of the two offices in the city of Los Angeles, with 
the clear understanding that if the bank did not take such action it 
would then become subject to reserve city bank reserve requirements. 
As to United States National Bank, it appeared that the bank 
had found its location in the city of Los Angeles to be unsatisfactory 
for the purpose of attempting to operate in the manner of a reserve city 
b
ank and that it had just recently acquired a new location. 
Governors 
Mitchell and Brimmer concluded that the Board would be justified, in the 
circumstances, in granting the bank permission to carry reduced reserves 
an additional period of 18 months in order to afford the bank an 
°PP0rtunity to begin to operate effectively at its new location. 
They 
n
°ted that representatives of the bank were on record to the effect that 
n
° furth 
er extension of the country bank reserve privilege would be sought. 
There was general agreement with the views expressed by Governors 
Mitchell and Brimmer, and accordingly the actions reflected in their 
r e c
ommendations were approved unanimously. 
Copies of the letters sent to the three member banks are attached 
a s
 Items 2 through 4. inclusive. 
Director appointment. M r . Fauver referred to the Board's recent 
d e c
i s i o n to appoint Mr. Norman B. Houston, Senior Vice President and 
Tre 
Usurer of Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, Los Angeles, 
a
lifornia, as a director of the Los Angeles Branch of the Federal 

* 4883 
12/19/67 
-6-
Reserve Bank of San Francisco for the three-year term ending December 31, 
1970. He said that according to advice received from the Reserve Bank, 
Mr. Houston would be pleased to accept the appointment and would be 
willing to resign as a director and officer of a savings and loan 
association with which he was affiliated. 
If desired, he would resign 
as such before the end of this year, but he would prefer to do so in a 
more orderly way at the annual meeting of the association to be held in 
the latter part of January. Also, although M r . Houston did not hold any 
Political or public office in the usual sense, he was a member of the 
Los Angeles Human Relations Commission and wanted to be sure that the 
Board did not consider continuation of service in that capacity to be 
inappropriate. 
No objection was indicated to continuation by M r . Houston of his 
service as a member of the Human Relations Commission while serving as 
a
 director of the Los Angeles Branch. As to his service as a director 
and officer of the savings and loan association, it was suggested that 
t 
e b
e advised that the effective date of his appointment as a director 
o f
 the Los Angeles Branch would be deferred until after his resignation 
f^om those positions had been accomplished, which it was understood might 
b e
 around the end of January, and there was agreement with that suggestion. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Sherman and Kenyon then 
w
ithdrew from the meeting.

Salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presidents. 
Governor 
Mitchell noted that the Chairmen of all of the Federal Reserve Banks 
except Atlanta had been informed of the action taken by the Board earlier 
this month in amending its guidelines relating to the eligibility of 
Presidents and First Vice Presidents for salary increases and of the 
annual salary rates that the Board would be willing to approve under 
the amended guidelines if such rates were fixed by the Boards of Directors 
°f the respective Banks. 
The Secretary added that replies had now been received from all 
the Reserve Banks except Boston and Philadelphia that would have been 
expected to respond, and Governor Mitchell said that only in one case 
(Cleveland) had question been raised with regard to the salary rate that 
the Board had indicated it would be willing to approve. The Chairman 
°f the Cleveland Bank had requested that an exception be made to the 
guidelines to permit the salary of the President of that Bank to be 
increased to $50,000. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that the 
taking of an exception to the guidelines would not be appropriate, and 
n
° opinion to the contrary was expressed by other members of the Board. 
w
a s understood that the Chairman of the Cleveland Bank would be 
a
dvised accordingly. A copy of the letter sent to Chairman Hall is 
a t
tached as Item No. 5 .

As to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Governor Mitchell 
s
aid that the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building

Plans had arranged to meet with First Vice President Kimbrel for a dis-
cussion bearing on management succession and related matters and that 
the Committee would then report back to the Board. 
Chairman and Deputy Chairman at Boston. 
In light of a report 
b
y Chairman Martin that Mr. Howard W . Johnson would be agreeable to 
serving as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1968 and 
that Mr. Charles W. Cole would be agreeable to continuing to serve as 
Deputy Chairman through the end of that year, the Board designated 
Johnson as Chairman and Federal Reserve Agent for 1968, subject to 
the usual terms and conditions, and appointed M r . Cole as Deputy Chairman 
f
°r 1968. 
Balance of payments. 
Governor Brimmer referred to a memorandum, 
C o
Pies of which had been made available to the members of the Board 
Yesterday under a "strictly confidential" label, in which the Federal 
Rp 
serve Bank of New York suggested measures that might be taken to 
b
°lster confidence in the U.S. dollar and to bring about a large reduc-
t i o
n in the balance of payments deficit in 1968. He inquired as to the 
s t a
t u s of the document, and Chairman Martin replied that the memorandum 
had been prepared at his invitation. 
The paper was not intended to be a 
f
W i s h e d product, and the Reserve Bank had not sent it to the Treasury, 
u t
 he (Chairman Martin) had handed a copy to the Treasury yesterday in 
t l l e
 thought that some of the ideas in it might be helpful.

t i V

members under yesterday's date a memorandum proposing (1) that the Board 
request U.S. banks with foreign branches to extend a larger share of 
their loans to foreign borrowers through such branches, and (2) that the 
\ 
.. 
Board ask the banks to shift to their foreign branches a substantial 
share of the loans to foreigners currently outstanding on the books of 
the head offices. 
After a brief discussion, it was understood that the subject 
Would be considered further at the Board meeting tomorrow. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Mr. J . c . Baillargeon, Jr., President, 
Seattle Trust & Savings Bank, 
804 Second Avenue, 
Seattle, Washington.

Dear M r . Baillargeon: 
Reference is made to your bank
!
s request of November 27, 
1967, for confidential treatment of information relating to remun-
e r
ation and share holding of its directors and officers required to 
ke included in proxy soliciting material to be furnished shareholders 
connection with your bank
f
s annual meeting, pursuant to section 206.5 
Federal Reserve Regulation F . 
It was the intent of the 1964 amendments to the Securities 
^ c h a n g e Act of 1934 to require corporations whose securities are 
traded in the over-the-counter market, including banks, to make public 
m
°
r
e information about their affairs than had been customary in the 
P a s
t . 
In adopting Item 6 and 7 of Form F-5, the Board of Governors 
a c t
e d upon the belief that public disclosure in a bank's proxy state-
m e n t
 of management's remuneration and share holdings helps investors 
t o
 evaluate the management of a bank, and permits the intelligent 
G X e
r c i s e of the shareholders' vote. 
Similar requirements have been 
l m
Posed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and by the Securities 
a
nd Exchange Commission. 
^ 
The bank does not advance persuasive reasons as to undue 
a
rdship, loss, or damage that would justify exempting it from require-
ments that are applicable to, and have been complied with by all other 
a n
k s similarly situated. 
In this regard, it should be noted that two 
°ther banks in the State of Washington are both subject to similar dis-
osure requirements under the regulations promulgated by the FDIC. 
It should also be noted that all officers, directors, and 
^
r i
-ncip ai shareholders of "Regulation F banks" are required to file 
e t
ail e ci ownership reports (Forms F-7 and F-8) pursuant to section 16(a) 

4 S f e y 
Mr. J . c. Baillargeon, Jr. 
-2-
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As these reports are a matter 
°f public record, and the Board's new release, "Summary of Equity 
Security Transactions and Ownership of Directors, Officers, and 
Principal Stockholders of Member State Banks", which summarizes the-
roore important changes in ownership in reports filed with the Board, 
l s
 available for public distribution, the Board does not believe that 
exclusion of this information from proxy soliciting material would 
Prevent any "competitive banker" from availing himself of this infor-
m
ation, if he so desired. 
Accordingly, the Board has concluded that the granting of 
t h
e confidential treatment requested would not be consistent with its 
statutory responsibilities. 
Very truly yours, 
{Signed) Horritl Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.

Dear Mr. Blakemore:

K 
This is in reply to your letter dated November 15, 
1967, in which you requested a review by the Board of the 
decision stated in its letter of October 4, 1967, that Southern 
California First National Bank was to maintain reserves at the 
level required of reserve city banks beginning April 11, 1968. 
Upon consideration of the information set forth in 
your letter, as supplemented by the information developed at the 
conference that you and Mr. Johnson attended in the Board's 
offi ces on Friday, December 15, the Board has granted your bank 
permission to continue to carry the reserves required of banks 
located outside of reserve cities until the beginning of the 
first reserve computation period after July 1, 1969. If on such 
date your bank continues to operate branches within the City of 
Los Angeles, it will be expected to maintain reserves thereafter 
a t
 the level required of reserve city banks. 
Very truly yours, 
Merritt Sherm 
Secretary.

i, 
This is in reply to your letter addressed to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco under date of October 6, 1967, in 
which 
you requested reconsideration of the decision stated in the 
Board's letter of June 26, 1967, that United States National Bank 
m
ust maintain reserves beginning January 4, 1968, at the level

The Board has reviewed the matter in light of the 
^formation presented in your letter, as supplemented by the 
information presented at the conference held at the Board's offices 
°
n
 Friday, December 15, attended by you and other representatives 
your bank. The Board understands from your statement at the 
conference that if a deferment of 18 months should be granted, 
your bank 
would make no further request for postponement of the 
e f
fective date. 
In all the circumstances, the Board has granted an exten-
s
i°n of the period within which your bank will be permitted to carry 
t
he reserves applicable to banks outside reserve cities until the 
^ginning of the first reserve computation period after July 1, 1969. 
•^is is on the understanding, as stated by you during the conference 
i n
 the Board's offices, that no further postponement of the effective 
date will be requested.

December 19, 1967. 
Mr. Joseph B. Hall, Chairman, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio 
44101. 
Dear Joe: 
This morning, I took up with the Board your letter 
of December 15, 1967, regarding Brad Hickman's salary. 
The 
Board feels that the proposals that it made for increases in 
the salaries of a number of Reserve Bank Presidents, one of 
which was for the President of your Bank as conveyed in my 
letter of the 8th, represented reasonable and appropriate 
recognition of the Presidents concerned at this time. 
The 
suggestion of a salary of $48,500 for Brad is consistent with 
what was done for several other Presidents, and we are glad 
to have your comments to the effect that the Cleveland Board 
concurs, even though it might have preferred a different 
treatment. 
We have appreciated your many services to the Federal 
Reserve and shall look forward to seeing you from time to time 
as one of our alumni.

Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,

°ear Mr. Hoyle: 
In accordance with the request contained in your 
better of December 14, 1967, the Director of the Division of 
Examinations, on behalf of the Board of Governors under 
delegated authority, approves the designation of Frank D. 
Souder, Jr., as a special assistant examiner for the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston. 
It is noted that Mr. Souder is a cooperative student 
a t
 Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, and that 
u
nder this plan the student works for periods of from three to 
s
ix months and then resumes his studies for like periods. 
Accordingly, approval of the designation of Mr. Souder as a 
s
