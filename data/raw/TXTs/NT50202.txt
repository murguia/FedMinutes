Private pension funds. There had been distributed a memorandum 
dated January 10, 1968, from Mr. Partee, who had attended in place of 
Chairman Martin a recent meeting of the President's Committee on Pen-
sion Funds at which certain legislative proposals developed by a task 
force were received. Basically these proposals contemplated (1) a 

1/11/68 
-2-
minimum standard of vesting of retirement benefits after 10 years' 
service after age 25, (2) a minimum standard of funding of the amounts 
vested in order to assure accumulation of assets in line with liabili-
ties, and (3) a system of mutual insurance to assure payment of the 
unfunded portion of vested benefits in cases of plan termination 
caused by financial difficulties. 
Attached to Mr. Partee's memorandum was a draft of memorandum 
that Secretary of Labor Wirtz, as Chairman of the President's Commit-
tee, proposed to send to the White House requesting sponsorship by the 
Administration of the legislative proposals. The draft memorandum 
included a statement that all of the agencies concerned, including the 
Federal Reserve, joined in recommending that the proposals receive 
high priority in the Administration's 1968 legislative program. Com-
ments on the draft memorandum had been requested by Secretary Wirtz. 
Mr. Partee reviewed language changes in the draft memorandum 
that he had proposed, the degree to which he had been successful in 
negotiating them, and certain others that he would suggest. He was 
concerned, among other things, that the memorandum refer to endorse-
ment of the proposals only in principle, since the specifics of the 
proposed legislation had not been fully agreed upon and legislative 
draft language had not yet been prepared. 
Discussion indicated that the members of the Board were gener-
ally sympathetic to legislation along the lines contemplated to 

f?3 
1/11/68 
-3-
establish minimum requirements for private pension funds. The view 
was expressed that the proposals seemed modest. However, it was recog-
nized that they were likely to encounter considerable resistance from 
industry and that an attempt at this stage to obtain stronger legisla-
tion probably would be unsuccessful. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was agreed that the 
changes Mr. Partee had suggested with respect to the draft memorandum 
were appropriate and that they should be made known to the Secretary 
of Labor. No other objection was indicated to the transmittal of the 
proposed memorandum to the White House. It was noted that the Board 
presumably would have an opportunity to comment on draft legislation 
when it became available. 
Film of chart show. Pursuant to the understanding at the 
Board meeting on May 15, 1967, the chart show on postwar monetary 
policy presented by the staff at a monetary symposium sponsored by the 
American Bankers Association in April 1967 had been converted into a 
film. The film was shown yesterday to the members of the Board in 
order to afford them an opportunity to form opinions on whether the 
film was suitable for distribution. 
Comments at today's meeting by members of the Board and the 
staff took into account the fact that the film was experimental and 
that somewhat different techniques would be envisaged if a similar 
project was undertaken again. However, it was generally agreed that 

1/11/68 
-4-
the subject matter had been handled reasonably well and that the film 
might be helpful both in portraying major economic trends during the 
postwar period and in suggesting the extent to which economic and 
financial data were analyzed in the formulation of monetary policy. 
It was suggested that audiences might benefit if the showing 
of the film was preceded by introductory background comments, and Mr. 
Gramley said it was planned to make available, with the film, copies 
of the explanatory reprint from the May 1967 Federal Reserve Bulletin. 
It was also suggested that a Federal Reserve representative be present, 
whenever possible, to answer questions following the showing of the 
film. 
The consensus was that it would be appropriate to purchase 
prints of the film for distribution through the Federal Reserve Banks 
as well as the Board's offices. 
Mr. Gramley noted that the contract for production of the film 
had been in an amount only slightly in excess of $5,000, but that an 
additional charge of $175 had been incurred to correct minor technical 
errors. The Board approved the additional expenditure. 
Mr. Gramley then suggested that 13 prints of the film be 
ordered, one of which would be supplied to each Federal Reserve Bank. 
His understanding was that the cost of the prints would be reduced 
from about $280 each to about $250 each if such an order was placed. 
A suggestion was made by staff that Reserve Banks might be 
interested in having additional copies of the film and, if so, that 

1/11/68 
-5-
the prints probably would be available at a lower price. It was then 
noted that Mr. Molony would be attending in the near future a meeting 
of System personnel interested in education and public relations. It 
was suggested that Mr. Molony arrange to show the film at that time to 
determine the reaction of the Reserve Bank representatives. 
There was agreement with this suggestion, and it was understood 
that the question of the number of prints to be ordered would be con-
sidered again by the Board on the basis of the reactions obtained by 
Mr. Molony. 
All members of the staff except Mr. Holland then withdrew from 
the meeting. 
Dinner for Governor O'Brien. The Board authorized payment of 
the cost of a small dinner at the Federal Reserve Building on the 
evening of Thursday, February 15, 1968, in honor of Governor O'Brien 
of the Bank of England, it being understood that the guest list would 
include the wives of the invited officials. 
The meeting then adjourned.
