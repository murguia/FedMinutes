Other appropriate members of the staff also 
attended portions of the meeting. 
Policy record entry. With a memorandum of November 4, 1969, 
Mr. Broida submitted a draft of policy record entry covering the 
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on August 12, 1969. 
The entry had been approved by the Board on October 24, no further 
suggestions for changes had been received, and the entry was now being 
submitted for final review. 
The release of the entry to the press on Monday, November 10, 
w a s approved unanimously. 
Commerce Bancshares. A memorandum from the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation dated October 17, 1969, and other pertinent papers, 
including a proposed order and statement, had been distributed in 
connection with an application of Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, 
Missouri, to acquire shares of Columbia National Bank, Columbia, Missouri. 
The application was approved unanimously, and the issuance of 
the order and statement was authorized. Copies are attached under 
Item No. 1. 
Amendment to Regulation Z. In a memorandum dated November 5, 
1969, the staff discussed a proposed amendment to Regulation Z, Truth 
in Lending, designed to alleviate some of the difficulties encountered 

11/6/69 
-3-
in implementing the Truth in Lending Act in the field of agricultural 
credit. Among other points, the amendment would provide that where 
dates or amounts of payments or advances could not be determined at 
the time of a credit transaction because they were tied to the needs 
of the farmer as they arose during the year, the creditor could disclose 
the method of computing the amount of the finance charge rather than a 
total dollar figure. At the same time the creditor could omit disclosure 
of the annual percentage rate, but he would be required to disclose 
the number, amount, and due dates of the payments and the total amount 
to be repaid, to the extent known. Attached to the memorandum were 
drafts of the proposed amendment, an interpretation thereof, and a 
press release. 
General agreement with the basic approach of the draft documents 
was expressed. However, Governor Brimmer suggested that the presentation 
should be expanded so as to make clear the limited scope of the amendment 
due to its relaxing nature. 
Following further discussion during which there was agreement 
that the Senate and House Banking and Currency Committees should be 
advised of the action as well as the reasons therefor, the amendment to 
Regulation Z was approved unanimously, effective immediately. Copies 
of the amendment and interpretation, as transmitted to the Federal 
Register, are attached under Item No. 2, along with a copy of the 
press release.

Citizens Trust and Savings Bank. By order dated March 19, 1969, 
the Board denied the application of Citizens Trust and Savings Bank, 
South Haven, Michigan, to acquire the assets and assume the deposit 
liabilities of The West Michigan Savings Bank, Bangor, Michigan. 
(Governor Daane dissented from the majority view that the proposed 
transaction would have a significantly adverse effect since it would 
eliminate existing and potential competition and would enhance the 
dominant position of Citizens Bank in an area where banking resources 
were already rather highly concentrated.) Subsequently, Citizens Bank 
requested that its application be reconsidered on the basis of addi-
tional material, including an independent market survey, which it 
submitted. 
In a memorandum dated November 3, 1969, the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation recommended that the request for reconsideration 
be denied on the grounds that the additional material provided little 
in the way of information that had not previously been considered. 
Attached to the memorandum was a proposed letter that would reflect 
this view. 
Comments by members of the Board indicated majority support 
for the Division's recommendation. However, Governor Brimmer suggested 
revisions of the proposed letter to clarify the issues involved. 
At the instance of Governor Daane, there was some discussion of 
the substantive issues. It was noted that the Bank Examination Department 

11/6/69 
- 5 -
of the Chicago Reserve Bank, based on its analysis of the additional 
information submitted, felt that reconsideration of the case would be 
warranted. However, the Reserve Bank's Research Department concurred 
in the view of the Board's staff that the additional information supplied 
did not deal with the aspects of concentration and potential competition, 
but instead argued a point that was less at issue; namely, the effect 
on existing competition. Additional comments called attention to the 
applicant's apparent misunderstanding of the principal thrust of the 
Board's statement. However, a procedural question rather than the 
substantive issue was involved, and it was the majority view that facts 
to support a request for reconsideration had not been developed as 
required under the Board's Rules of Procedure. 
The request for reconsideration was then denied, Governor Daane 
dissenting. A copy of the letter sent to Citizens Trust and Savings 
Bank is attached as Item No. 3. 
Reply to Congressman Staggers. Unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to Chairman Staggers of the House Committee on Interstate 
and Foreign Commerce with respect to possible loopholes in margin and 
disclosure requirements as applied to foreign bank financing of corporate 
takeovers. A copy of the letter, as transmitted, is attached as Item No. 4. 
In agreeing to send the letter, the Board noted comments by 
its staff that a problem in the area of the applicability of margin 
requirements to purpose loans by foreign banks was recognized, that the 
staff had the matter under study, and that in due course the staff expected 

11/6/69 
- 6 -
to present the question to the Board for consideration, with recom-
mendations as to possible courses of action. 
Personnel interlocks between banks and dealers. In a 
memorandum dated October 13, 1969, Mr. Hexter discussed questions 
that had arisen relating to personnel interlocks between banks and 
dealers in certain municipal obligations, and proposed courses of 
action that might be taken. 
At today's meeting there was agreement with Chairman Martin's 
suggestion that consideration of the problem be deferred until such 
time as Governor Mitchell could be present. 
Chase International Investment Corporation. By letter 
dated February 26, 1969, the Board granted consent to the acquisition 
by Chase International Investment Corporation, New York, New York, 
either directly or through Arcturus Investment & Development Limited, 
Montreal, Canada, of stock of an offshore holding company to be 
formed for the purpose of holding the stock of Societe Antillaise de 
Prodiuts Chimiques, a company to be incorporated under the laws of 
Martinique for the purpose of constructing and operating a fertilizer 
Plant. Subsequently, French impediments to direct investment were 
removed, and the organizers were of the view that utilization of an 
intermediate holding company would entail certain adverse tax conse-
quences. Accordingly, Chase now requested permission to acquire the 
shares of Societe without establishing the holding company. However, 

3360 
11/6/69 
- 7 -
that would result in a majority of the voting shares of the new 
company being held by Chase. 
In a memorandum dated October 31, 1969, the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation concluded that the facts presented war-
ranted an exception to the general policy of not approving the 
acquisition by an Edge corporation of the controlling interest of a 
nonfinancial business abroad. A proposed letter to Chase was 
attached. 
In a companion memorandum dated November 3, 1969, the Legal 
Division considered the question whether the Board had authority to 
permit Edge corporations to have nonfinancial subsidiaries. The 
Division concluded that the legislative history of the Edge Act 
would support the view that the Board had considerable discretion under 
the statute to permit an Edge corporation to acquire control of other 
corporations engaged in activities in which the Edge corporation 
could not itself engage so long as such acquisition was, in the Board's 
judgment, consistent with the statutory purpose for which Edge corpor-
ations were organized, i.e., generally to engage in international or 
foreign banking or financial operations. 
However, in a 1964 letter to the Treasury Department, the 
Board had made a slightly different legal interpretation when it 
indicated that the acquisition by an Edge corporation of more than a 
50 per cent stock interest in a nonfinancial corporation would 

3361 
11/6/69 
- 8 -
normally reflect an operating or management activity not contemplated 
by law or regulation and would therefore not be appropriate "except 
in rather rare instances where the circumstances of some foreign 
banking or financial operation warranted such acquisition." 
The Division recommended, if the Board agreed with the Legal 
Division's conclusion, that the Treasury Department be apprised of 
the Board's present interpretation of the statute. The Division 
also suggested that consideration be given to publication of the 
Board's policy in this area. 
Following staff comments, Governor Robertson expressed the 
view that it would not be necessary to reverse the 1964 position. 
As he saw it, that position need not stand in the way of approval of 
the present application, which called for a straightforward financing 
operation. He suggested that the letter to Chase be expanded to 
emphasize that point. 
There was general agreement with the approach suggested by 
Governor Robertson. It was also agreed that it would be appropriate 
to furnish a copy of the letter to Chase to the Treasury for its 
information, but that no further steps were necessary at this time. 
Unanimous approval was then given to a letter to Chase 
International Investment Corporation in the form attached as Item 
No. 5. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Program. In a memorandum dated 
October 24, 1969, Mr. Holland recommended that the Board and the 

3 
11/6/69 
- 9 -
Federal Reserve Banks conform in their operations with the spirit 
of Executive Order No. 11478, which outlined a continuing Equal 
Employment Opportunity Program generally compatible with the 10-point 
program recently adopted by the Board and the Reserve Banks. Attached 
was a proposed letter to the Presidents of all Federal Reserve Banks 
reflecting the Board's support of the Executive Order and encouraging 
the Banks to move forward with their action plans. 
Unanimous approval was given to Mr. Holland's recommendation. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Reserve Bank Presidents is attached 
as Item No. 6. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Regulations. In a memorandum 
dated October 24, 1969, Mr. Holland discussed a proposed revision of 
the Board's Regulations on Equal Employment Opportunity that would be 
generally in line with the Civil Service Commission's regulations 
that became effective July 1, 1969, and were subsequently amended. 
Attached to the memorandum was a copy of the revised regulations. If 
adopted, it was proposed that copies be distributed to all Board 
employees and sent to the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents for their 
information. 
The principal modifications effected by the revised regula-
tions were as follows: 
1. Changing the designation of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Officer to Director of Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity.

2. Changing the designation of the Deputy Equal 
Employment Opportunity Officer to Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Officer. 
3. Designating Equal Employment Opportunity 
Counselors with prescribed duties. 
4. Revising the complaints and hearings procedures, 
including the use of an outside hearing examiner. 
After discussion, the revised regulations were approved 
unanimously; a copy is attached as Item No. 7. Robert C. Holland 
was designated as Director of Equal Employment Opportunity and 
Elizabeth L. Carmichael was designated as Equal Employment Opportunity 
Officer, and the designation of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Counselors was authorized. 
Bank holding company legislation. Mr. Cardon summarized 
amendments that he understood had been incorporated into the one-bank 
holding company bill (II.R. 6778) passed by the House on November 5, 
1969. He indicated that as soon as he had had an opportunity to 
familiarize himself more thoroughly with the details of the bill he 
would prepare a memorandum for the Board's information. 
v X 
Pittsburgh Branch. Governor Sherrill reported on the situa-
tion at the Pittsburgh Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
where the guards had voted to organize. The union had requested a 
Meeting, which was scheduled for today, and a representative from the 
Board's Legal Division who had a background in labor relations had 
been sent to observe procedures and, if desired, to counsel the Bank 
its negotiations.

Members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland and Morgan 
then withdrew from the meeting. 
Director appointment. Governor Daane reported that in 
accordance with the suggestion made during the Board's discussion of 
director appointments yesterday he had called President Heflin of 
the Richmond Reserve Bank to inquire into the efforts made to develop 
candidates for the Charlotte Branch Board of Directors. President 
Heflin had responded that the two names suggested by the Bank were 
the result of the most thorough search they had ever made for desirable 
choices. They had developed 12 possibilities all told, and of them 
the two men finally suggested stood out. Mr. E. Craig Wall, in 
Particular, was regarded as being one of the most outstanding men in 
the entire southeast. However, Mr. Heflin offered to send in the 
remaining 10 names on the list for the Board to consider them if it 
wished. 
After discussion, the Board concluded that in view of the 
mtensiveness of the search already made and Mr. Wall's qualifications, 
he should be appointed to serve on the Charlotte Board. At the same 
time, the Board suggested that Mr. Heflin be asked to send in the 
names of the other possible candidates in order to have them available 
in the files. 
Accordingly, it was agreed that steps should be taken through 
the Chairman of the Richmond Bank to ascertain whether Mr. E. Craig Wall, 
Sr.> Chairman of the Board, Canal Industries, Inc., Conway, South Carolina,

would accept appointment if tendered as a director of the Charlotte 
Branch for the three-year term beginning January 1, 1970, with the 
understanding that if it were found that he would accept, the appoint-
ment would be made. (Note: It having been ascertained that Mr. Wall 
would accept the appointment if tendered, an appointment telegram 
was sent to him on November 13, 1969, with the understanding that 
announcement of the appointment would be made at the end of the year.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY 
COMMERCE BANCSHARES, INC., KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, 
FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION OF VOTING SHARES OF 
COLUMBIA NATIONAL BANK, COLUMBIA, MISSOURI 
STATEMENT 
Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri ("Applicant"), 
a registered bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, 
pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1042(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of more 
than CO per cent of the voting shares of the Columbia National Bank, 
Columbia, Missouri ("Bank"). 
Viev7s and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, notice of receipt of the application 
was given to the Comptroller of the Currency and his views and recommenda-
tion were requested. The Comptroller recommended approval of the 
application. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy 
to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in 
any part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
acquisition, the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 

3369 
-2-
be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, 
Or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the 
Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction 
are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of 
the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served. In each case, the Board is required to take into considera-
tion the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the 
bank holding company and the banks concerned, and the convenience and 
needs of the communities to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - The ten largest 
banking organizations in Missouri, three of which are holding companies, 
currently control $4.6 billion—'' in total deposits, 41.8 per cent of all 
deposits in the State. Applicant is the largest bank holding company 
and the third largest banking organization in the State of Missouri, 
ranking behind two independent banks located in downtown St. Louis. 
The nine subsidiary banks of Applicant hold aggregate deposits of 
$303 million, or 7.4 per cent of the deposits held by all commercial 
banks in the State. Of this amount, about $610 million is accounted 
for by Applicant's largest subsidiary, Commerce Trust Company, Kansas 
City. Acquisition of Bank, with $14 million in deposits, would increase 
the deposits under Applicant's control to about 7.5 per cent of the 
State total. Applicant would then control ten banks with total deposits 
of $817 million. It would remain the third largest banking organization 
in Missouri. 
1/ All banking data are as of December 31, 1968, adjusted to reflect 
holding company applications approved by the Board to date. 

3370 
-3-
Bank is located in Columbia, Missouri, in the central portion 
of the State, approximately midway between Kansas City and St. Louis. 
Bank is the smallest of four banks in Columbia, and the only one of the 
four not located in the downtown area. The three other banks in Columbia, 
which constitute Bank's principal competitors, range in deposit size from 
$1C million to $42 million. Consummation of Applicant's proposal would 
have no significant adverse effect on any competing bank. 
None of Applicant's present subsidiary banks competes 
significantly with Bank. The nearest subsidiary bank of Applicant is 
approximately 75 miles northwest of Columbia, and is the smallest of 
Appl 
icant s present subsidiaries. Due to distances involved and restric-
tions of State law with respect to branches, there is little potential 
for future competition between Bank and Applicant's present subsidiaries. 
It therefore appears that consummation of Applicant's proposal 
would not eliminate present competition or foreclose significant future 
competition in any area. Concentration would be increased only at the 
State-wide level, and that increase would be minimal. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the present proposal will not result in a monopoly or be in further-
ance of any combination, conspiracy or attempt to monopolize, and will 
not substantially lessen competition, restrain trade, or tend to create 
a monopoly in any section of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources arid future prospects. -
Appl 
icant s financial condition, management, and prospects are regarded 
as satisfactory, as is the case with its present subsidiaries. 

3371 
Bank's financial condition is generally sound, but some asset 
x-zeaknesses exist which appear to indicate a need for greater management 
supervision of this area of the bank's operations. Consummation of 
Applicant's proposal would add depth to Bank management, and that consid;-
eration lends some weight toward approval of the application. The 
prospects of Bank are considered favorable. 
These considerations are consistent with, and provide some 
weight in favor of, approval of the application. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - The 
banking needs of communities served by Applicant's present subsidiaries 
would not be affected by consummation of the present proposal. 
The banking needs of the community served by Bank appear to 
be adequately and conveniently served at present. However, Applicant 
proposes to assist Bank in establishing a trust department and to put its 
specialists in such fields as equipment leasing, mortgage lending, and 
international finance at Bank's disposal, and the broadened services 
which would result would benefit Bank's customers. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
communities involved are consistent with approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all the relevant 
facts contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth 
in section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction irould be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved,

11/6/69 
for immediate release. 
November 6. 1969. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
issued an amendment to its Regulation Z to make it easier for agri-
cultural lenders to comply with the Truth in Lending Act and insure 
full and clear descriptions of farm credit transactions. 
The amendment, effective immediately, provides that where the 
dates or amounts of payments or advances cannot be determined at the 
time of a credit transaction because they are tied to the needs of the 
farmer as they arise during the year, the creditor may disclose the 
method of computing the amount of the finance charge rather than a total 
dollar figure, it the same time, the creditor may omit disclosure of 
the annual percentage rate but must disclose the number, amount and due 
dates of the paynents and the total amount to be repaid to the extent 
known. It should be noted that this amendment does not apply to loans 
for agricultural purposes where dates and amounts of both advances and 
repayments are known at the time of the ':rar>saction. .. . 
. 
. 
The Bosrd said a problem arises because some agricultural 
loans are made on terms governed by production and seasonal needs that 
cannot: be determined at the time a credit transaction is made. For ex-
ample, a bank or other lender might agree at the start of a growing season 
to advance money to a farmer for supplies at times and in amounts needed 
during che year to sow, maintain and harvest a crop. Repayment terms 
are frequently tied to the sale of crops. In such cases, the dates or 
amounts of advances or payments cannot be ascertained and consequently the 
amount of the finance charge, the repayment schedule and sometimes the 
annual percentage rate must be estimated. These estimates, are, at best, 

crude and often misleading and in

disclosure of credit terms in certain types of agricultural credit extensions 
where information regarding the dates or amounts of advances or payments is 
determinable at the time of entering into an agreement for the extension c£ 
credit. 
b. The requirements of section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, 
with respect to notice, public participation, and deferred effective date were 
nc,t followed in connection with these amendments. The effect of the amendments 
in general is to provide relief from a restriction and, in view of the uimecess-
hardship on certain creditors in complying with tha original § 226,8 and § 226.' 
the Board found that following such procedures would result in delay that would 
contrary to the public interest.

Interpretation 
S 226.312 Advances under open end real estate m o r t g a R e j ^ X - ^ J ^ ^ - ' j l M 
purposes 
Under \\ 226.8(p) disclosures are permitted in connection 
with certain extensions of credit for agricultural purposes which 
may involve advances under an open end real estate mortgage or 
similar lien. Section 226.0(j) in part treats advances for agricultural 
purposes under an open end real estate mortgage or similar lien. 
The question arises as to the respective application of these 
paragraphs to such advances. 
If an extension of credit involving multiple advances, 
whether or not under an open end mortgage, meets the tests of 
§ 226.3(p), disclosures need only be made prior to consummation 
of the credit transaction and need not be made at the time of each 
individual advance, even though such advance for agricultural 
purposes may not meet the tests in § 226.0(j). 
Conversely, 
extensions of credit for agricultural purposes involving advances 
under an open end real estate mortgage or similar lien which do 

not meet the tests for disclosure under § 226. C(p) are subject to 
the relevant provisions of § 226.8(j) dealing with such advances.

South Haven, Michigan. 49090 
Gentlemen: 
This is in reference to the letters of April 24, 1969, and 
September 18, 1969, from President Pence of your bank, and the 
enclosures with the letters, requesting reconsideration by the Board 
of its action under date of March 19, 1969, which denied the applica-
tion of your bank to acquire assets and assume deposit liabilities 
of The West Michigan Savings Bank, Bangor, Michigan. President 
Pence's letters also advised of the willingness of members of your 
Board of Directors to meet relative to the matter with available 
members of the Board «, 
As indicated in the Board's interim reply of June 10, 1969, 
to President Peace, the Board's Rules of Procedure, section 262.3(b)(6), 
provide that: 
"(6) After action by the Board on an application, 
the Board will not grant any request for reconsideration 
of its action, unless the request nresents relevant 
facts that, for good cause shown, were not previously 
presented to the Board, or unless it otherwise appears 
to the Board that reconsideration would be appropriate," 
All of the material and views submitted in President Pence's 
letters in support of the request for reconsideration and meeting 
with available members of the Board have been carefully studied. 
While such material and views discussed existing competition relative 
to the proposed acquisition in greater detail than was done in the 
original application, such material and views set forth little in 
the way of relevant facts that are new or that were not previously 
presented to the Board. You will, of course, have noted the findings 
in the Board's Statement in support of its March 19 Order that the

proposed acquisition would eliminate potential competition between 
them and enhance the dominant position of Citizens Bank in an area 
where banking resources are already rather highly concentrated. 
The matter, therefore, was one involving not just existing competi-
tion but concentration and potential competition, as well, 
\ 
Since in the Boardrs judgment, the material and views 
submitted with President Pence's letters presented no essentially 
new facts or other significant information or data not before the 
Board at the time of its action on the application, the Board has 
concluded, that reconsideration of its prior action on the applica-
tion as requested in such letters would not be appropriate.

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN 
November 10, 1969 
The Honorable Harley 0. Staggers, 
Chairman, Committee on Interstate 
and Foreign Commerce, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This refers to your letter of September 23, 1969, enclosing 
copies of your letter to Chairman Budge of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission of September 3, and the response of September 18, together 
with a copy of an article which appeared in the London Economist of 
August 16 concerning a tender offer by Tracy Investment Company, a 
company controlled by Mr. Kirk Kerkorian, for shares of Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer, Inc. The tender offer was ultimately financed, (after preliminary 
Arrangements had been enjoined) in Eurodollars obtained from a German and 
an English bank. Your letter points out that 
" . . . in the article there is reference to 
the fact that there may be a loophole in the 
bank financing of the purchase of these shares 
either in the statutes related to margin or in 
those related to the making of tender offers 
wherein the bank participation must be disclosed." 
In his response to you, Chairman Budge stated that in a decision 
handed down on August 8. Judge Tenney of the United States District Court 
£or the Southern District of New York refused to enjoin the foreign financing 
°f the tender offer on the ground that the Board of Governors' Regulation G, 
"Securities Credit by Persons other than Banks, Brokers, or Dealers," applies 
°nly to lenders having their principal office within one of the Federal 
Reserve Districts, hence, does not apply to foreign banks. Judge Tenney 
also remarked, apparently by way of dictum, that in his view the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 does not authorize the Board of Governors to regulate 
securities loans of foreign banks. 
This decision is currently under study by the Board's staff, with 
a view to recommending appropriate action to the Board. It is understood 
that an appeal has been taken. The outcome of that appeal might affect the 
board's determination of the matter. 

The Honorable Hai:ley 0. Staggers 
- 2 -

It may be helpful, by way of background, to emphasize that the 
Board's statutory responsibilities in this area are limited, of course, to 
(1) determining whether excessive credit is being used in a destabilizing 
fashion to purchase or carry securities in connection with corporate take-
overs, whether through tender offers or otherwise, and promulgating appro-
priate regulations if such excessive use of credit is found, and (2) through 
the supervisory function, determining whether bank loans for this purpose 
are made in accordance with sound banking principles and in compliance with 
the provisions of the Board's Regulation U, "Credit by Banks for the Purpose 
of Purchasing or Carrying Margin Stocks." The function of determining 
whether, arid in what way, it is socially or eccnomically desirable for 
corporate control to be acquired by means of takeovers has been entrusted 
by Congress to other agencies, and to the Department of Justice. 
The Bor.rd has for some time been concerned about the policy 
implications of the use of bank credit in corporate takeovers. 
In a 
letter to you of October 31, 1967, in connection with S. 510, the bill 
providing for disclosure in connection with "tender" offers to acquire 
corporate securities (subsequently enacted as I.L, 90-439), the Board 
urged that the disclosure requirements be expanded to apply to bank 
lenders. 
In this- letter, the Board stated that 
"A significant amount of credit may flow into 
the securities markets through this channel, 
which has escaped margin regulation for technical 
reasons. Such credit could be brought within the 
scope of margin regulation under existing law, 
but in order to reach an informed conclusion in 
this area it would be helpful if the Board knew 
a good deal more than it does at present about 
the amount and character of such credit." 
Since enactment of P.L. 90-439, tender offer filings have been 
scrutinized from the credit aspect by staff of both the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Board. A full dossier relating to the 
offer by Tracy for stock of MGM was made available to the Board's staff 
pursuant to the Act, and appropriate supervisory steps had been taken in 
regard to the initial credit arrangements, which were enjoined by Judge 
Mansfield, as discussed in the letter to you from Mr. Budge of September 18, 
1969. Accordingly, the answer to your first question is that experience to 
date with information obtained under the Act has been satisfactory, and does 
not indicate any loophole relating to disclosure of bank or other financing. 
Your second question, whether there is a loophole in the statute 
regarding the applicability of margin requirements to extensions of credit 
by foreign lenders, involves more complex problems, however. While suffi-
cient data have net yet been accumulated to support a definitive conclusion, 

The Honorable Harley 0. Staggers - 3 -
3384 
preliminary analysis of fifty-four cash tender offers reported to the SEC 
between July 30, 1968 and March- 1, 1969 revealed that of the total of more 
than $1.4 billion involved in these offers, $1.1 billion, or nearly 80 per 
cent of all fund.} was provided by bank loans. Some $50 million or nearly 
4 per cent was obtained from foreign banks. Thus, while not forming a 
very substantial proportion of total bank loans for this purpose, foreign 
loans to finance tender offers are sufficiently important to suggest the 
need for continuing watchfulness. 
While the Board has legal authority to broaden the scope of its 
regulations, application of margin requirements to foreign lenders involves 
some difficult questions. 
If a loophole exists, we must be reasonably sure 
that any action taken to close it will be effective and fair in its practical, 
operation. 
He are watching developments in this area so that we may be 
prepared to recommend legislation if it proves necessary. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.

Gentlemen: 
This is in reference to your letter of June 13, 1969, 
requesting permission for your Corporation ("CIIC"), directly or 
indirectly, to purchase and hold the majority of the voting shares 
of Societe Antillaise de Produits Chimiques ("Saprochim"), a French 
corporation which is to be organized to construct and operate a 
fertilizer plant in Martinique with related facilities in Guadeloupe, 
Edge Corporations are organized un-3er Section 25(a) of 
the Federal Reserve Act for the purpose of engaging in international 
or foreign banking or other international or foreign financial opera-
tions* The acquisition by an Edge Corporation of control of a cor-
poration engaged in nonfinancial activiti.es would not therefore 
generally "be appropriate* 
Although Saproc.him will not be engaged in banking or financing, 
your application included the following statements: 
"Normally, CIIC . . . would provide its share of the 
financing for a project of this sort through the mechanism 
of medium-term loans, bearing warrants or other equity-
sharing arrangements as well as interest. 
. , . Our review 
of the financial projections for the project indicates that 
sufficient net earnings will be generated to anticipate a 
redemption, of our entire investment in Saprochim in the 
manner described above within a period of seven years after 
startup, although of course no assurance to this effect can 
be given.,r 
k "k :k -k -k 
". . o if the proposed investment were made, the parties 
involved in the transaction contemplate that management and 
operation of the project will be handlea by Sunoco, and the 
documents will include an expression of the parties' present 
intention that a majority of Saprochim'^ Board of Directors 
will be representatives of Sunoco."

In view of this and other information furnished, the Board 
of Governors has concluded that your proposed acquisition of Saprochim 
stock it basically a financing transaction and would therefore be 
appropriate in these circumstances, provided that representatives of 
CIIC, including those of any subsidiary'of CIIC, do not constitute a 
controlling portion of Saprochim7s Board of Directors; that neither 
CIIC nor any subsidiary of CIIC exercise any operating or management 
control of Saprochim; and that CIIC maintain at its head office ade-
quate evidence of those facts. 
Accordingly, on the condition that the foregoing provisos 
are adhered to, the Board of Governors grants consent for your Cor-
poration to purchase and hold, directly or through Arcturus Investment 
& Development Limited, Montreal, Canada, approximately 10 per cent 
of the Class A and 80 per cent of the Class B shares of Saprochim at 
a cost of up to approximately $2,274,000, provided the shares are 
acquired within one year from the date of this letter, and after the 
redemption of the majority of Class B shares to purchase and hold 
in the.same manner the approximately 10 per cent of Class A shares 
held by Foster Wheeler International Corporation or its subsidiary 
at a cost not to exceed Saprochim1s book value of such shares, which 
is estimated to be approximately $123,000. In this connection, ap-
proval is alsc granted for the purchase and holding of shares of 
Saprochim in excess of 10 per cent of your Corporation's capital and 
surplus. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding 
that the investment now being approved will be made within the guide-
lines established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect as they apply to che foreign lending and investment activities 
of your Corporation, The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), 
and its other subsidiaries, and that due consideration is being given 
to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Dear Sirr 
On August 8, 1.969, President Nixon issued Executive 
Order No. 11478 which outlined a continuing Equal Employment 
Opportunity Program. Copies of that Order are enclosed along 
with the President's memorandum for heeds of departments and 
agencies and a memorandum from the Civil Service Commission. 
The Board has on a number of occasions taken the 
position that, whether or not Executive Orders of the President 
relating to Equal Employment Opportunity are legally binding 
on the Reserve Banks, the Board and each Reserve Bank in its 
own operations would conform to the spirit of such orders. 
(See the Board's letter of June 7, 1965, S-1959). In connec-
tion with Executive Order No. 11478, the Board today reaffirmed 
this earlier position. You will note that the Order is in line 
with the ten-point program of action approved by the Conference 
of Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks December 16, 1968, 
in vhich the Board concurred by letter of December 24, 1968 
(S-2074). In May 1969 the Board adopted the same 10-point 
program with respect to its own Equal Employment Opportunity-
Program. 
All Reserve Banks are encouraged to move forward 
with their action plans, having in mind the Executive Order 
and all phases of the ten-point program. 
Very truly yours,

HOUS;i 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT 
. FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CIVIL 
SERVICE .COMMISSION 
You asked that I review the Government's equal rmployment opportunity program 
f,nd report to you recommendations for policy and program changes. 
Thin is 
m y report. 
There is no program in the Civil Service C o m m i s s i o n of greater importance 
than the effort to achieve full equality of employment opportunity in the Federal 
s e r v i c e . 
Assuring equal opportunity and eliminating any vestige of d i s c r i m i n a -
tion 
in employment practices is essential to the well-being of the Government 
and crucial to the nation. 
Race, color, religion, national origin, or sex must 
never affect the opportunity of an American to work for and advancc within the 
Federal eervice. 
Review 
In making the review, we took the following a c t i o j s : 
Studied the ways in which the Federal Government had organized 
in '.he past for equal employment opportunity and p r o g r a m effectiveness 
under each of these organizational approaches. 
Reviewed particularly the organization a nd results under the 
P r e s i d e n t ' s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, 
which 
e x e r c i s e d program leadership immediately prior to the Civil 
Service C o m m i s s i o n ' s assumption of responsibility In 196S. 
Conducted a thorough analysis of efforts and results under 
C o m m i s s i o n stewardship during the past three and cne-half 
years, 
In reviewing program activities and progress since the C o m m i s s i o n was a s s i g n e d 
responsibility by Executive Order 11246, we did the following: 
Requested and received recommendations f r o m department and 
agency heads on future program direction. 
Me'': with agency equal employment opportunity o f f i c e r s and 
d i r e c t o r s of personnel to d i s c u s s progress and problems and 
to r e c e i v e program suggestions. 
Met with representatives of the Office of Federal. Contract 
Compliance, the Department of Justice, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity C o m m i s s i o n , and the U . S . C o m m i s s i o n on Civil 
Rights, to obtain input from these Federal a g e n c i e s having 
civil rights responsibilities. 
Me': with the C o m m i s s i o n ' s ten regional directors to gain their 
insights and program r ecomrnendationp. 
Consulted, through our regional d i r e c t o r s , with Federal Executive 
Boards and Associations to get program ideas from managers of 
F e d e r a l installations acrosR the nation.

Consul ted at the staff level with minority g.' oup organizations 
to assure consideration of their joints of view and suggestions. 
Met with representatives of women1? organizations and Federal 
agencies to obtain recommendations relatirg to equal employment 
of women in the Federal Government. 
Wc thus compiled a comprehensive base for overall a s s e s s m e n t of the 
Federal equal employment opportunity program. 
looked at its beginnings; 
we evaluated wnat has been done and what is underway; we attempted to 
a s s e s s our overall progress. 
Finally, we defined the challenges which still 
mupt he met and mapped out a proposed course of action. 
P r o g r e s s 
Wc can report :hat the Government has made significant progress in equal 
employment opportunity. 
Much has been done to open the doors of opportunity 
to many for w h i m they had been closed. 
Since ?965, when the Civil Service Commission was given leadership 
responsibility for the Government's equal opportunity program, 
significant gaine have been made in o v e r a l l minority employment 
in the Federal service. 
One-half million jobs, almost 20% of the Federal workforce in 
lb.e Executive Branch, are held by minority grcup Americans. 
The proportion of non-white persons employed in the Federal 
Government is almost 50% higher than the percentage of nor\-
whitee in the overall workforce in the United States - - 16 /o 
KC contrasted with 10. 8%, besed on most recent data available. 
In addition, the Government employs over 70,000 Spanish 
Bur-ni.zned Americana. 
Total e-.mploymsut figures, impressive as they are, cannot tell the whole 
«tory, either oC progress or of failures. 
Federal departments *'.nd agencies have engaged in action programs 
in their organizations and in their communities designed to 
improve equal employment opportunity. 
The climate in the Federal service for equal employment opportunity 
has improved greatly over the past few year3. 
Equal opportunity is becoming recognized as an integral part 
of the responsibilities of each manager and supervisor in the 
Federal service. 
The employment system is continually being reviewed and modified by the 
Civil Service Commission to assure that it is in fact open on an equal basis 
to all our citizjns and at the same time meets the i>eeds of F e d e r a l agencies 
for qualified manpower. 
The ultimate strength of the equal opportunity 
effort depends net so much on systems, however, as it does on the extent 
to which it. becomes an inseparable part of management so that the commitment 
to cqux). opportunity i3 fully reflected in the day-to-day operations of the 
Government. 
Challenges 
The road to equal opportunity is neither an easy one nox a short one. 
While 
our destination is coming into sight, we have a great distance to go. 
For 
example;

" 7 <f \ 
Despite cigoificant gains in overall employment, of minority 
group persons in the Federal service, too many of our 
minority employees arc concentrated at the lower grade levels, 
victims of inadequate education and pact discrimination. 
Our 
women employees are also largely concentrated in the lower grade 
levels. 
Despite recruiting efforts, comparatively few minority persons 
are entering rhe Government at the middle level and in the 
professional occupations. 
There are still many areas of the nation where Federal employment 
of minority persons does not adequately measure up to the potential 
represented in the population generally. 
Our system for gathering information on minority employment is 
not. cufficiently refined to pinpoint problem areas or to serve 
as a means for effective program rnanagenent. 
There is still need for better understanding by employees and supervisors 
ahkc of the objectives of the equal employment opportunity program. 
There 
are still Federal agencies which have not moved ahead as aggressively ac 
the times demand in affirmatively seeking equal employment opportunity 
relating to both minority employees and women. 
These are the challenges and they dictate some forthright program changes. 
Upward Mob'litv 
First, we must exert every effort possible to encourage upward mcbilitv of 
f e d e r a l employees now at the lower grade levels so that they may work at 
their fullest potential. 
This can be done by training offered by the Govern-
ment to employees who want the opportunity to improve their skills and 
qualify themselves for advancement. 
Therefore, we must: 
improve on-the-job training programs for employees; 
make greater and more imaginative use of the Government 
Employees' Training Act for lower grade employees, 
including 
enrollment in non-Government training facilities; 
- 
establish tuition-subsidy programs to encourage employees to 
qualify themselves for greater responsibilities; 
provide additional cooperative work-ctudy programs to bring 
persons previously denied the advantages of specialized training 
into occupations in which skilled manpower is needed; 
brinj; training opportunities within easy reach of Federal 
employees by working with hL.?h schools rnd colleges to 
establish "off campus" facilities in Federal buildings; 
work with schools and colleges to assure that courses of study 
adequately prepare minority group Americans for occupations in 
the i ederal Government, particularly these in which there are 
manpower shortages; and 
- 
identify under-utilized employees, especially those at the 
lower levels, and provide them with work opportunities com-
mensurate with their abilities, training, and education. 
M O R S 

Under the merit system of employment, we have rm.de progress in recruiting 
minority group Americans to the Federal workforce. 
One-fifth of our 
employees are minority. 
Now we need to raise our sights. 
We cannot afford to let up in the effort to 
open doors at all levels in the Federal service. 
We must be particularly 
concerned with college recruitment to assure a fair opportunity to ail persons 
for professional careers in the Government. 
Xn thiii way we will bring into 
Government qualified young men and women of all r.iceo and ethnic backgrounds 
who can assume positions of leadership and trust in the future. 
There are 
occupations and levels of responsibility in the Government service in which 
minority Americans and women are minimally represented. 
We must make 
these occupations and levels known and assure that our recruiting is aimed at 
all eourccfi to attract persons into these fields. 
Also, we must continue our 
participation at the local level with other employers, with schools, and 
with public and private groups on matters affecting the employabiliiy of 
persons for the Federal service, including efforts to assure adequate open 
housing near places of Government employment. 
Supervisory Support 
The key to effective equal employment opportunity and to affirmative action 
to achi eve this goal is the individual supervisor. 
He must have understanding 
Of and sensitivity to the objective of the program and (he needs and aspirations 
of individual employees. 
Training car. be an effective tool in bringing this 
kind of understanding fco him. 
To *,chicve this end, we plan to take the following steps: 
require each employee who becomes a supervisor in the Federal 
Government to participate in appropriate training courses to bring 
him ucderstanding of and sensitivity to the goals of equal employ-
ment opportunity; 
call for performance evaluations of supervisors which reflect, 
where appropriate, the effectiveness of their efforts to carry 
out their equal opportunity responsibility; a-\d 
encourage recognition of employees, supervisors, or units 
demonstrating superior accomplishment ir. equal opportunity 
under the Incentive Awards Act. 
A* a correlative, the supervisor must recognise that corrective action will 
follow quickly and surely when discriminatory practices are disclosed. 
The 
new discrimination complaint precedure which the Commission has ordered 
effective July 1, 1969, will help assure that instances of discrimination are 
disclosed so that corrective action can be taken immediately. 
Program Matuccnicnfc 
While the Commission has leadership responsibility for the Governrnent-
vude equal employment opportunity program,, each department and agency 
head is individually responsible for the program in his organization. 
It is 
tip to him to do die job. 
He must assure that the will for equal employment 
opportunity exists in his organization and must also r.ee to it that adequate 
manpower and sufficient funds are provided to carry out an effective and 
affirmative program. 
Commission regulations require that by July 1, 1969 
the agency head appoint a Director of Equal Employment Opportunity. 
He 
ehould be a high level official having the full confidence of the agency and with 
sufficient authority to assure action.

S-2109c 
E2ch agency has been required to prepare a plan of action to guide its equai 
opportunity activities. 
We wili 33k each department and agency head to 
r e v i s e hia plan of action to accord with the emphasis reflected in this report. 
He will be requested to evaluate his progress in accordance with the revised 
plan of action and based on guides supplied to him by the Commission. 
I h i s 
will be part of a Government-wide agency self-evaluation program which we 
will institute and which will place responsibility for progress clearly on the 
agency head w :th review in the Civil Service Commission. 
We will ask for 
periodic p r o g r e s s reports from agency heads and I propose co report to you 
periodically on Government-wide progress on eqval opportunity. 
At the same time, we will intensify our evaluations of agency equai employ-
ment opportunity efforts to provide meaningful assistance to agencies in 
meeting program goals. 
We will point out deficiencies, where they exist, 
show the need for action, and help assure progress in this critical area. 
To provide a data base for evaluation purposes b> agencies as well as by. the 
Civil Service C o m m i s s i o n , we are authorizing the departments and agencies 
to maintain certain minority employment data on automatic data processing 
equipment, wh :ch under present restrictions they ai e unable to do. 
This 
approach will contribute current and comprehensive statistical information to 
a s s i s t in program management and will operate v ith proper safeguards to 
a s s u r e individual privacy and the separation of minority employment data from 
all other personnel r e c o r d s . 
Equal employment opportunity is and must remain a major responsibility of each 
Civil Service C o m m i s s i o n bureau and office. 
X am taking steps, however, to 
strengthen the focus and coordination within the C ommission of our leadership 
responsibility for the Government-wide equal employment opportunity program. 
We will thus be able to intensify our efforts to improve the program within each 
agency of Government. 
At the same time we will step up consultation with 
minority organizations and Federal employee unions to assure their full 
participation, in the Government's efforts. 
To aoeurc c o m m o n understanding of the objective? and directions of the equal 
employment opportunity effort, I will convene ao soon as practicable after 
July 1 a meeting of the Directors of Equal Employment Opportunity of all 
F e d e r a l agencies. 
This will give us the opportunity to strengthen the deter-
mination of those persons directly responsible for providing leadership to 
equal opportunity in the Federal Government. 
The Disadvantaged and Hard-Core Unemployed 
The new thrust for equal opportunity that I have outlined in this memorandum 
will apply to all Federal employees and applicants regardless of race, 
color, 
religion, national origin, or ties. 
At the same time, we must not forget our 
obligation ae the nation's largest employer to do our share in meeting the 
problems of the disadvantaged and the hard-core unemployed. 
Government 
agencies can hire and train disadvantaged personr. 
A number ol special 
programs in different agencies are now underway to provide training and 
employment to youth and to the hard-core unemployed. 
This effort m u s t be strengthened. 
We will seek to work cooperatively with 
other departments of Government so that Federal agencies may participate 
with other e m p l o y e r s in the application of programs funded for the- employ-
ment and development of disadvantaged Americans. 
We must find ways to 
give incentive to Federal agencies to develop imaginative programs so that the 
facilities of the Government can be used even more extenuively for training 
disadvantaged persons for possible Federal employment. 
In addition, 
exempting f r o m manpower ceiling controls positions held by disadvantaged 
persons, at least during the initial employment period when productivity is 
n e c e s s a r i l y low; and -offering c l a s s r o o m training during work hours for up to 
25% of a new e m p l o y e e ' s time are examples of poasible approaches.

Conclusion 
la summary, we have made progress in moving toward true equal employment 
opportunity i n the Federal Government. 
Wc have now reached £, stage which 
requires rededication and new directions to assure further achievement. 
The program directions I have outlined in this memorandum point the way in 
the vital areas of upward mobility of cmpioyeec, recruiting, supervisory 3uoport, 
and program management aa wfcll as new opportunities for the disadvantaged' 
and hard-core unemployed. 
We will move forward and work closely with 
agencies to develop the needed programs. 
To demonstrate the commitment of your Administration to the objectives of 
this important e/icrt, I recommend a new Executive Order be issued relating 
solely to equal opportunity in Federal employment and incorporating the new 
directions « o believe are necessary to achieve this important national goal.
