First National City Corporation. The Board unanimously approved 
the following applications by First National City Corporation, New York, 
New York, a bank holding company. Copies of the letters informing the 
Corporation of the Board's actions are attached as indicated: 
Application to purchase shares of Citicorp International Bank 
Limited, London, England, and to continue to hold those shares

Capital London, Ltd., London, England. (Item No. 13)

American Fletcher Corporation. In June 1972 the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago accepted and forwarded to the Board's staff the application 
of American Fletcher Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana, to acquire 
Southwest Savings and Loan Association, Phoenix, Arizona. In a letter of 
June 28 the Corporation requested that the Board schedule a public hearing 

3431 
11/30/72 
-5-
on the application and on the general question whether bank holding 
companies should be permitted to acquire savings and loan associations 
under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. On August 3 the 
Board announced that it had decided not to include at the present time 
operation of savings and loan associations in the list of activities 
permissible for bank holding companies. The separate treatment Congress 
had traditionally given savings and loan associations and commercial banks 
was cited, along with the possibility that current studies might lead to 
pertinent legislative proposals. The application of American Fletcher 
Corporation was returned, with an indication that it would not be acted 
upon at that time but that it might be resubmitted if in the future the 
operation of a savings and loan association was determined to be a permis-
sible activity. 
In August 1972 American Fletcher Corporation filed a petition for 
judicial review, urging that the court set aside these actions. In confer-
ences with the Board's staff, American Fletcher Corporation representatives 
indicated that all they could realistically hope to achieve was that the 
court would remand the question to the Board for further processing, 
including the holding of a hearing. They suggested that the Corporation 
would move to dismiss the pending petition for judicial review if the Board 
Would schedule an oral presentation during early 1973 on the question of 
Permissibility; they were not seeking a formal hearing under the Adminis-
trative Procedure Act. 

3432 
11/30/72 
-6-
In a memorandum of November 29, 1972, the Legal Division recom-
mended that the request for an oral presentation be granted, on condition 
that the petition for judicial review be dismissed. The Division was 
concerned that the record in the pending appeal was so "poor" that the 
court might set adverse precedents by requiring (1) access to Board minutes 
and staff memoranda, or (2) a formal hearing. 
There appeared to be little or no question that operation of 
savings and loan associations was an activity closely related to banking. 
The Board's determination that, at least for the present, it was not a 
permissible activity rested upon the public benefits test of the statute. 
An important element of the public benefits test in this case was the 
intent of Congress. At least two Congressional leaders, who were among 
those who had favored wide discretion for the Board with respect to permis-
sible activities, had indicated that before any determination was made 
that operation of savings and loan associations was permissible the Con-
gress should study the basic issues further. One member of Congress had 
expressed the view that Congress had not intended such permissibility in 
the 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Discussion of procedural alternatives included the observation 
that even though it was not expected that the Board would come to a 
different conclusion after a hearing, the holding of a hearing would provide 
a record that could be cited as other questions were posed. It was men-
tioned also that if American Fletcher Corporation would resubmit its appli-
cation, the Board could consider its merits and in support of its decision 

3433 
11/30/72 
-7-
give a full explanation of its position, which was now lacking with 
respect to that specific proposal. 
At the conclusion of the discussion Chairman Burns and Governors 
Robertson, Daane, and Sheehan voted to deny the request for a hearing, 
while Governors Brimmer and Bucher voted affirmatively. It was under-
stood that the staff would explore with American Fletcher Corporation 
the possibility of resubmitting its application. 
Governor Mitchell withdrew during the latter part of the discussion. 
Northwest Bancorporation. Today's agenda called for further 
consideration of the application of Northwest Bancorporation, Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, to acquire shares of Farmers and Merchants Bank of Stillwater, 
Stillwater, Minnesota, action on which had been deferred at the meeting 
on November 22, 19 72. 
After brief discussion, action was again deferred until a time 
when all members of the Board could participate. 
Hamilton Bancshares. At the meeting on November 22, 1972, the 
Board considered the application of Hamilton Bancshares, Inc., Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, to acquire shares of Hardeman County Savings Bank, Bolivar, 
Tennessee. Additional information requested by the Board with respect to 
competitive aspects and the financial and managerial resources of the 
applicant and its subsidiaries was submitted by the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation and the Banking Markets Section in a memorandum of November 29. 
The favorable staff recommendations were reiterated. 

3434 
11/30/72 
-8-
While discussion indicated a disposition on the part of all 
members of the Board present to approve the application, concern was 
expressed because the applicant holding company was in the process of 
converting three of its national bank subsidiaries to State nonmember 
banks, and the prospect was that there would be additional withdrawals. 
There was agreement that a rationale in support of approval should make 
clear the Board's misgivings in approving acquisition of banks by bank 
holding companies that removed their subsidiaries from System membership, 
and perhaps also the Board's concern that the fulfillment of its responsi-
bilities might be hindered if subsidiary banks were not members of the 
System. 
The application was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that implementing documents would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
First Florida Bancorporation. On October 31, 1972, the Board 
voted to deny the application of First Florida Bancorporation, Tampa, 
Florida, to merge with United Bancshares of Florida, Inc., Miami Beach, 
Florida. Before an order to implement that decision was prepared, the 
Chairman of United Bancshares of Florida met with Governors Brimmer and 
Robertson and with staff members. He contended that in the six months 
since the application was filed the structure of banking in Dade County 
had changed markedly, and that, if the Board were disposed to deny the 
application on competitive grounds, he should be allowed to make a further 
presentation with respect to that aspect of the case. The Division of 
Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets Section had considered 

3435 
11/30/72 
-9-
that contention and the data submitted in support of it, and adhered to 
their original recommendations of denial. 
Questions having been raised during discussion, the Board agreed, 
Governor Brimmer dissenting, to reconsider the case. Members of the 
Board mentioned particular points upon which they requested further staff 
analysis. 
Review of grandfathered activities. In a memorandum of November 20, 
19 72, the Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets 
Section recommended that 13 bank holding companies be allowed to continue 
their grandfathered nonbanking activities. After discussion at today's 
meeting, the Board unanimously approved the recommendation with respect to 
the following companies: 
Contract Leasing Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri 
Clayton Bankshares Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri 
South St. Louis Investment Company, St. Louis, Missouri 
Hampton Bankshares Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri 
Crestwood Bank Shares Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri 
Coronado Financial Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri 
Columbia Union Bancshares, Kansas City, Missouri 
First National Bank Voting Trust, Hollywood, Florida 
First Bancorporation, Reno, Nevada 
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Hong Kong 
It was understood that orders would be prepared to reflect these decisions. 
Action with respect to the following companies was deferred for 
further consideration: 
Swiss-Israel Trade Bank, Geneva, Switzerland 
Whitney Holding Corporation, New Orleans, Louisiana 
Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc., Peoria, Illinois 

3436

Chase Manhattan. The Board unanimously approved the application 
of Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation, New York, New York, to 
purchase shares of a new merchant bank, United Chase Merchant Bank Limited, 
Singapore. A copy of the letter sent to the applicant is attached as 
jtem No. 15. 
First National City. In a memorandum of November 6, 1972, the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets Section 
recommended approval of the application of First National City Corporation, 
New York, New York, to acquire shares of Acceptance Finance Company, 
Clayton, Missouri, on condition that a direct subsidiary of Acceptance 
Finance Company, Gateway Life Insurance Company, be liquidated unless the 
Board determined that its insurance activities are permissible under 
Regulation Y. 
The application was approved, Governor Robertson dissenting. 
It was understood that an order reflecting this decision would be prepared 
for the Board's consideration. 
Director appointments. It was agreed to ascertain through the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco whether Mr. Sam H. 
Bennion, Secretary-Treasurer, V-l Oil Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho, would 
accept appointment if tendered as a director of the Salt Lake City Branch 
for the two-year term beginning January 1, 1973, and that, if Mr. Bennion 
was unable to accept, a similar inquiry would be made with respect to 
Mr. Clyde Bacon, Jr., President, Bacon Livestock, Inc., Jerome, Idaho. 

3437 
11/30/72 
-ll-
Cit having been ascertained that Mr. Bennion would accept, an 
appointment telegram was sent to him on December 14, 1972.) 
Mr. Frederick G. Koenig, Jr., President, Alabama By-Products 
Corporation, Birmingham, Alabama, was reappointed a director of the 
Birmingham Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for the three-
year term beginning January 1, 1973. 
The meeting proceeded from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Art program. Governor Sheehan referred to the extensive assistance 
the Board's Art Committee had received from Mr. Nathan Cummings in enlisting 
the interest of museums and private collectors in making loans or gifts 
of works of art for display in Federal Reserve buildings. The Committee 
suggested that Mr. Cummings' efforts might be suitably recognized by naming 
the reception room off the oval entrance to the Board Members' offices 
the Nathan Cummings Room, by installing a plaque in that room, and by 
transmitting to Mr. Cummings a resolution expressing the Board's appreciation, 
A draft of such a resolution was distributed to members of the Board. 
Discussion indicated sentiment on the part of several members of 
the Board against naming a room in the Board's building for any individual, 
although the presentation of a resolution would be appropriate. One member 
of the Board also expressed a view against the installation of a plaque, 
on the ground that in public attitude it would become in time the equivalent 
of naming the room. 

. 3438 
11/30/72 
-12-
Suggestions were made for revisions in the draft resolution, and 
it was understood that further consideration would be given to the language 
proposed for the resolution and the plaque. 
International meetings. Governor Daane reported on the tenor 
of discussions at recent meetings of the Deputies of the Committee of 
Twenty. 
The meeting then adjourned.

ATTACHMENT 
APPENDIX TO 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
Every time you pick up the newspaper you read about one company 
Urging with another company. Of course, we have laws to protect competi-
tlon in the United States, but one can't help thinking that, if the trend 
the whole country will soon be merged into one large company. 
It is 1970 and by this time every company west of the Mississippi 
j^l have merged into one giant corporation known as Samson Securities. 
Very company east of the Mississippi xd.ll have merged under an umbrella 
COrporation known as the Delilah Company, 
s 
It is inevitable that one day the chairman of the board of 
Vinson and the president of Delilah would meet and discuss merging 
two companies. 
â€ž 
"If we could get together," the president of Delilah said, â€¢ 
would be able to finance your projects and you would be able to 
lnance ours." 
"Exactly what I was thinking," the chairman of Samson said, 
^ 
"That's a great idea and it certainly makes everyone's life 
e s s complicated." 
^ 
The men shook on it and then they sought out approval from the 
nt*--Trust Division of the Justice Department. 
^ 
At first the head of the Anti-Trust Division indicated that he 
ght have reservations about allowing the only two companies left in the 
lted States to merge. 
pQ 
"Our department," he said, "will take a close look at this pro-
merger. It is our job to further competition in private business 
industry, and if we allow Samson and Delilah to merge we may be doing 
e consumer a disservice," 
D . 
The chairman of Samson protested vigorously that merging with 
b
 lUah would not stifle competition, but would help it. "The public will 
ttl0
 the true beneficiary of this merger," he said, "The larger we are, the 
services we can perform, and the lower prices we can charge." 
5v 
The president of Delilah backed him up, "In the Communist 
the people don't have a choice. They must buy from the state. In 
capitalistic society the people can buy from either the Samson Company 
Delilah Company." 

~ 3440 
-2-
"But if you merge," someone pointed out, "there will be only 
company left in the United States," 
f 
"Exactly," said the president of Delilah. "Thank God for the 
enterprise system." 
tne 
The Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department studied the 
"Whii* fÂ° r m o n t h s * 
Finally the Attorney General made this ruling. 
toiiJ W e f i n d SÂ° m e d r a w b a c k s t 0 Â°nly one company being left in the 
ited States, we feel the advantages to the public far outweigh the 
Advantages. 
Sa, 
"Therefore, we're making an exception in this case and allowing 
Â° n and Delilah to merge. 
"I would like to announce that the Samson and Delilah Company 
UrutÂ°W neSÂ°tiating at the White House with the President, to buy the 
ted States. The Justice Department will naturally study this merger 
See if it violates any of our strong anti-trust laws,"

North Carolina National Bank 
P. 0. Box 120 
Charlotte, North Carolina 28201 
Gent] .emen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to North Carolina National Bank, ("NCNB"), Charlotte, 
North Carolina, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the 
federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Georgetown, Grand 
Cayman, Cayman Islands, and to operate and maintain such branch 
subject to the provisions of such Section and of Regulation M. 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch will be used fcr developing new international business and 
net as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
United States* It is also understood that there is to be no contact 
with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, staff, 
and bookkeeping may, at least in part, be supplied under contract by 
another party. 
In view of the special character of this operation, the 
foregoing permission is granted subject to (1) a continuing review 
these types of facilities, and after due notice may be withdrawn 
modified, (2) the condition that reserves shall be maintained 
against deposits in this branch under Section 213.7 of Regulation M 
without benefit of the exclusion provided in proviso (1) of: Sec-
tion 213,7(b), and (3) the further condition that adequate information 
covering the. branch's operations will be maintained at your head office 
and will be available to ttie 3oard and its accredited representatives. 
Yne Board should be promptly informed of any modification in the 
branch's methods of operation, including changes in any contract under 
which services are supplied co the branch. 
Permission to establish the proposed branch is also granted 
subject to the condition that NCNB shall liquidate its Nassau branch 
within six months of the date of this letter. 

. 3443 
North Carolina National Bank 
-2-
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before January 1, 1974, all rights granted hereby shall 
be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted will 
automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Richmond, when the branch is opened for business, 
furnishing information as to the exact location of the branch. The 
Hoard should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Georgetown,, 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits 
payable only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the 
States of the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt 
from any limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 
and Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D. The general 
Purpose of these exemptions is to allow foreign branches of United 
States banks to compete abroad with foreign banks. In these cir-
cumstances, it has long been and continues to be the policy of the 
Federal Reserve System to discourage deposits by United States 
Residents at foreign branches of United States banks unless such 
deposits have been placed to serve a definite, necessary purpose in 
connection with foreign or international transactions outside the 
United States. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, funds 
Provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated capital, 
advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign assets for pur-
poses of the foreign credit restraint effort,. In view of the Board's 
concern with minimizing the impact of foreign investments on the 
balance of payments, the above consent is given on the condition that 
3'n the conduct of the branch's operations maximum reliance will be 
Placed on resources obtained outside the United States. Accordingly, 
is understood that nny investment required will be made within the 
foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines as they apply to your bank and 
aixii. iaces*

IBD will furnish the Board with such reports

STATEMENT 
First International Bancshares, Inc., Dallas, Texas 
("Applicant"), has filed with the Board, pursuant to Â§ 3(a)(1) of 
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, an application for approval 
action to become a bank holding company through the acquisition 
Â°f 100 per cent (less directors1 qualifying shares) of the voting 
shares of First National Bank in Dallas, Dallas, Texas ("First 
National"), and Houston-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, Houston, 
Texas ("Houston-Citizens"). By virtue of acquisition of First 
K a t W i Applicant would also acquire indirect control of 26.4 per 
cent of the voting shares of Guaranty Bank, Dallas ("Guaranty Banlc", 
formerly South Oak Cliff Bank), an interest now held directly by 
National under a debt previously contracted. Applicant will 
also acquire indirectly through HB&T Stockholders Company, Houston 
( a trusteed affiliate of Houston-Citizens), a 6.7 per cent interest 
i n First Alief Bank, Alief. 
First National now holds certain minority interests in 
f_ 
"Urteen banks ("Other Banks") located in Dallas County, Texas, as 
^Â°Uows: 24 per cent of the shares of American Bank and Trust Com-
pany; 21.34 per cent of the shares of Citizens State Bank, Irving; 
20 Per cent of the shares of The Dallas County State Bank, Carrollton; 
5 / 
per cent of the shares of DeSoto State Bank; 24.52 per cent of 
shares of East Dallas Bank & Trust Company; 24 per cent of the 
shares of First National Bank of Richardson; 24 per cent of the shares 

- 
* tr/Q 
-2-
of Grove State Bank; 22,42 per cent of the shares of North Dallas Bank 
and Trust Company; 24,9 per cent of the shares of Northpark National 
Bank; 19,47 per cent of the shares of Park City's Bank and Trust Com-
pany; 24,5 per cent of the shares of Southwest Bank and Trust Company, 
Irving; 
24 per cent of the shares of Texas National Bank; 10,67 per 
cent of the shares of White Rock National Bank; and 26,41 per cent of 
the shares of Guaranty Bank, formerly South Oak Cliff Bank. 
Board approval of Applicant's proposal to become a bank hold-
ing company does not signify Board approval of the retention or acquisi-
tion of the above-referred to minority interests in Other Banks. It Is 
the Board's understanding, from representations by Applicant, that 
Applicant will file separate applications for prior approval by the 
Soard for each of such minority holdings it seeks to retain and cause 
its minority interests in all Other Banks, other than those for which 
8nch applications are filed, to be completely and permanently divested 
by it. It is further understood that in this manner any such applica-
tions so filed by Applicant will be subject to the ordinary regulatory 
a n d legal process, subject to statutory standards as set forth in both 
section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act and section 7 of the Clayton 
Act, 
Statutory considerations. Applicant is a recently organized 
cÂ°rporation, formed for the express purpose of acquiring First National 
($1.7 billion in deposits) and Houston-Citizens ($219 million in de-
Posits). (All banking data are as of December 31, 1971, and reflect 

3451 
-2-
holding company formations and acquisitions approved through August 31, 
1^72.) First National is the second largest banking organization in 
the Dallas banking market and the second largest in the State, holding 
5.6 per cent of total State deposits. While it holds approximately one-
fourth of deposits in the Dallas banking market, many of these deposits 
a*e not derived from that particular market. For example, as of April 
1972, deposits totaled $1,417 million. Of these, $180 million were due 
to banks and $218 million represented public funds. Moreover, the bank 
has historically had a substantial number of large deposits (i.e., those 
$100,000 and over); in the main these are owned by corporations, 
financial institutions, and State and local governments. The total in 
Â®uch accounts amounts to about three-fourths of the bank's entire 
deposit aggregate. 
The principal market in which First National competes con-
8ists of the entire Dallas SMSA, wherein a total of 118 banks are 
located. In addition, First National is in competition with large 
banks throughout the Southwest, and to a lesser extent throughout the 
Nation. 
It is also engaged in international banking through branch or 
representative offices in London, Tokyo, Nassau and Singapore. 
Houston-Citizens is the fifth largest of 149 banks in the 
Houston SMSA, controlling 3.12 per cent of total commercial deposits 
in that market and 0.7 per cent of total State depooita. Houston-
Citizens is the resulting institution from a merger in 1970 between 
Houston Bank & Trust Company and Citizens Bank. Today, Houston-
Citizens has a relatively low liquidity position as reflected in its 

3452 
-2-
asset composition. Its loan account as a per cent of total assets is 
substantially above the average for banks of similar size in its dis-
trict, while its cash and securities as a per cent of total assets is 
substantially below the average for similar sized banks. Due to its 
capital and asset problems, Houston-Citizens is not in a position to 
serve as the lead bank of an independent Statewide or regional bank 
holding company. 
It appears that consummation of the proposal would not have 
any adverse effect on existing competition inasmuch as First National 
and Houston-Citizens are located in separate banking markets 250 miles 
aPart. Deposit concentration in the Houston and Dallas markets would 
nÂ°t be altered, and Statewide concentration would increase by only 
^â€¢7 per cent. 
The Board notes that there has been a significant increase 
in bank holding company representation in Houston in recent years, and 
that in Houston, as in other major Texas banking markets, newly formed 
folding companies are assimilating their former chain bank affiliates 
into the holding company structure. Despite this trend, there are 
l34 banks in the market not affiliated with a multibank holding company. 
Sixteen of these have deposit aggregates of more than $50 million. 
Several could serve as vehicles for entry by bank holding companies 
kased outside of Houston or as components of a newly formed Houston 
kased holding company. 
The large number of small banks in Houston is the result of 
bÂ°th the legislative prohibition against branch banking in Texas and 

the high rate of economic growth in the Houston SMSA. Because of the 
number of recent bank formations, population per banking office for the 
Houston area has fallen from 22,876 in 1960 to 13,322 in 1970 (a lower 
ratio than often found in large cities located in unit banking States). 
IJhile First National may be viewed as a potential entrant into 
the Houston banking market, if it entered either de novo or through ac-
quisition of a small bank, its competitive impact on the Houston banking 
Market would be deferred for sometime. 
Furthermore, the Board is interested in expanding the competi-
tive environment, not only in Houston and Texas markets, but also in the 
southwest and national markets as well. Construed within the context of 
the national market, the proposed formation will enhance a Texas bank 
holding company's ability to compete with other banks providing nation-
wide credit services, particularly for major Texas corporations. The 
economic development of Texas and the southwest region will be fostered 
by 
acquisitions such as this one which will encourage the development 
local institutions capable of servicing the growing domestic and 
international interests of Texas corporations. 
Specifically, consummation of the proposal herein would sub-
stantially enhance the potential for Houston-Citizens in meeting the 
financial needs of its customers, particularly those of the medium-
sized and larger commercial and industrial firms in Houston and the 
Houston-Gulf Coast region. Moreover, the shared expertise from First 
National in specialized commercial loans, international, correspondent 
bank, portfolio management, and trust services would permit Houston-
Citizens to better serve its customers and provide more vigorous 

3454 
-2-
competition in these services to the three largest banks in the Houston 
market. Due to Houston-Citizens status as a State chartered bank, its 
efforts to extend international banking services in Houston (the third 
largest port city in the nation) have been limited by State laws pre-
venting it from having foreign branches. Thus, extension of international 
services through First National's existing and planned branch and repre-
sentative office network would provide Houston-Citizens with signifi-
cantly enlarged international banking capabilities for its customers. 
It is the Board's judgment that the convenience and needs factors lend 
weight toward approval of the application. 
Applicant plans to increase the equity capital accounts of 
Houston-Citizens by $10 million, and will strengthen management by 
providing a senior officer and other needed personnel. Considerations 
relating to the financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
of Applicant and the banks concerned are satisfactory and consistent 
with approval. 
Summary and Conclusion. On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained in the record and in light of the factors set forth in 
section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved. 
November 30, 1972 

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
Applications to form holding companies in Texas, as well as 
aPplications by holding companies to acquire additional banks in Texas, 
a r e presently being processed on a "first come--first served" basis. 
Perhaps this is in the American tradition, but it ill serves the needs 
of a State in the throes of reshaping its own banking structure. The 
Resent application demonstrates a need for Board analysis going be-
yÂ°nd the ad hoc approach and for a more thorough examination of Texas 
inking markets not only as they exist today but as they are reasonably 
Ukely to develop over the next decade, utilizing our knowledge of other 
a^gnments, past as well as prospective, in approving or disapproving any 
sP*cific formation. 
In previous years, chain banking relationships were established 
Texas as a means of circumventing the State's prohibition against 
kfanch banking. Today, holding companies in Texas are seeking to ac-
their chain bank affiliates. In Houston, for example, the three 
*atSest holding companies have a total of 24 affiliates which hold 9.9 
Per 
cent of commercial deposits in the Houston market. These three 
companies have indicated that they plan to acquire 16 of these 
filiates having total deposits of $507.2 million, or 7.2 per cent of 
tet 
^ot 
atket deposits. While not attempting to prejudge in any manner these 
Posed acquisitions, it would appear to me that one or more of these 
filiates could well serve as an appropriate vehicle for entry into the 
Uaton banking market by other bank holding companies, thus enhancing 
Petition and better serving the public's banking needs. 

-2 
3456 
In my view, those large holding companies having the resources 
a n d capability for effectuating successful entry on a de novo basis should 
be required to follow that course. There is no dispute that Applicant, 
trough First National Bank in Dallas (with deposits of $1.7 billion), 
h a s t h e resources and capability to enter the Houston market de novo, 
record informs us that two of the 15 banks in the downtown area of 
Ho 
uston were chartered within the past three years, and six were chartered 
Within the past ten years. At present there are applications on file 
wl-th the Texas Commissioner of Banking to charter two additional de novo 
^anks in downtown Houston. It is evident that Applicant's opportunity 
to 
enter this fast growing market is equal to that of these other de novo 
Grants, and that its likelihood of becoming an effective competitor in 
Houston market is greater still. 
The majority's reliance upon the convenience and needs factor 
support for including a bank the siee of Houston-Citizens in Appli-
a u t fs formation is ill-founded. Complete banking services are current-
ly available to the residents of the Houston SI1SA banking market. And 
^ternational banking services are readily available in this market from 
least five other Houston banks, as well as from two Edge Act corpora-
tl0*a representing the Bank of America N.T. & S.A. and First National 
C i t y Bank, New York City, Thus, at best, the benefits to the public 
insignificant when compared to the serious anticompetitive effects 
from the combination, of Houston-Citizens (with its deposits 
million) and the $1,7 billion (deposit size) First National Bank 
0f $219 

3457

On the basis of the foregoing, I dissent to approval of the 
N a t i o n of First International Bancshares, Inc. The affiliation of 
e second largest bank in Texas, the First National Bank of Dallas, 
a large Houston bank, whose problems are not by any means ir-
^Parable, leads the Board down the road to the form of concentration 
S e ultiraate reductio ad absurdum is described in the Appendix to

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I dissent from the majority's action to create the largest bank 
holding company in Texas by combining the second largest bank in Dallas 
*tth a sizeable Houston bank. The net result is to bind the State's two 
^rgest financial centers even closer, while the development of a more 
^althy banking environment Statewide is curtailed. I have previously 
eitlphasized the need to encourage the development of a more balanced 
banking structure in Texas. I have also anticipated the possibility 
that the large Houston and Dallas banking organizations mayâ€”in timeâ€” 
1/ 
become dominant in all Texas markets. 
Approval of the formation of 
Hrst International Bancshares, Inc. in the manner proposed provides 
Mother foundation upon which this forecastâ€”unfortunatelyâ€”may become 
a Reality. 
The majority bases its decision, in part, upon the present 
financial condition of Houston-Citizens Bank 6c Trust Company, and it 
pÂ°ints to the capital improvements that will accrue to this Houston-
based bank once it comes under Applicant's control. However, it is 
imPortant to examine the patient before speaking of cures. Houston-
Cltizens is the result of a Board-approved merger between Houston Bank 
^ Trust Company and Citizens Bank on September 22, 1970, (which I sup-
p e d ) . 
The unsatisfactory financial condition of Citizens Bank was 
a factor influencing Board approval of that merger. Even today, a 
^

Texas Commerce Bancshares to acquire San A n g e l o National Bank, October 
6> 1972. 

~ 3459

8ubstantial portion of the classified assets of Houston-Citizens can be 
attributed to the deterioration of two major lines of credit made prior 
to the merger. Yet, Houston-Citizens' capital ratios compare favorably 
with other large Houston-area banks, and its earnings are above average. 
cÂ°spective earnings appear sufficient to support the sale of additional 
CaPital, Houston-Citizens has capable management and, given sufficient 
^ e , can be restored to a viable competitive position. Bank super-
visionâ€”both on the State and federal regulatory levelâ€”is designed for 
^is very purpose. Thus, there is no need for Houston-Citizens to lose 
*ts independence now, having undergone a successful merger designed two 
years ago to cure its financial illness. The prescription today (if one 
s needed) is to give it additional time--not another merger. 
Although the majority considers the inability of Houston-
Citizens to form a holding company of its own one of the factors upon 
approval can be based, I would completely divorce this factor 
consideration of the application. The question is not one of how 
atlV bank holding companies can be formed in Texasâ€”since this pre-
8uPposes that all $200 million banks in Texas will eventually form or 
become members of a bank holding company. Thus, any Board analysis 
b a s e d in part on the ability, or inability, of a bank to form a holding 
C0QlPany of its own is subject to certain deficiencies, as it ignores a 
Vety real alternativeâ€”that of continued existence as an independent bank. 
I would consider it appropriate, however, in any analysis of a 
holding formation, to take into account the number of banking organiza-
Â° n s in the State, with special reference to their deposit size class. 

. 3460 
-2-
Without a clear perspective of the number of banks that remain outside 
the holding company structure, it is possible that all large banks might 
soon be absorbed by holding companies. Such a development could very 
likely strangle the growth of banks in the small deposit size categories. 
As the data in Table 1 indicate, there is only a limited number of Houston 
or Dallas based banks with deposits over $100 million, and there are fewer 
still in the San Antonio and Fort Worth markets. Banks in these four key 
financial centers in Texas have a unique advantage over banks in smaller 
Texas SMSA's where growth is more limited. That advantage can only be com-
pounded by allowing, as in the present proposal, consolidation of the re-
sources of a large Dallas bank with another large Houston bank. I would 
Prefer to see these first tier banks in Texas preserved, either as inde-
pendents, or as the base for their own holding company,rather than see 
them pyramid their resources further. Such consolidations add nothing 
to the convenience and needs of the Texas financial centers, but they 
are certain to lessen banking competition in the State as a whole. 
My dissent also applies to two additional actions of the Board 
related to the subject transaction â€” approval of the acquisition of 7 
Per cent of the voting shares of First International Bancshares, Inc., by 
Perpetual Corporation, Los Angeles, California, and approval of the merger 
of Jefferson Street State Bank, Houston, Texas, with Houston-Citizens Bank 
& Trust Company, Houston, Texas, each of which is the subject of a sepa-
rate order of the Board mailed this date and as to each of which my 
dissent is noted.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PERPETUAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank Shares 
Perpetual Corporation, Los Angeles, California, has applied 
for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1042 (a)(3)), to acquire 7.1 per cent of the voting 
shares of First International Bancshares, Inc., Dallas, Texas ("First 
International"), a proposed multibank holding company. 
Notice of the receipt of the application has been given in 
accordance with Â§ 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
and views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
all comments received in light of the factors set forth in 5 3(c) of 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1042 (c)), and finds that: 
Applicant, a bank holding company since December 31, 1970, 
by operation of law, presently holds 63.3 per cent of the voting stock 
of Houston-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, Houston, Texas 
( " H o u s t o n -
Citizens") , of which 10.8 per cent of said shares are directly held 
by Applicant and 44.5 per cent through a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
Pierce National Life Insurance Company, Los Angeles, California. 
Subject application is a companion to an application filed by First 
International, which proposes to form a new multibank holding com-
pany with First National Bank in Dallas and Houston-Citizens as its 
subsidiary banks. 
As a result of the latter proposal, which the 

3165 
-2-
Board has approved under a separate Order of this date, Applicant 
will acquire 7.1 per cent of the shares of First International in 
exchange for its present 63.3 per cent interest in Houston-Citizens. 
In addition, the president of Applicant will serve as a director of 
pirst International; thus, Applicant's stock interest in First Inter-
national, plus the existence of a common director between Applicant 
flnd First International, establishes Applicant as a bank holding 
1/ 
company under section 2(g)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act, 
Since the transaction involves only a restructuring in 
corporate ownership, consummation of the proposal will have no 
adverse effects on existing or potential competition. Applicant's 
financial resources and future prospects as they apply to Applicant's 
investment in First International appear favorable. Approval of the 
Proposed transaction will have no effect on the convenience and needs 
of 
the communities involved. It Is the Board's judgment that the 
transaction would be in the public interest and that the application 
8hould be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
1/ "Shares transferred after January 1, 1966, by any bank holding com-
pany ( o r by any company which, but for such transfer, would be a bank 
hiding company) , , , to any transferee that , , . has one or more 
Officers . . . in common with . . . the transferor shall be deemed to 
indirectly owned or controlled by the transferor unless the Board, 
after opportunity for hearing, determines that the transferor is not in 
fact capable of controlling the transferee."

this Order unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board

authority,

1. 
Such bank at all times shall conduct its business

In connection with the foregoing conditions of membership,

If at any time a change in cr amendment to the bank's

letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the board of 
directors after the bank has appropriate State authorization to commence 
business. A certified copy of such resolution should be transmitted to 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished is limited 
to 60 days from the date of this letter, unless the bank applies to the

Item No. 7 
11/30/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PACESETTER FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
Pacesetter Financial Corporation, Grand Haven, Michigan, has 
applied for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding company 
through acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares of the successor 
by consolidation to Security First Bank & Trust Co., Grand Haven, Michigan 
("Grand Haven Bank"), and 100 per cent of the voting shares of the successor 
by consolidation to Traverse City State Bank, Traverse City, Michigan 
("Traverse City Bank"). The banks into which Grand Haven Bank and Traverse 
City Bank are to be consolidated have no significance except as a means to 
facilitate the acquisition of all shares of Grand Haven and Traverse City 
banks. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the successor organizations 
is treated herein as the proposed acquisition of Grand Haven Bank and 
Traverse City Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
Â§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
none has been timely received. The Board has considered the application in 
light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant is a nonoperating corporation formed for the express 
Purpose of acquiring Grand Haven Bank which has aggregate deposits of $53.8 
Million and Traverse City Bank with total deposits of $72.4 million. (All 
banking data are as of June 30, 1972 except market data deposit figures 

. 3 4 7 0 
-2-
are shown as of December 31, 1971.) Consummation of this formation would 
represent only a nominal increase in concentration of banking resources in 
Michigan, and concentration in the local markets would not be affected. 
There is no significant existing competition between the Grand 
Haven and Traverse City Banks, the main offices of which are located 135 
miles apart. Nor does it appear likely that any substantial amount of 
future competition would develop between them. 
Grand Haven Bank is the fourth largest of six banks in its market 
area, the three largest of which hold total area deposits of $128, $90, 
and $74 million, respectively. Consummation of this proposal would have 
no significant adverse effect on the other market banks. Although Traverse 
City Bank is the largest bank in its market, there are two area banks of 
substantial eiÂ«e with 
aggregate deposits of $34 and $30 million each, 
and it does not appear that the proposed formation would have any significant 
adverse effect on the operations of these market banks. Competitive 
considerations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Applicant has no present operations, and its financial condition, 
Management, and future prospects are dependent on those same conditions 
as they exist in Grand Haven and Traverse City Banks. The financial con-
dition of Grand Haven Bank is considered to be generally satisfactory in 
view of Applicant's commitment to provide additional equity capital for 
the bank within the near future. The financial condition of Traverse City 
Bank is deemed to be generally satisfactory. Management of both banks is 

3471 
-2-
judged to be capable, and prospects for the group appear favorable. 
Banking factors are consistent with approval of the application. The 
banking needs of the communities appear to be satisfactorily served at 
the present time, and Applicant proposes no substantial changes in existing 
services. However, the proposed formation would result in increased 
administrative and managerial skills, broader loan bases, and greater 
capitalization, all of which would ultimately benefit the communities. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served are consistent with approval of the application. It is the 
Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the public interest and 
that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, 
unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority.

11/30/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
MID AMERICA BANCORPORATION, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Mid America Bancorporation, Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota, has 
applied for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 90 per cent or more of the 
voting shares of Hillcrest State Bank of St. Paul, St. Paul, Minnesota 
("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
Â§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
and the Board has considered the application and all comments received 
in light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls seven banks with aggregate deposits of 
approximately $69 million, representing 0.7 per cent of the total com-
mercial bank deposits in the State, and is the seventh largest banking 
organization in Minnesota. (All banking data are as of December 31, 1971, 
and reflect bank holding company formations and acquisitions approved by 
the Board through November 15, 1972.) Applicant's acquisition of Bank 
($12.5 million in deposits) would increase Applicant's share of deposits 
in Minnesota by 0.1 percentage point, without changing its ranking 
within the State. 
Bank is located adjacent to a local shopping center five miles 
northeast of the St. Paul central business district. The relevant market 

-2-
area is the Minneapolis-St. Paul banking market in which Applicant has six 
banking subsidiaries, the closest being located some nine miles to the 
west of Bank, in Roseville. There ia no substantial existing competition 
between Applicant's present banking subsidiaries and Bank; and, for 
several reasons, including the distances involved, the presence of banking 
alternatives in the intervening areas, and Minnesota's prohibition against 
branch banking, there is no substantial likelihood of future competition 
developing between those subsidiaries and Bank. For similar reasons, 
there is no significant possibility of substantial competition developing 
between Bank and Applicant's other banking subsidiary, which is located 
about 60 miles west of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. 
Additionally, consummation of this transaction might have a 
beneficial effect on competition in the Minneapolis-St. Paul banking 
market. Six other bank holding company groups hold, in the aggregate, 
nearly 81.9 per cent of market deposits, while Applicant controls only 
1.0 per cent of market deposits. Acquisition of Bank would increase 
Applicant's share of market deposits by 0.2 percentage points, would give 
it representation in an area of the Twin Cities in which it is presently 
not represented, and, thus, might enable it to provide more effective com-
petition for the larger banking organizations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
banking market. On the basis of the record before it, the Board condludes 
that consummation of the proposed acquisition would not adversely affect 
competition in any relevant area. 
Considerations relating to the financial and managerial resources 
and future prospects of Applicant and its subsidiary banks and Bank are 

3478 
-2-
regarded as satisfactory, in view of Applicant's commitment to provide 
additional capital funds to Bank and to two of its banking subsidiaries. 
Applicant can provide lending policy guidance that might strengthen the 
overall asset condition and management of Bank, and this consideration 
lends some weight for approval of the application. Convenience and needs 
considerations relating to the communities to be served are consistent 
with approval. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the 
proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and that the appli-
cation should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this 
Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis pursuant to delegated authority.

Dear Mr. Marks: 
Further reference is made to your letter of November 1, 
1972, in which you request, inter alia, that the Board extend, beyond 
November 15, 1972, the time within which to comment on the Board's 
review of grandfather privileges of 44 bank holding companies listed 
in the Board's Order of September 26, 1972. 
This is to advise you that the Board has denied your specific 
request for an extension of the comment period. However, it is the 
Board's practice to consider any comments received in time for con-
sideration before Board action even though the formal comment period 
has expired; and any relevant comments received by December 7, 1972, 
will be considered by the Board.

First National City Corporation 
399 Park Avenue 
New York, New York 10022 
Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of June 9, 1972, the Board of 
Governors grants consent, pursuant to the provisions of Sec-
tion 4(c) (13) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, 
and Section 225.4(f) of Regulation Y, for your Corporation, ("FNCC"), 
to purchase and hold all of the shares of Citicorp International. Bank 
Limited, ("CIBL"), London, England, at a cost of approximately 
$5,200,000, provided half of such shares are acquired within one 
year from the date of this letter. 
As a subsidiary of a bank holding company under Sec-
tion 4(c)(13), CIBL shall confine its activities to international or 
foreign banking and other international or foreign financial op-
erations. 
You have requested consent for CIBL to engage in the 
business of underwriting or dealing in securities. The Board's 
consent to such activities is conditioned upon your Corporation's 
obtaining the prior consent of the Board for the continued holding 
of shares of CIBL should CIBL acquire stock of individual issuers 
costing in excess of $500,000 or representing 25 per cent of the 
voting shares of any company, except in the case of underwriting 
operations covered by firm commitments from subunderwriters or other 
purchasers. With respect to trading in securities in which Cor-
porations are prohibited from investing by the provisions of the 
eighth paragraph of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, the 
Board's consent is further conditioned on the fact that CIBL will 
acquire such shares only as dealer or underwriter, maintain a size 
and turnover of inventory that is reasonable in relation to demand, 
and dispose of such shares within a reasonable time. 
In this connection, shares acquired as a dealer need not be 
reported under Section 225.4(f)(4) of Regulation Y. However, they 
are to be reported as a separate class, together with the date of 
acquisition on any Call Report of Condition or similar report requested 
bv the Boarc 0 

First National City Corporation 
-2-
Your application indicated that it is FNCC's view that 
loans by First National City Bank, ("FNCB"), to CIBL would be exempt 
from the requirements of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and 
that FNCC intends to submit a brief to that effect to the Board. 
It is the preliminary ruling of the Board that the restrictions of 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act would 
apply to loans by FNCB or other affiliated United States banks to 
CIBL and this consent is granted on the condition that, until a final 
ruling is made, credit extensions to CIBL by affiliated United State? 
banks will conform to the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Sec-
tion 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
The Board of Governors also grants consent for FNCC to 
purchase and hold indirectly all of the shares of a nominee company 
to be formed in England. This consent is granted on the condition 
that the nominee company shall restrict its activities to holding 
securities or properties for the custody of others. 
The foregoing consents are given on the condition that 
the investments will be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint 
Guidelines as they apply to First National City Bank and its affiliate

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of September 15, 1972, the 
Board of Governors grants consent for your Corporation, ("CMOBC"), 
to purchase and hold 50 per cent of the shares of United Chase 
Merchant Bank Limited, ("UCMB"), Singapore, at a cost of approxi-
mately $1,400,000, provided the shares are acquired within one 
year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of UCMB by CMOBC is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) That CMOBC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in UCMB if UCMB at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those per-
missible to a corporation in which a corporation 
organized under Section 25(a) of the Federal 
Reserve Act could, with the consent of the Board 
of Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if 
UCMB establishes any branch or agency or takes 
any action or undertakes any operation ir> Singapore 
or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the time 
would net be permissible to CMOBC; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, CMOBC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of UCMB as it may require from time 
to time; and 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by UCMB 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K 
in the same manner as if UCMB were a corporation

Subiect to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as they 
relate to restrictions set forth in Section 211.9(a), (b), and (c) 
of Regulation K. 
You have requested consent for UCMB to engage in the business 
of underwriting or dealing in securities. The Board has determined 
that such activities are usual in the business of banking in Singapore, 
The Board's consent to such activities is conditioned upon your 
Corporation's obtaining the prior consent of the Board for the con-
tinued holding of shares of UCMB should UCMB acquire stock of in-
dividual issuers costing in excess of $500,000 or representing 
2 5 per cent of the voting shares of any company, except in the case 
of underwriting operations covered by firm commitments from sub-
underwriters or other purchasers. With respect to trading in secu-
rities in which Corporations are prohibited from investing by the 
provisions of the eighth paragraph of Section 25(a) of the Federal 
Reserve Act, the Board's consent is further conditioned on the fact 
that UCMB will acquire such shares only as dealer or underwriter, 
maintain a sizc and turnover of inventory that is reasonable in 
relation to demand, and dispose of such shares within a reasonable 
time. 
In this connection, shares acquired as a dealer need not 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K, However, they 
are to be reported as a separate class, together with the date oL: 
acquisition, on any Call Report of Condition or similar report 
requested by the Board. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
of Association, and By-Laws of UCMB* 
The Board also grants consent for CMOBC to continue to hold 
the shares of UCMB after UCMB issues and has outstanding obligations 
with maturities in excess of one year in an amount not exceeding 
twenty times its registered and paid-in capital. 
The foregoing consent is given on the condition that the 
investment will be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines 
as they apply to The Chase Manhattan Bank, National Association arid 
its affiliates. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith
