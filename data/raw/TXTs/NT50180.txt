ffaudulent home improvement contracts. In particular, one article 
*?,> .V' •' 
indicated that such practices had been aided through the apparent 
failure of some banks to investigate thoroughly the firms with which 
they regularly did business, as required by regulations of the Federal 
fusing Administration. Chairman Fascell requested information regard-
n
g the practices and procedures that had been followed "to proscribe 
\ ' . S ' - . 
th 
e
 utilization of banking institutions in the operations of such 
Sc
hemes, and the manner in which such proscriptions are enforced as a 
Su
Pervisory matter." Similar inquiries had been addressed by Chairman 
Pa cell to the other bank supervisory agencies.

Governors Robertson and Maisel expressed the view that the 
re
Ply should be more positive, and the former suggested a number of 
cha 
n
ges toward that end, particularly to emphasize questions that bank 
I 
iners would be expected to raise. A change in the draft also was

new Regulation G, covering heretofore unregulated lenders) that the 
Board published for comment on October 20. 
I 
About 200 of the 500 or more responses to the invitation for 
comments requested that a "hearing" be held before the Board took 
ac
tion on the proposals; it was evident that many of those requests 
h a d
 been made at the suggestion of "money brokers." If the Board saw 
fit to allow parties to present their views personally, it appeared 
th 
a
t an oral presentation would be sufficient, as contrasted with a 
formal hearing before a hearing examiner. However, since the public 
Station for comments had specified written responses, it would seem 
a t
 if an opportunity for oral presentation was afforded, that fact 
sh 
0 u
ld be made known to the general public rather than only to those 
h a
d requested such an opportunity. 
t'i 
The memorandum mentioned, as arguments in favor of an oral 
p r e s 
station, that members of the Board might find it helpful and infor-
mative f 
to question industry representatives and that the opportunity 
Personal presentation of views might be desirable out of fairness 
Darn e s w h
o would be affected by the proposals. 
Arguments against an oral presentation were: 
(1) it would 
de 
a
ction on the proposals, not only because of the time required 
for t h 
oral presentation itself but also for filing of notices of 
4
 tut 
C e

 appear, preparation of statements, scheduling of appearances, 
t u d
y of material submitted; (2) the lapse of time would prolong 
s

.Vi^iSfv-* X' 
e
 present uncertainty in the market; and (3) the staff saw little 
V. .ft,• f \' 
indication that any very helpful or new comments or suggestions would 
r
esult. 
- * X*?"' > ( 
After introductory comments by Miss Hart, Governor Mitchell 
in
quired whether it might be sufficient to require that for the time 
e i
ng all comments be submitted in writing. Then, in the light of 
comments received, the Board could decide whether or not to permit 
' V 
lit .-
oral presentation. The written statements might serve to indicate the 
^
U a
lity of the oral views that would be forthcoming. 
' 
, ' 
Governor Maisel observed that additional delay would result 
ftnm -C 
following such a procedure and suggested that plans be made for 
oral Presentation. All who wished to appear might be allowed a certain 
*' '"'' ^Qtto f ** - • ~1m. i ' ' -

< . V-V'v' i
: v
 '•'• 
s
> and attendance by members of the Board could vary according to 
fis&ltfr' • 
time they could make available. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that if any opportunity 
Of 
n Personal appearance was afforded, it should be extended to all who 
Wanted to appear. He was in favor of limiting comments to written 
Mentations. He believed that oral presentations in a matter such 
thi 
s
 would result in a great deal of delay and that little if any-
^inji 
® could be said in person that could not be submitted in writing. 
•Ln the general discussion that followed the staff emphasized 
that 
a
n opportunity was to be given for oral presentation it would 

11/20/67 
-6-
be desirable to let that be known to the general public through a 
second announcement. It was also brought out that the number of 
' 
ft i . 
Persons who might seek to be heard, if actually offered the opportunity, 
could hardly be predicted at this time. In this connection, Governor 
Maisel made it clear that he had in mind that anyone who wanted to 
a
ppear would be expected to submit a written statement in advance. 
Governor Daane expressed doubt whether oral expressions would 
e
 fruitful. If review of the written comments should indicate that 
°
ra
l supplementation would be helpful, however, arrangements could 
t h e
n be made.

Governor Brimmer inquired whether oral presentation might serve 
t o
 indicate how much lending had actually been taking place that would 
S* 
a
ffected by the proposals. Miss Hart replied that, while only a 
jective answer could be given, it was her judgment that presenta-
ti °
ns
 to the Board would not be particularly helpful. The staff could 
;.'V'. v.-;- y

'. •. 
obtain 
more useful information through direct consultation with indus-
^
 re
presentatives. There had been many such conferences since the 
Pr
°Posals were published, and a number of them had been helpful and 
Pr
°<*uctive.

Governor Brimmer then inquired whether it might be useful to 
SUgg s c
 to persons located at some distance that any views they wished

^press in person might be presented at the offices of the nearest 
p

in some cases. However, it seemed probable that many of the persons 
who had asked to be heard desired the satisfaction of presenting their 
i ,"'»» A'r-
views to the Board directly. 
Governor Brimmer then stated that he would not favor granting 
\ 
0 r
al presentation before the Board, because he doubted whether that 
would be productive. 
Governor Maisel expressed misgivings that failure to allow 
* 
0 r a
l presentation might create an impression that the Board was not 
w
illing to listen to the views of the general public. It seemed to 
' klm v

he did not believe that that would require any great expenditure

Governor Sherrill stated that while he was in favor of hearing 
1 Peopip 
. 
wnen it would serve some purpose, he thought no purpose would 
Dp o 
o c r
ved in this case. He doubted whether oral presentations could 
be 0 r Sanized in such a way as to satisfy the parties and yet conserve 
^iine 
t , 
; 
h i s v i
e w , the difficulties outweighed the probable benefits. 
Chairman Martin commented that he was in favor of hearing 
Pe
°Ple wh 
whenever possible. He sympathized with Governor Maisel
f
s posi-
tion 
a
 matter of general posture. Yet in the present case it would 
be h i s 
Su
8gestion that the Board not provide an opportunity for oral 
P r e s
entati 
^ 
ions. It did not appear that the comments were likely to be 
u
larly useful to the Board, and problems might be created if 
•ttt 
time limits were prescribed.

In his memorandum, Governor Robertson mentioned possible alter-

the appointment of a successor to President Irons, who would retire

evident effective February 1, 1968, subject to approval by the Board

t to a large degree from the effects usually expected of a 
V y 
C o ^Petitive market. As the Supreme Court noted in United States 
v. j,h 
National Dank. 374, U.S. 321, 358 (1963): "In banking,

Significant, on the entire record X conclude that there is no substantial 
Co

to 
the extent that First American is regarded as an alternative source of

| To the extent that there may be greater acceptance by Mosinee

idents of services offered by Mosinee Commercial under Applicant
f
i 
» it is foreseeable that other banks which are now receiving 
a
 trom this area may be adversely affected by consummation of the 
bu
°lnes 
acquisition. It does not appear, however, that any other bank 
Pendent on business derived from the Mosinee area that its 
^ h s T * * chartering by State authorities of the River Valley State Bank 
presents the probability of still another alternative source 
r
 of J ^ services, and one that will be located closer to Mosinee than 
other banks. 

v i a
bili t y or competitive effectiveness is likely to be seriously 
aff
ected by the increase in competition which may result from Applicant's 
n t r

f l l i l f S 
' 
Summarizing the probable effect of Applicant's proposal on 
^ t i t i o n , the Board concludes that consummation of the proposed 
^isition would not result in a monopoly nor be in furtherance of any 
^ination, conspiracy or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
a t l y a r
e a . Adverse effects on competition would result from the 
ft„i 
^ncem 
"lent of the already dominant position of First American in Marathon

^ount 
and from the elimination of present competition between First

and Mosinee Commercial. These effects, however, are partially 
t8
et K 
°y the fact that the acquisition will have little or no effect 
in ^ 
a u s a u
 area, which is the source of First American's strength 
and d o

Polic-ies and practices of Mosinee Commercial with the more aggressive

The fact that differences exist in the deposit and loan

 itself, of the ineffectiveness of competition between them than is 
Un

of Mosinee Commercial's management, its interests and those 
of t { i e
