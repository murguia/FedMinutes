In connection with Item No. 2, it was understood that approval 
w a s contingent upon a finding by the staff that the investment would 
be made within the ceiling guidelines of the foreign credit restraint 
Program, which finding was subsequently made. 
i* $ • * i The application for two branches (also Item No. 2) reflected 
1.L 
proposed acquisition of assets and assumption of deposit liabili-
ties of Banco Nacional, S.A., Santiago, Dominican Republic, by Bank of 
America National Trust and Savings Association. 
In that connection, 
Ur*animous approval was given to the transmittal of a competitive factor 
report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in which the con-
clusion was stated that consummation of the proposal would provide 
iiic 
r*" ^' 
creased competition to other U.S. banks operating in the inter-
: ' V is ; 
national field. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
C t, ..< 
factors involved in the proposed consolidation of The First National 
Bank of Williamsport, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and The Danville 
tional Bank, Danville, Pennsylvania, was approved unanimously for 
ansmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion read 
a s follows: 
Mnk 
There is virtually no competition to be eliminated 
y the consolidation of The First National Bank of Williams-
Port, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and The Danville National 
Danville, Pennsylvania. However, there is some poten-
al for competition between the two banks, and the overall 
competitive effect would be slightly adverse.

There had been distributed a draft of report to the Comptroller 
tne Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The Merchants and Planters National Bank of Gaffney, Gaffney, 
South Carolina, into The Citizens and Southern National Bank of South 
Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina. 
After discussion during which it was agreed that the overall 
effect on competition of the proposed merger should be described as 
adverse" rather than "slightly adverse," the report was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller in a form in which the 
conclusion read as follows: 
There is little existing competition between The 
Citizens and Southern National Bank of South Carolina, 
Charleston, and The Merchants and Planters National Bank 
of Gaffney. However, potential competition would be 
eliminated, and concentration of banking resources would 
be increased in the State's second largest bank which now 
holds about 12 per cent of the total deposits held by South 
Carolina banks. The overall competitive effect would be 
adverse. 
At the Board meeting on August 12, 1968, in connection with 
discussion of a draft of report to the Comptroller of the Currency on 
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of Sequoia 
National Bank of San Mateo County, Redwood City, California, into The 
of California, National Association, San Francisco, California, 
questio 
xons were raised as to the relevant market area, which had been 
tated i n 
draft report to be the San Francisco-Oakland Standard 
Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Under date of August 14, 1968, there was distributed a revised 
draft of report reflecting the view of the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation that the competitive impact of the proposal would be slightly 
adverse and would be felt primarily in Redwood City. The Banking Mar-
kets Section, in a separate memorandum, expressed the view that at a 
Minimum the relevant market would be approximated by San Mateo County, 
a°d that the competitive effect of the proposed merger would be border-
line between slightly adverse and adverse. 
After discussion, the transmittal of the report to the Comp-
troller was approved unanimously with the conclusion reading as follows, 
although Governor Robertson expressed a leaning toward use of the term 
"adverse": 
Competition existing between The Bank of California, 
National Association, San Francisco, and Sequoia National 
Bank of San Mateo County, Redwood City, is not signifi-
cant, although there is potential for increased competi-
tion between them in view of the State's branch banking 
statutes. The overall competitive effect of the merger 
would be slightly adverse. 
Regulatory and supervisory problems (Item No. 4). At its 
eeting on June 17, 1968, the Conference of Presidents authorized its 
°nunittee on Bank Supervision and Legislation to approach the Board to 
de term * 
""J-ne the feasibility of a joint study of the current problems of 
suiatory 
and supervisory relationships with member banks. In a 
letter dated June 27, 1968, President Coldwell, Chairman of the Con-
r e n c e Cowmittee, requested that the Board give consideration to the 

318,2. 
8/19/68 
-6-
project. He stated that although the Presidents recognized that 
statutory authority for examination and regulation by the Federal 
Reserve rested principally with the Board, they felt that the Reserve 
Banks could be helpful in a review of this area, particularly since 
t h e Banks functioned as agents of the Board in making field investiga-
tions . 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated August 15, 
1968, f r o m j-hg office of. the Secretary recommending that the Board 
approve the establishment of a joint Board-Reserve Bank staff task 
for the purpose of exploring the problems and considering possi-
ble means of removing or alleviating them. The memorandum suggested 
t h a t membership on the task force consist of eight senior officers, 
£ 
U r to be selected by the Presidents' Conference from the Reserve 
anks,fin(i four by the Board from its staff. The memorandum also sug-
gested t-Hat-
n a t participation in the study by outside academic, banking, 
° r b a n k supervisory liaison groups might be helpful. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that he would not be inclined to 
SuPP0rt Mi 
cne proposed study. In times of budgetary restraint and heavy 
j 
n s upon the Board's staff, including the Banking Markets Section, 
seemed to him that such a project should be assigned a rather low 
Priority. 
Governor Daane thought the proposal was worthy of considera-
tion on t-K 
c ne ground that the System's posture in this area needed to 

1<i Q 3 
8/19/68 
-7-
reexamined. While he would assign generally a higher priority to 
monetary policy matters than regulatory matters, he felt there was a 
distinct need for a study of the type proposed. 
In making it, he 
would take advantage of resources available through the Reserve Banks. 
Governor Sherrill said that he, too, would consider the study 
worth while, although he would not want to foreclose the Board's pro-
ceeding even faster than the task force would presumably be able to 
move in looking at the problems that were currently most pressing. 
Governor Maisel remarked that there appeared to be two areas 
concern: one had to do with examination standards, the other had 
to do with general philosophy relating to decisions on bank merger and 
bank holding company cases. He did not believe that the proposed study 
Would be helpful in the latter area, but it was conceivable that a 
c°ntribution could be made in the other. 
After further discussion, Governor Robertson suggested that the 
Committee on Bank Supervision and Legislation be asked to delineate 
m° r e sharply the specific issues it believed deserving of study, that 
Messrs. Hackley and Leavitt meet with the Committee at a mutually agree-
N L I e time for this purpose, and that the subject then be brought back 
t o the Board for further consideration.

There was agreement with Governor Robertson's suggestion; a 
°Py of the letter subsequently sent to President Coldwell is attached

Director vacancy at Cleveland. There had been distributed a 
memorandum from Mr. Morgan dated August 14, 1968, presenting a list of 
persons who might be considered for appointment as a Class C director 
°f the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, since Mr. Logan Johnston, 
Deputy Chairman, would be ineligible for reappointment as a director 
uPon expiration of his second term at the end of this year. 
Concern was expressed by several Board members about the appar-
ent tendency on the part-of Reserve Banks to confine the names put 
forward for consideration to representatives of large business organi-
sations, and it was suggested that in the present instance the Cleveland 
Bank be requested to explore the possibility of submitting the names of 
Persons from other fields, such as small business or labor. It was 
o suggested that an expression of desire for greater diversity of 
interests among Board-appointed directors might be made known to the 
Re 
serve Banks generally as a guide in proposing candidates to fill 
Vacancies in the future. 
In the ensuing discussion there was general agreement in prin-
ciple with the desirability of a broad diversity of interests. However, 
p 
Vernors Daane and Sherrill noted that at least two of the men pro-
Posed i n t^e distributed memorandum were of outstanding caliber and 
should be able to make a definite contribution to the System. There-
> while they would not object to requesting additional names, they 
0uld not want to rule out at this juncture the ultimate selection of 

3185 
8/19/68 
-9-
one of the candidates already proposed. In addition, they were reluc-
tant to establish any general policy guidelines except at a time when 
all members of the Board could be present. 
Following further discussion it was understood that the Cleve-
land Bank would be asked to suggest additional names for consideration 
along with those already submitted. 
Application of Valley Bancorporation (Items 5-8). At the Board 
meeting on July 31, 1968-, the application of Valley Bancorporation, 
Appleton, Wisconsin, to acquire 80 per cent or more of the voting shares 
°f Seymour State Bank, Seymour, Wisconsin, was approved subject to the 
receipt of a satisfactory expression of intent on the part of the appli-
cant with respect to the retirement of its outstanding debt. Subse-
quently, i n a letter dated August 6, 1968, Valley Bancorporation gave 
assurance of its intent to sell additional stock in sufficient amount 
0 assure retirement of its outstanding debt within approximately six 
months. 
There had now been distributed drafts of an order and statement 
reflecting the Board's approval of the application. The statement would 
°ntain reference to Valley Bancorporation's intent with respect to 
d e bt retirement. 
During discussion Governor Maisel expressed his intent to issue 
dissenting statement. Governor Robertson indicated that he also had 
nsidered the preparation of a dissenting statement but had decided 

3188 
8/19/68 
-10-
against it in view of the fact that his vote to deny the application 
had been based largely on factors related to the condition of the 
holding company system. 
The issuance of the order and statement, at such time as 
Governor Maisel's dissenting statement was available, was then autho-
£ize<l. Copies of the documents, as issued, are attached as Items 5 
A copy of Governor Maisel's dissenting statement is attached 
a s Item No. 7. A copy of the letter sent to the applicant is attached 
a s Item No. 8. 
Request from Department of Justice. Mr. O'Connell recalled 
At [, I;; . 
j 
tllat in a recent report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the com-
petitive factors involved in the proposed merger of Bank of Las Vegas, 
s Vegas, Nevada, and Valley Bank of Nevada, Reno, Nevada, into Nevada 
National Bank of Commerce, Reno, Nevada, the Board had stated that the 
effect of the proposal on competition would be substantially 
ci dv 
r s e. The Department of Justice was considering instituting legal 
ac jj^Q 
n against the proposed merger and, in an effort to determine the 
Va l -i j J 
ty of certain assertions, had requested access to examination

O'Connell indicated that both the Legal Division and the 
n of Supervision and Regulation recommended that the Board

l e S S e n COmPetition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other 
banner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that the

Seventh in size among banking organizations and seventh in size among 
b a n k holdi^ 
companies operating in the State, as measured by control of

Applicant's six subsidiary banks operate eleven banking offices, 
fll 1 
r 
which are located within a 30-raile radius of Appleton, Wisconsin, 
*ocation of the home office of Applicant's largest subsidiary bank, 
appleton State Bank ($47 million deposits). 
Bank is located in the City of Seymour (population 2,400) about 
22 
miles northeast of Appleton and 15 miles west of Green Bay, the nearest 
largo pjj.

its primary service area" includes Seymour and a small 
porM 
011 of the surrounding agricultural area. The only other bank located 
i n Seymour or within the primary service area is First National Bank of 
p 
0 U r3 with deposits of $9.2 million-over 60 per cent of the total 
^ePosit<s • 
in Bank's service area. Applicant's closest subsidiary bank, 
o f Black Creek ($2.8 million deposits), is located about eight miles 
8°uthwe<?h 
c 
ot Seymour; the nearest office of Applicant's other subsidiaries 
is i^ miles from Seymour. 
There is no significant present competition between Bank and 
any 0£ » 
pplicant's subsidiary banks. Bank derives about one per cent of 
it8 <je 
P°sits and less than three per cent of its loans from the area 
served b y Bank of Black Creek, while the latter derives only one per cent 
its i 
°ans and deposits from Bank's service area. It appears, however, 
that the 
City of Seymour serves as a minor trade center for smaller sur-
n8 towns, including Black Creek, and that the absence of significant 
C0ll*petiti 
°n between the banks at present results, at least in part, from 
i 
1110 are 
ndividu i 
m w h i c h 
derives over 75 per cent of its deposits of 
Q i s> Partnerships, and corporations ("IPC deposits"). 

o o 
-2-
a lack of aggressiveness on the part of Bank under its present management. 
s o pointing to this conclusion is the fact that Bank's larger and more 
a8gressive competitor in Seymour is a more active competitor in the 
Bl 
Creek area. Therefore, although consummation of Applicant's pro-
POsal w°uld not eliminate significant existing competition between Bank 
..'V 
' ' 
»•• 
arid an 
ttny of Applicant's present subsidiaries, it would eliminate the 
Nihility of increased future competition between Bank and Bank of 
Black r r o , 
^reeu, which could occur were Bank to adopt a more aggressive 
c°mpetltive posture. 
Another somev/hat adverse consideration with respect to the 
Proposal 
a A is its effect in expanding Applicant's control over banking 
of£ic 
ln the area surrounding Appleton. Applicant presently controls 
0« 
-
cne six banking offices located within 20 miles to the north and 
vest of A 
Appleton; consummation of the present proposal would represent an 
eastv7ard extension of this office concentration. The significance of 
i s consiH 
sl-aeration, however, is considerably lessened by the fact that 
t h e normal fi 
ciow of commerce from Seymour is eastward toward Green Bay 
tat*er thn 
southwest toward Appleton, while Appleton residents, who 
h a v e as ait 
iternatives larger banks both within Appleton and immediately 
t o the 
s°uth, are unlikely to look toward Seymour for banking services. 
h e aforementioned adverse competitive implications of the 
Pr°Posal a r e largely offset by the significant increase in competition 
^tch 
c°nsummation of the proposal foreseeably would offer in the Seymour 
a r e a* Banl 
under conservative management, has been largely overshadowed 

-2-
^ its more aggressive and larger competitor in that area; under 
APPUcant's ownership, local competition for business originating in the 
Seymour area would be increased. 
The 
proposed transaction would not result in a monopoly or be 
ltl furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize 
business of banking in any relevant area. Further, although the 
Pr°posal has some anticompetitive as well as pro-competitive implications, 
d o e s n o t appear that the net effect of consummation of the proposal 
Would K 
o e to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, 
restrain trade in any section of the country,

• 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
The fi-
nancial condition of Applicant's present subsidiaries is regarded 
reasonably satisfactory. In its consideration of this application, 
tlie BoarH 
was concerned with Applicant's use of debt financing to effect 
*eent bank acquisition, a large portion of which debt is still out-
a 
Applicant 
has stated that incurrence of the debt was necessi-
tated b 
y market conditions which prevented its issuance of additional 
stock as a means of financing the earlier acquisition. Recognizing the 
^ed f 
early retirement of its existing acquisition debt, Applicant has 
8lven a fi 
t l rm commitment for sale of additional stock in sufficient amount 
to 
S U t e retireraent of its outstanding debt within approximately six months. 
B a s e d on th 
"is assurance, the Board concludes that Applicant's financial 
° n is also reasonably satisfactory. llanaGement of Applicant and 
l t s 8ubsid< 
banks is regarded as satisfactory and the prospects of the 
System aPP*ar favorable. 

Bank is in satisfactory financial condition and its present 
con-
managemenf ^ 
is capable, although, as earlier noted, somewhat overly 
8ervative 
tii 
. bilce many small banks, however, Bank has experienced difficulty 
in attr 
acting and retaining middle management, with the result that it is 
0 u t qualified successors for its two principal officers, both of when 
Iready well past the usual retirement age. Concern over this manaSe-
"terit succ 
cession problem is indicated by Applicant as a motivating factor 
Aspect to Bank's interest in the proposed affiliation, and it appears 
hat such - f f t n 
filiation would provide a solution to that problem. Assuming 
actory provision for successor management, Bank's prospects are 
frtfded as 
s favorable, and would be improved by the adoption of more 
88resslve l p 
policies, as contemplated by Applicant. 
Considerations under this factor are favorable to approval of

Item No. 7 
O / "I Q / £ Q 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR MAISEL 
I do not agree with the conclusion of the majority that the 
anticompetitive effects of Applicant's proposal are either offset by 
°ther competitive considerations or outweighed by considerations under 
the K 
ranking or "convenience and needs" factors. 
Applicant's subsidiaries are concentrated in Appleton, IJis-
c°nsin, a city in south-central Outagamie County. Of the six sub-
i d i a rV banks and 12 banking offices which it controls, four banks and 
ci8ht offices are located within Outagamie County. It controls three 
seven banking offices in the immediate Appleton area, and five of the 
banking offices within a 20 mile radius to the west and north of 
APpl< 
Nati< 
A n 
1 °ton. Another and slightly larger bank holding company, First 
0r*al Corporation, also controls three banking offices in Appleton 
the only other banking office in the area to the x;est and north. 
An 
icant controls eight of the 21 banking offices (38 per cent) and 30 
P r cent of the deposits within Outagamie County. First National Cor-
Poratir» 
controls four offices and about 39 per cent of county deposits. 
n C O n s ummation of the present proposal, the two dominant banking organi-
a t i° a s 
control 13 of 21 offices in the county and hold approxi-
matelv 70 
c Per cent of county deposits. Applicant will account for about 
43 
P Q Y 
cent of such offices and 33 per cent of such deposits. 
' V V . -
In referring to county concentration, I do not intend to imply 
tbat S U r h area constitutes a single banking market, or that banks located 
fie^r (-u 
e Perimeter of the county offer no alternative to customers re-
® idi 
n8 therein. Banks to the south and east of Appleton constitute alter-
atives f 
tor residents of that city and banks in Green Bay appear to offer 

3 2 3 6 
-2-
S° m e alternative to Seymour residents situated in the northeast corner 
° f t h e county. The extent of county concentration, however, does illu-
strate the substantial degree to which Applicant has succeeded in in-
sulating its Appleton subsidiaries from competition over a wide area to the 
W 6 S t a n d north, and also illustrates that residents of those surrounding 
rural areas are without practical local alternatives to the dominant organi-
ations in Appleton. The present proposal continues this pattern. Appli-
C a n t s subsidiary, Bank of Black Creek, presently maintains the only banking 
f f i ce i n the rural community of Black Creek. The closest office to the 
West of t>i 
r B l ack Creek is a branch of Applicant's largest subsidiary. No 
nking offices are located between Black Creek and Appleton, 15 miles to 
south. The only bank located proximately to the north is a small 
($•1,5 million deposit) bank in Nichols, about six miles distant. The only 
C a l banks which might be regarded as significant practical alternative 
s°urceq 
e u 
of banking services for residents of the area, therefore,.are the 
tvo banl 
8 l n Seymour, about eight miles northwest. The present proposal 
eliminate one of those alternatives. 
The majority does not deny that Bank presently constitutes an 
alternati v e source of banking services to customers of Applicant's Black 
Creek s h 
ubsidiary. On the contrary, it finds that Bank presently consti-
tutes a n alternative which, with more aggressive management, would be even 
m 
eaningfui. It is surprising, therefore, that the fact that Bank's 
Present m management is now past retirement age should be considered by the 
maJoritv 
y as offsetting, or even outweighing, the elimination of competition 
*htch now 
exists. Rather, in my view, that circumstance provides a basis 
hope t-h 
c n a t , if Applicant's proposal were not consummated, competition 

O/U U < 
-2-
between Bank and Applicant's subsidiary would be intensified in the 
• 
future. The early replacement of Bank's present management is inevi-
table, and the transfer of Bank to new owners is probable, regardless of 
Aether the Board approves the present application. 
Even aside from the fact that consummation of Applicant's pro-
posal is unnecessary to correct any competitive deficiencies which Bank 
Presently has, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that competitive 
Justification f o r the proposal is provided by its effect of strengthening 
ank's competitive position vis-a-vis its larger Seymour competitor. Com-
petition is not strengthened by the elimination of an unaggressive source 
service unless another alternative is provided in its place. Residents 
the Seymour area presently have three reasonably convenient banking 
ernatives - the two banks in Seymour and Applicant's subsidiary at 
^ack Creek. The proposed acquisition does not replace an unaggressive 
alt 
ernative with an aggressive one; it simply eliminates the unaggressive 
alt-
^native, reducing the alternatives to two. The fact that Applicant 
vtii * 
increase its subsidiary concentration in the area may, it is true, 
Provide additional convenience to those residents of the area who seek 
the 
services which it x/ill provide at Bank's location as well as in Black 
Creek 
» 
_ 
But a reduction by one-third in the local alternative sources of 
credit a 
•• is much too high a price to pay for that convenience. 
This, of course, does not deny to Applicant the right to expand 
•e 
h er. Assuming the accomplishment of Applicant's program for improving 
its CaPital position, there would be no question of its ability to assist

ll4^1 or unaggressive institutions in many areas of Wisconsin in a manner 
"hich could stimulate competition. The substantial concentration of 
anking facilities and resources in the area surrounding Appleton, however, 
dictates the conclusion what expansion of Applicant through an' acquisi-
tion which would extend that concentration and which would eliminate present 
Potential competition with one of its subsidiaries would have signifi-
anticompetitive effects. Applicant has failed to demonstrate any 
kenefiCiai effects of its "broposal sufficient to offset those anticompeti-
e effects, and accordingly has failed to sustain the burden, imposed 
it by the Act, of establishing that approval of its application would 
S mxt

the public interest. I would deny the application.

The Acting Director of the Division of Supervision and

stablished within one year from the date of this letter. 
In considering this application, it has been determined 
your bank's management is satisfactory, that the proposed

, ^stablishment of the branch will not tend to create an 
esirable competitive situation. 
It is understood that plans are being formulated to sell
