Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of January 20, 1967, the 
Board of Governors grants consent for your Corporation to purchase 
and hold 15,000 additional shares, par value Pesetas 1,000 each, 
of Banco Europeo de Negocios ("Eurobanco"), Madrid, Spain, at a 
cost of approximately US$375,000, such shares to be purchased from 
time to time between the date of this letter and September 30, 
1969. In this connection, the Board also approves the purchase 
and holding of shares of Eurobanco in excess of 10 per cent of 
your Corporation's capital and surplus. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding 
that the investment now being approved, combined with other foreign 
loans and investments of your Corporation, The First National Bank 
of Boston, and Bank of Boston International, will not cause the 
total of such loans and investments to exceed the guidelines estab-
lished under the voluntary foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect and that due consideration is being given to the priorities 
contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Karl E. Bakke

Mr. George H. Ellis, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 
Boston, Massachusetts. 02106 
Dear Mr. Ellis: 
Recent amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act have in-
creased the minimum hourly wage to $1.40 effective February 1, 1967. 
The Board feels that it would be inappropriate for a Federal 
Reserve Bank to have an employees' salary structure containing a grade 
limit below this minimum of $2,912 per year, irrespective of whether 
actual salaries paid by the Bank are in excess of that level. Accord-
ingly, you are requested to give consideration to raising the lower 
limits of Grades 1 and 2 in the employees' structure to $2,912, at 
least, effective February 1 without raising the maximums of these 
ranges. The Board is prepared to approve such adjustments if recom-
mended by your Board of Directors. 
The Board is aware that in the grades affected, this will 
temporarily depart from the accepted concept of a uniform 35 per cent 
spread between the minimum and maximum of the grade. However, it is 
believed that adjusting the minimum of the ranges only will tend to 
insulate the effect of the increase in the Federal minimum wage on the 
balance of the structure. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman
