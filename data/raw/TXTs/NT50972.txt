F & M Operating Company. 
In a memorandum dated September 2 0 , 
1972, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval 
of the application of F & M Operating Company, Abilene, T e x a s , to 
acquire shares of the successor 
by merger to First National Bank of 
Abilene. 
By acquiring the b a n k , the applicant would acquire control 
of an additional 3.9 per cent of the shares of Bank of Commerce, also 
of Abilene, owned by the bank's employee profit-sharing trust. 
The 
Banking Markets Section and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas also 
recommended approval. 
During today's discussion several questions were raised about 
First National Bank of Abilene's practice of making loans at preferential 
rates to officers and directors of correspondent banks. 
Action was deferred with the understanding that the staff would 
provide additional information for the Board's consideration. 
Pending legislation. 
In a memorandum dated October 1 1 , 1972, 
Messrs. Cardon and Frederic Solomon discussed pending legislation that 
would provide for the regulation of securities depositories, clearing 
agencies, and transfer agents. 
It was noted that the Senate version of 
the b i l l , S . 3 8 7 6 , was preferable to the House version, H . R . 16946. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft letter to Chairman Williams of 
the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs reflecting the Board's preference for the 
Senate bill.

The Board of Governors approves the proposal by the Federal 
Jte-PGtve Bank of Mew Y o r k to establish an RCPC in a leased facility 
i r i
 C r a n f o r d , New J e r s e y . 
Start-up costs of $830,000 and first year 
°Pe> acing expenses at the Cranford facility of $3,820,000 are also 
approved, along w i t h a temporary increase of 214 positions in the 
P ^ s e a t employment ceiling. 
It is understood that certain savings w i l l accrue with the 
ementation of the new RCPC due to elimination of the present sub-
to the Bergen County Clearing Bureau as w e l l as volume reductions 
and changes in deposit practices at the Federal Reserve Bank of Now 
. 
Specifically, it is understood that the need for 72 positions 
•'-
u
 New York w i l l be eliminated with the initial redirection of volume 
t o
 the RCPC. 
The temporary ceiling of 214 positions w i l l v.hen be 
E d u c e d b y 72 positions after a period of adjustment not to exceed 
M o n t h s . 
It is further understood that approximately 50 additional 
Positions w i l l be eliminated if the total potential reduction in 
Processing load is realized. 
If the total effect at New York is as a n t i c i p a t e d , the Board 
Understands that potential savings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Now 
-ork w i l l approach $1,500,000 per y e a r . 
The Board understands that 
taoso. savings are greater than originally projected in the p r o p o s a l . 
that they are contingent upon events not totally controlled by the 
* Scleral Reserve Bank of New Y o r k . 
Ac recommended b y our security consultant, the Board requests 
that the computer rooms at the new facility be provided with controlled 
Q c
e e s s doors to increase security in those a r e a s .

Dear M r . White: 
The Board has considered your request of 
September 14, 1972, that it adopt a rule to become part of 
Regulation Z which would prevent issuers of credit cards 
from cancelling them wholly or partly because of litigation 
brought by a cardholder under § 130 of the Truth iri Lending 
A c t , 
In the -judgment of the Board, its authority under the 
Act does not extend to the regulation of trade practices of 
creditors, other than to the extent such practices are in-
consistent with the disclosure, rescission and advertising 
provisions of the A c t , and a rule such as you request would 
not be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes 
of the A c t , prevent circumvention or evasion of it, or 
xeeilitate compliance with its provisions. 
Accordingly, 
the Board has respectfully declined your request. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith 
Tynan Smith 
Secretary of the Board

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
VIRGINIA NATIONAL BANKSHARES, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Virginia National Bankshares, Inc., Norfolk, Virginia, 
a
 bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding 
Company Act, has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire the successor by merger 
to Jefferson National Bank, Lynchburg, Virginia ("Bank"). The bank 
into which Bank is to be merged has no significance except as a means 
t o
 facilitate the acquisition of voting shares of Bank. 
Accordingly, 
^ e proposed acquisition is treated herein as a proposed acquisition 
the shares of Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and 
v
iews has expired, and the Board has considered the application and 
a
U comments received in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls one bank with deposits of 
approximately $1 billion, representing about 11 per cent of deposits 
1/ 
commercial banks in Virginia. 
Consummation of the proposal herein 
*°uld increase Applicant's share of deposits by only 0.1 percentage 
Point and would not result in a significant increase in the concentra-
tion of banking resources in Virginia. 
V All banking data are as of December 31, 1971.

Bank (deposits of about $7.6 million) opened for business 
August 24, 1970. It is estimated that as of December 31, 1971, 
had approximately 2,9 per cent of deposits in the Lynchburg 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area ("SMSA") and ranked sixth in 
size among seven banks in that area. Applicant's closest office to 
B a
nk is located seme 38 miles away, and due to this factor and 
s branching laws there is no significant existing competition 
between Applicant and Bank. Moreover, there does not appear to be a 
r e
asonable probability of future competition developing between 
Applicant and Bank since the Lynchburg SMSA has a lower population per 
banking office ratio than the Statewide average and does not appear 
a t
tractive for de novo entry. Additionally, Applicant's acquisition 
Bank could prove to be pro-competitive by enabling Bank to compete 
m
°re effectively with the larger banks in the area, four of which are 
affiliated 
with large bank holding companies. The Board concludes 
that competitive considerations are consistent with approval of the 
a
P P U c a t i o n . 
Applicant became a bank holding company on July 10, 1972, and 
^ u s has little operating history. However, the one bank it controls, 
V l r
8 i n i a National Bank ("Virginia National"), Norfolk, Virginia, is 
largest bank in Virginia and has an impressive operating history 
3 0
 that the future prospects of Applicant, which for the time being 
(le
Pend mainly on its ownership of Virginia National, appear favorable, 
^nk's financial and managerial resources and future prospects appear

S a
tisfactory, particularly in light of Applicant's proposal to provide 
a
dditional management depth and capital to Bank. Thus, banking con-
siderations lend weight for approval of the application. 
Considerations 
Elating to the convenience and needs of the community are consistent 
approval of the application. It is the Board's judgment that the 
Proposed transaction is in the public interest and that the application 
s h
ould be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
t h
is Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
t h
is Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board,

l r Mr a Ch ai rman: 
I am w r i t i n g in regard, to S, 3876 arid H . R . 16945, providing for 
the regulation of securities d e p o s i t o r i e s , clearing agencies, and 
transfer a g e n t s . 
The Board of Governors believes that with respcet 
to b u n k s , b a n k h o l d i n g c o m p a n i e s , and nonbank subsidiaries of b a n k 
holding companies the provisions of S. 3876 are preferable to those 
of II.RT 16946. 
In contrast with the Senate b i l l , the Rouse bill makes no provision 
for supervision b y the Board of Governors of bank holding companies 
and their nonbank subsidiaries. 
In conformity with the regulatory 
structure established by the Congress, the Board should be provided 
with e n f o r c e m e n t authority over securities transaction processing 
firms that are bank holding companies or nonbank subsidiaries of 
such companies, as provided in section 4 of S. 3876. 
Botli bills recognize that: for banks that ere subject to the new 
legislation, enforcement should be in the hands of the appropriate 
banking a g e n c y . 
However, the House bill departs from this principle 
in several instances. 
Thus, it would authorize SEC to examine banks 
ur-deiL some circumstances--a provision that is unnecessary and could 
rafiult in duplication of effort and confusion of responsibility, 
Another example relates to r e g i s t r a t i o n . 
Where a b a n k acts as trans-
fer i.fvei!(:; the Senate bill provides for registration with the appro-
p;: is t e banking agency but: the House bill requires registration with 
S c O . 
A third example relates to the appointment of a trustee in 
& clearing agency is suspended or its registration revoked; 
the Senate bill provides for such action to be taken by the appro-
priate regulatory agency, whereas the House bill places that 
• ^ p o s s i b i l i t y in S E C . 

Tht; Honorable Harrison A . W i l l i a m s , Jr. 
-2-
Horeovcr, Che Senate bill includes more effective provisions for 
consultation among the appropriate regulatory agencies than the 
House b i l l . 
For example, under S. 3876, any agency contemplating 
issuance or adoption of any rule or regulation would be required 
to consult with and request the views of the other agencies at 
least fifteen days in advance. 
In. contrast:, H.R. 16496 provides 
fiimply that "the*appropriate regulatory agencies shall consult and 
cooperate with each other, as may be appropriate, toward the end 
that their mutual regulatory needs arid responsibilities be fulfilled 
to the maximum extent practicable." 
I n sum, w e believe that in a number of respects the Senate bill m o r e 
effectively conforms to the traditional patterns of bank supervision 
established by- Congress to assure sound banking practices. 
Sincerely y o u r s , 
A r t h u r F . Burns
