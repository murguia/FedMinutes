Municipal warrants. On November 13, 1968, the Board authorized 
the issuance of an interpretation listing various Federal agency 
issues now eligible as collateral for advances to member banks under 
the eighth paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act as 
recently amended. Paragraph (d) of the interpretation stated that 
municipal warrants eligible for purchase under Regulation E, Purchase 
of Warrants, were also now eligible as collateral for advances. 
In a memorandum of December 13, 1968, the Legal Division 
advised that upon further consideration in the light of discussions 
with Federal Reserve Bank discount officers and a letter received 
from the New York Reserve Bank, it seemed doubtful that the stringent 
requirements of Regulation E were either necessary or practicable in 
determining the eligibility of warrants as collateral for advances. 
Accordingly, it was recommended that paragraph (d) of the Board's 
recent interpretation be amended as follows: 
(d) Also eligible for purchase under section 14(b) 
are "bills, notes, revenue bonds, and warrants with a 
maturity from date of purchase of not exceeding six 
months, issued in anticipation of the collection of 
taxes or in anticipation of the receipt of assured 
revenues by any State, county, district, political 
subdivision, or municipality in the continental United

districts." Te-fehe-exfeenfe-suek-ebligafeiens-wetild-be

(Such obligations 
payable from specifically designated tax or other assured 
revenues to be collected before the obligation matures 
are now eligible as collateral for advances.) 
After discussion, issuance of the amended interpretation 
•was authorized, assuming that a check with the Reserve Bank discount 
officers disclosed no reason to bring the matter back to the Board. 
(Note: Following a check with the Reserve Banks, the revision of 
paragraph (d) was published.) 
Equal employment opportunity. At its meeting on December 16, 
1968, the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks had 
approved a policy position on equal employment opportunity within 
the Federal Reserve System and had also approved a ten-point program 
of action aimed at further progress in that area. Copies of the 
material evidencing the discussion of the subject by the Presidents 
had been made available to the Board. 
It was the unanimous view that the Presidents should be 
informed that the Board concurred in the policy position adopted by 
the Presidents and strongly supported the measures aimed at effectuating 
the policy position. There was agreement with suggestions that the 
letter sent to the Presidents should (1) reflect the Board's 

4409 
12 > ' • 
12/18/68 
-6-
understanding that the key emphasis in this program would be on 
reaching the hard-core unemployed; (2) recognize that such efforts 
might entail reasonable additional costs to the Reserve Banks and 
make clear that such expenditures, within the safeguards contained in 
the Conference program, were excepted from the limiting provisions 
of previous S-letters regarding the use of Reserve Bank funds for 
community projects; and (3) indicate that the Board would appreciate 
receiving periodic progress reports. 
With respect to the tenth point in the action program, 
calling for the designation of a senior officer at each Reserve Bank 
to report to the President or First Vice President on the equal 
employment opportunity program, it was agreed that the letter sent 
to the Presidents should strongly suggest, although not specify, 
that the designated officer be outside the regular personnel function. 
Additionally, it was suggested that copies of the letter to 
the Presidents be sent to the Chairmen of the respective Reserve Banks. 
A copy of the letter subsequently sent to the Reserve Bank 
Presidents is attached as Item No. 10. 
Civil rights. In a letter to the Federal Reserve Banks 
dated June 7, 1965 (S-1959), the Board concurred in the conclusion 
of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks that 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not applicable to the 
Reserve Banks but that the Banks were subject to Title VII of the Act 

' 1410 
12/18/68 
-7-
prohibiting racial discrimination in employment practices by any 
employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce. The letter 
further stated that the Board assumed that, whether or not executive 
orders of the President relating to discrimination were deemed legally 
binding on Federal Reserve Banks, each Bank would conform to the 
spirit of such orders. 
At this meeting Mr. O'Connell summarized a report that he had 
received with regard to events that had transpired at a hearing held 
recently in San Antonio, Texas, by the Civil Rights Commission, the 
subject being the extent to which equal opportunity for employment 
was being foreclosed. A panel of witnesses including an officer of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had been called to answer inquiries 
from the Commission, and at one point Counsel for the Commission made 
a statement that in his judgment Executive Order 11246 was applicable 
to the interests represented at the hearing, including the Federal 
Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank officer reportedly stated that the 
Bank felt the Executive Order was not applicable to it, although the 
spirit of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act had been accepted as 
applicable and the Bank s practices met the requirements of that title. 
Mr. O'Connell further stated that he understood that Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury Wallace, who was attending the hearing, then 
took the stand and made the statement that in his judgment Executive 
Order 11246 was applicable to the Reserve Banks. 

12/18/68 
-8-
The meeting then recessed to permit participation in a Board 
Christmas program and reconvened at 11:00 a.m. 
Governor Brimmer, who had gotten in touch with Assistant 
Secretary Wallace during the recess, reported that Mr. Wallace said 
he had taken the stand at the hearing because he felt that the 
situation was deteriorating rapidly, the Federal Reserve witness having 
devoted his time and effort to attempting to demonstrate that Executive 
Order 11246 was not applicable to the Reserve Banks and had no bearing. 
Mr. Wallace said it was his opinion, in which Treasury lawyers con-
curred, that the Federal Reserve Banks, as depositories of the 
Treasury, were subject to the Executive Order. 
There followed a general discussion during which Board members 
expressed regret that the incident had occurred and suggested steps 
that might be taken to improve the record and eliminate any misunder-
standings. The suggestions included sending a letter to the Presidents 
of the Reserve Banks reiterating the views expressed in the Board's 
1965 letter, communicating with the Dallas Reserve Bank by letter or 
otherwise, and communicating with the Civil Rights Commission, either 
direct or through the Reserve Bank. 
It was then agreed that before the Board proceeded further a 
transcript of the hearing should be obtained, that the matter would 
be reviewed by Governor Sherrill and Mr. O'Connell in the light of 
the transcript, that they would recommend such course of action as 

12/18/68 
-9-
seemed appropriate to them, and that the matter would then be con-
sidered further by the Board. 
Architectural consulting services. A decision by Mr. Eugene 
E. Witherell, the Board's consulting architect, to move to Florida 
had prompted consideration of alternatives. As set forth in a memo-
randum from Mr. Farrell dated December 16, 1968, those included: 
(1) continue the present arrangement with Mr. Witherell; (2) continue 
the present purpose and scope of the consulting arrangement but seek 
an individual or firm based in or near Washington; (3) continue the 
present scope and purpose of the consulting arrangement but seek an 
individual or firm felt to be best qualified, regardless of where 
located; and (4) expand the purpose and scope of the arrangement to 
provide more service for the Federal Reserve Banks and seek a firm 
capable of serving and commanding respect throughout the country. 
The basic purpose of the fourth alternative would be to 
minimize problems arising from lack of experience in the selection of 
an architect and lack of experience of architects with the peculiar 
requirements of Federal Reserve buildings. However, the consultant 
would not become involved in the exterior or overall design of a 
building unless requested by Reserve Bank management or the local 
architect. The consultant would stand ready to furnish the Board and 
its staff such review services or advice as might be needed. 
The question presented at this stage was whether to ask for the 
views of the Reserve Bank Presidents concerning the fourth alternative. 

* 1 4 1 3

In discussion it was indicated that the members of the Board's 
Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, along 
with Governor Sherrill, had considered the matter and that all except 
Governor Brimmer were inclined to feel that the fourth alternative 
was worthy of being submitted to the Presidents for an expression of 
their views. Board members brought out that that was the only step 
being suggested at this time; if the reaction of the Presidents 
developed to be favorable, consideration could then be given to pro-
cedures involved in implementing the program, including the possibility 
that in addition the Board might retain the services of an architect 
who would perform services corresponding essentially to those presently 
performed by Mr. Witherell. 
Governor Brimmer favored replacing Mr. Witherell with another 
consultant, hopefully from the Washington area, who would perform like 
services. As an alternative, he would suggest that the Board employ 
an architect who would be assigned to the Division of Federal Reserve 
Bank Operations. As he saw it, implementation of the fourth alterna-
tive presented in Mr. Farrell's memorandum would intrude into an 
important function traditionally exercised by Reserve Bank directors 
and would lead to delays and complications in Reserve Bank building 
programs. Accordingly, he would not even present the idea to the 
Presidents, particularly as a recommendation. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the staff was requested 
to prepare for the Board's consideration a letter that would present 

12/18/68 
-11-
the idea embodied in the fourth alternative to the Presidents for 
their views. 
Meetings with banker groups. In a memorandum dated 
December 12, 1968, Mr. Spencer of the Office of the Secretary outlined 
proposed arrangements for handling visits to the Federal Reserve 
Building by State bankers associations and certain other banker groups 
during the winter and spring months of 1969, along with arrangements 
for Board participation in dinners and receptions given by the respec-
tive groups. 
The arrangements, as outlined, were approved and payment of 
the cost of luncheons for the visiting groups was authorized. 
Board budget. Governor Sherrill introduced consideration of 
the Board budget for 1969 by saying that the Controller would present 
the proposed budget, as detailed in material heretofore made available 
to the members of the Board, in very general terms, highlighting 
particularly the new money involved and whether it reflected a previous 
Board decision or would represent a new commitment. Then the respec-
tive division heads would present their proposed budgets, not so much 
in terms of dollars as in terms of programs considered worthy of the 
Board's time and attention. 
Accordingly, Mr. Kakalec made an overall statement, following 
which Mr. Brill made a presentation on behalf of the Division of 
Research and Statistics. 

12/18/68 
-12-
Discussion followed with respect to the material that had 
been presented, and it was understood that the divisional presenta-
tions would be continued at another meeting. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Mr. Maxwell Carlson, President, 
National Bank of Commerce of Seattle, 
Second Avenue at Spring Street, 
Seattle, Washington. 98124 
Dear Mr. Carlson: 
With its letter of December 9, 1968 the Board enclosed a 
preliminary permit authorizing the organization of National Bank of 
Commerce (International), New York, New York ("NBCI"), under sec-
tion 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. Subsequently, it came to 
the Board's attention that the title of NBCI included the word 
"National" but did not clearly identify NBCI with its parent bank. 
Mr. Dahl of the Board's staff has discussed this matter by telephone 
with Mr. Kenneth J. Clark, Vice President and Cashier of your Bank. 
In view of the provisions of section 709 of the U. S. 
Criminal Code (18 U.S.C.) relating to the use of "national" in the 
title of a financial corporation, the Board has followed the prac-
tice of restricting the use of that term to situations where the 
Edge corporation's title clearly identifies with the parent bank. 
Accordingly, the Board suggests that in applying for a final permit, 
NBCI also submit an amendment to its articles of association which 
would either delete "national" from its title or insert the word 
"Seattle" in such title. 
Very truly yours 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATIONS BY HAWKEYE BANCORPORATION 
FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION OF VOTING SHARES 
OF BURLINGTON BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, BURLINGTON, IOWA; 
FIRST NATIONAL BANK, CLINTON, IOWA; AND 
THE PELLA NATIONAL BANK, PELLA, IOWA 
STATEMENT 
Hawkeye Bancorporation, Red Oak, Iowa ("Applicant"), a 
registered bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, 
Pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of 69 per 
cent or more of the voting shares of Burlington Bank and Trust Company, 
Burlington, Iowa ("Burlington Bank"), 51 per cent or more of the voting 
shares of First National Bank, Clinton, Iowa ("Clinton Bank"), and 
80 per cent or more of the voting shares of The Pella National Bank, 
Pella, Iowa ("Pella Bank"). Control of each of the proposed sub-
sidiary banks is currently held by a separate corporation organized 
and controlled by Applicant's President and his associates, and the 
acquisitions would be accomplished through merger of these corporations 
into Applicant. 

4429 
-2-
While each of the applications has been separately considered 
and is subject to a separate Board Order, because of common facts and 
circumstances, this Statement contains the Board's findings and con-
clusions with respect to all three. 
Views and recommendations of supervisory authorities. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board notified the Iowa Super-
intendent of Banking of receipt of the application relating to Burlington 
Bank and notified the Comptroller of the Currency of receipt of the 
applications relating to Clinton Bank and Pella Bank, and requested 
their views and recommendations thereon. Neither objected to 
approval of any of the applications. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
fchat the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in 
a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy 
to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in 
any Part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
acquisition 
the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 
°e substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a mono-
or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, 
unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the pro-
Posed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by 
the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience 
and needs of the community to be served. In each case the Board is 
Required to take into consideration the financial and managerial 

-3-
4130 
resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the 
banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to 
be served. 
Competitive effects of the proposed transactions. - Applicant 
1/ 
presently controls two banks with total deposits of about $20 million. 
Total deposits of Burlington Bank are about $23 million; Clinton Bank, 
$24 million; and Pella Bank, $12 million. Consummation of the three 
Proposed acquisitions would result in control by Applicant of 1.5 per 
cent of the deposits held by all commercial banks in the State of Iowa, 
and Applicant would become the State's seventh largest banking 
organization. 
The two present subsidiaries of Applicant are located in 
Red Oak, in the southwestern part of Iowa, and in Rock Rapids, in the 
extreme northwestern part of the State, respectively. These two 
cities are over 200 miles apart and each bank serves primarily its 
community and the immediately surrounding area. Burlington Bank 
is located in the extreme southeastern part of the State; Clinton 
Bank is located in the east central section of Iowa; and Pella Bank 
is located in the central section of the State. The five present and 
Proposed subsidiaries are well separated geographically; the shortest 
distance between any two of the five is over 100 miles. In view of 
the limited size of the banks involved and the distances separating 
y 
All banking data are as of December 30, 1967, unless otherwise 
noted. 

4131 
-4-
thera, and in the light of State law restrictions on branching, it does 
not appear that present or potential competition would be eliminated 
by 
consummation of any or all of the proposed acquisitions. 
The designated service area of Burlington Bank extends 
throughout Des Moines County and into portions of four neighboring 
counties. Its competition stems primarily from two other banks in 
Burlington, one slightly larger with deposits of $26.5 million and 
the other slightly smaller with deposits of $21 million, and second-
arily from six smaller banks located outside Burlington, which range 
in deposit size from about $2 million to $5 million. 
Clinton Bank competes primarily with two other banks in 
Clinton, each somewhat smaller than itself with deposits of about 
million and $13 million, respectively. Its designated service 
a r e a extends about 10 miles outside the City of Clinton within 
Clinton County, and into neighboring counties in Illinois. 
Pella Bank i3 the larger of two banks located in Pella. 
X t s Principal competitors, the only other banks located within the 
designated service area, are the other bank in Pella ($6.7 million 
s • 
deposits) and a small bank (about $2 million deposits) located eight 
miles southeast. In addition, some competition is provided by seven 
°ther banks, ranging in deposit size from $2 million to $14 million, 
^hich are located outside the service area 13 to 21 miles from Pella, 
^ut which compete to some extent for business originating within the 
area. 

4432 
-5-
Although each of the proposed subsidiary banks is already a 
strong competitor within the area which it serves, it does not appear 
that acquisition by Applicant will in any case adversely affect the 
viability or competitive effectiveness of competing banks, all of 
which have records of successful operation in the face of the com-
petition offered by the earlier mentioned affiliation already exist-
ing between Applicant and each of the proposed subsidiaries. 
In the light of these facts, the Board concludes that 
consummation of the proposed acquisitions would not result in a 
monopoly or be in furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or 
attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any area. It does 
not appear that consummation of any or all of the proposals would 
have the effect of substantially lessening competition or tending 
t o create a monopoly in any section of the country, or would in any 
manner be in restraint of trade. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant's management, and that of the present and proposed sub-
sidiary banks, appears reasonably satisfactory and the prospects of 
applicant and each of the banks appear favorable. 
Applicant's present debt position is sufficiently heavy 
in the absence of a firm program for substantial reduction or 
retirement, such debt would be an adverse consideration with respect 
t o the present applications. Further, the applications here con-
sidered envision the assumption by Applicant of additional debt now 

-6-
4433 
carried by the three corporations whose mergers with Applicant will 
effectuate the proposed acquisitions. Recognizing this problem, 
Applicant has committed itself to a public sale of stock which will 
provide sufficient funds to retire both its present debt and that 
which it proposes to assume. Applicant's firm commitment to this 
program of debt retirement warrants a finding that the financial 
condition of Applicant, as well as that of its present and proposed 
subsidiary banks, is reasonably satisfactory. 
Considerations relating to these factors are generally 
consistent with approval of the present applications and, to the 
extent that consummation of the proposed acquisitions will facilitate 
the raising of additional capital which will improve Applicant's 
financial condition and increase its ability to assist its subsidiary 
banks with respect to future capital needs, that consideration lends 
some weight toward approval of the applications. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. -
Consummation of the proposed acquisitions would permit expanded lines 
of credit to the agricultural industry, which represents a significant 
factor in the economy of each of the areas served by the present and 
Proposed subsidiary banks, through loan participations among the 
banks. In addition, Applicant asserts that each of the communities 
involved will be provided with more complete banking services, such 
as computer services, assistance to the communities in marketing 
bond issues, promotion of industrial expansion and development, and 

-7-
4434 
provision of trust services not now available in Pella. Contemplated 
improvements in auditing procedures and practices of the proposed 
subsidiaries, and standardization of forms, procedures, and systems, 
should benefit the banks and increase their effectiveness in serving 
their communities. 
Most of the asserted benefits to the communities can be, 
and to some extent presently are, provided under the loose affilia-
tion which now exists between the present and proposed subsidiaries. 
Consummation of the acquisitions, however, would facilitate such 
cooperation between the banks, and these considerations provide some 
additional weight in favor of approval of the applications. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in 
section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transactions would be in the public interest and that the applications 
should be approved.

Gentlemen: 
J 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has 
approved the applications of Hawkeye Bancorporation for permission to

°r more of the voting shares of Burlington Bank and Trust Company, 
Turlington; 51 per cent or more of the voting shares of First National

National Bank, Pella. The Board's Orders, accompanying Statement, and 
Press release are enclosed. 
Your attention is directed to the fact that, with respect to 
the financial aspects of the proposals, the Board's favorable consider-

°f both its presently outstanding debt and that which it will assume in 
connection with the acquisitions now approved. 
In connection with the provision of the Board's Orders relating 
to the time within which the acquisitions herein approved are to be 
consummated, advice of the fact of consummation should be given in writing 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY 
CHARTER BANKSHARES CORPORATION, JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, 
FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION OF VOTING SHARES OF 
FIRST NATIONAL BANK IN MILTON, MILTON, FLORIDA 
STATEMENT 
a 
Charter Bankshares Corporation, Jacksonville, Florida ("Applicant"), 
registered bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, 
Pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
U.S.C. 1342(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of 
80 
Per cent or more of the voting shares of First National Bank in 
Hllton, Milton, Florida ("Milton 3ank"). 
Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As 
Squired by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board notified the Comptroller 
of the Currency of receipt of the application and requested his views 
and 
recommendation thereon. The Comptroller recommended approval of the 
aPPlication. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
th 
a t the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
°nopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
m°nopoii2e the business of banking in any part of the United States. 
Nor m 
L 
m ay the Board approve a proposed acquisition the effect of which, in 
n y Section of the country, may be substantially to lessen competition, 

to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be 
in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive 
effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the 
Public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting 
convenience and needs of the community to be served. In each case, 
the Board is required to take into consideration the financial and 
managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company 
and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community 
to be served. 
Competitive effect of the proposed transaction. - Applicant, 
the smallest bank holding company in Florida, controls deposits of 
about $17 million, representing .18 per cent of the total deposits in 
State-.-i^upon completion of the acquisition proposed, Applicant 
w°uld control .27 per cent of the total deposits in the State and would 
remain the smallest bank holding company in Florida. Consummation of 
the proposal would not significantly affect the present degree of 
State-wide concentration. 
Milton Bank, which has deposits of $9.5 million, is located 
in Milton, Santa Rosa County, and primarily serves that city. Santa 
Ros a State Bank, with deposits of $7 million, is the only other bank 
l n Milton. and is a capable competitor of Milton Bank. 
Applicant's present subsidiary banks, Commercial National Bank 
°f Pensacola, Escambia County ($13.3 million deposits), and Bank of 
i/ Unless otherwise noted, all banking data are as of December 30, 1967. 

4410 
Gulf Breeze, Santa Rosa County ($3.6 million deposits), are located 
miles and 30 miles, respectively, from Hilton Bank. Although 
consummation of the proposed acquisition will give Applicant a second 
subsidiary bank in Santa Rosa County and will result in its controlling 
a large percentage of commercial bank deposits in the County, that 
circumstance is of limited significance in view of the locational 
factors which separate the trade areas served by Bank of Gulf Breeze 
and Milton Bank. The most convenient route between Gulf Breeze and Milton 
is through Pensacola, and the Pensacola Bay, which separates Gulf Breeze 
from Pensacola, serves as an additional barrier to travel between the 
two sections of the County. In the Pensacola Standard Metropolitan 
Statistical Area, which encompasses the areas served by all three banks, 
Applicant's share of deposits held by 13 banks would increase from . 
l0.3 p e r c e n t t o y^i p e r c e n t # 
It does not appear that any significant competition exists 
between Milton Bank and either of the subsidiary banks, due to their 
respective sizes and the distances and natural barriers which separate 
th 
ern- These same considerations, plus a State law prohibition of 
bi-tching, similarly limit the possibility that such competition 
^ght develop in the future. Finally, it is reasonably foreseen that 
th 
e acquisition proposed will increase the competitive ability of the 
acquired bank, without adversely affecting the viability or competitive 
effectiveness of competing banks. 
In the light of these facts, the Board concludes that 
c°nsuniniation of the proposed acquisition would not result in a monopoly 

°r be in furtherance «;f any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to 
Monopolize the business of banking in any area. It does not appear 
that consummation of the proposal would have the effect of substantially 
lessening competition or tending to create a monopoly in any section of 
country, 
would in any manner be in restraint of trade. 
Financial ,and managerial resourcj^s^and future prospects. -
The m 
management and prospects of Applicant, its present subsidiaries, and 
111 It on Bank are considered satisfactory. Capital of both Milton Bank and 
conimercial National Bank of Pensacola is somewhat low in relation to the 
dePosits of the banks, and Applicant proposes to increase the capital of 
k°th by amounts which appear sufficient to meet present needs. Based on 
tllat proposal, the Board finds the financial condition of Applicant, its 
Pfe 
sent subsidiaries, and Milton Bank to be reasonably satisfactory. 
Considerations under this factor are consistent with approval 
of c«e application, and, insofar as the proposed acquisition is a step in 
st 
rengthening the resources and overall operations of both Milton Bank 
ft*. 1 
Applicant, lend some weight in favor thereof. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - Consummation 
— — — — — — ___________________________———•— 
Applicant1 s proposal would not affect the convenience or needs of 
th e communities served by its present subsidiaries. 
The banking needs of the Milton community appear to be 
sonably well served by the two commercial banks located there, except 
with respect to trust services., Milton Bank has an inactive trust 
and Santa Rosa State Bank has none. Applicant plans to 
^r°Vide fiduciary services as they are needed by employing a trust officer 

nose services would be shared by the subsidiary banks ao required. 
The proposed affiliation could also facilitate loan participations 
between Milton Bank and Applicant's present subsidiaries, thus 
; • , 
Chancing Milton Bank's ability to serve the credit needs of its 
locality. 
These considerations are consistent with, and provide some 
additional weight in favor of, approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in 
Action 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest and that the application 
sh°uld be approved.

Dear Sir: 
At its December 16, 1968 meeting the Conference of 
Presidents approved a recoirmended policy statement on equal 
employment opportunity within the System and a ten-point 
program of action aimed at further progress in this field. 
The Board concurs in the policy position adopted by the 
Conference and strongly supports the measures proposed by the 
Conference aimed at effectuating its policy position. 
The Board understands that key emphasis in this • 
program will be placed upon reaching hard-core unemployed. 
It recognizes that such efforts may entail reasonable additional 
costs to the Reserve Banks, and it excepts such expenditures, 
subject to the safeguards contained in the Conference program, 
from the limiting 
provisions of preceding S-letters regarding 
the use of Reserve Bank funds for community projects. In 
view of the experimental nature of much of these efforts, the 
Board would appreciate receiving periodic progress reports. 
The Board staff will be prepared to work with the appropriate 
Reserve Bank representatives in developing such reporting 
procedures. 
Notice is taken of the tenth and final point in the 
proposed program of actions, calling for the designation of a 
senior officer of each Reserve Bank to report to the President 
or First Vice President with respect to the equal employment 
opportunity program. As this officer is essentially engaged 
in auditing each institution's program in this field, generally 
it would appear that this appointed officer should be outside 
the regular personnel function, and accessible to employees 
outside of the usual personnel channels. The Board has followed 

4444 
S-2074 
- 2 -
this approach, and asks that each Reserve Bank also give 
consideration to the value of distinguishing the officer who 
is to report on the equal employment opportunity program 
from its regular personnel administration. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.
