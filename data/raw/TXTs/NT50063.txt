Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller of 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger 
of The Racine Home Bank, Racine, Ohio, into The First National Bank of 
Racine, Racine, Ohio, was approved for transmittal to the Comptroller, 
the conclusion being stated as follows: 
The proposed merger of The Racine Home Bank and 
The First National Bank of Racine would eliminate one 
of two banks in Racine and would consequently elimi-
nate existing and potential competition. However, 
the community would seem to be too small to afford 
competition and to provide adequate support for two 
unit banks. Three other banks, which provide alter-
native banking services, are situated from 10 to 12 
miles from Racine. 
The meeting then adjourned.

granted by the Board on April 13, 1967, a 
letter was sent today to The Merchants Bank 
of New York, New York, New York, granting an 
extension of time, until May 31, 1967, for 
the bank to file a registration statement 
pursuant to section 12(g) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation F, Secu-
rities of Member State Banks.
