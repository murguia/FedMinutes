ADDRESS OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE 
TO THE BOARD 
November 16, 1967 
Board of Directors, 
Worthen Bank & Trust Company, 
Little Rock, Arkansas. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
approves the establishment by Worthen Bank & Trust Company, 
Little Rock, Arkansas, of a branch at 8100 Geyer Springs Road, 
Little Rock, Arkansas, provided the branch is established within 
one year from the date of this letter, and operations of the 
branch presently located at the intersection of Forbing Road and 
the new Benton Highway are simultaneously discontinued. 
In considering this application, the Board finds that 
your bank's management is satisfactory and has determined that 
the proposed branch will serve the convenience and needs of the 
community and will not tend to create an undesirable competitive 
situation. 
It is the Board's understanding that preliminary figures 
from the most recent examination report indicate your bank
f
s 
capital position is less than satisfactory. The Board further 
understands that management of your bank is giving consideration 
to means to improve this situation. The Board urges that plans 
be formulated and appropriate action be taken to improve your 
bank's capital position.

Item No. 3 
11/16/67 
November 16, 1967 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
issued revised guidelines, effective immediately, for financial 
institutions cooperating with the President's program of voluntary 
foreign credit restraint to improve the nation's balance of payments. 
Commercial banks again are asked to keep their foreign 
a s
sets within 109 per cent of the amount outstanding on December 31, 
the same target ceiling provided in the 1966 and 1967 programs. 
i» 
however, in an effort to provide some measure of flexibility in the 
Pr
°gram for banks that had relatively small bases on December 31, 1964, 
a b
ank with more than $500,000 in foreign assets on October 31, 1967, 
m a y 
a
dopt as a target ceiling for 1968 either its ceiling under the 
1-967 
' Program or 2 per cent of its total assets on December 31, 1966. 
®
ari
ks using the 2 per cent alternative are requested to use the 
^suiting increase in their ceiling over the 1967 amount solely to 
a
ke priority credits, that is, credits to finance exports of U.S. 
and services and credits to developing countries. 
Foreign credits of commercial banks increased by $120 million 
i n
 the fi r st three quarters of 1967, far less than the guidelines would 
h a v e
 Permitted. The banks were $783 million below the end-1967 ceiling 
°
n S e
Ptember 30, 1967, and $532 million below the interim ceiling 
f 
t e c
U V e on that date. 
In order to avoid a large outflow of funds in a short period 
time, which would be possible given the present leeway, all banks 
r
«quested to limit the use of the leeway between their 1968 ceilings 

4 3 7 4 
- 2 -
and the amount of foreign credits outstanding on October 31, 1967, 
to a rate not to exceed 20 per cent of the leeway per quarter, beginning 
w
ith the fourth quarter of 1967. In addition, all banks are requested 
to hold the level of non-export credits to developed countries of conti-
dental Western Europe to or below the amount outstanding on October 31, 1967. 
These changes are designed to tighten somewhat the overall 
restraint on the flow of bank capital abroad, to provide more equitable 
treatment for banks that had small bases on December 31, 1964, and to 
give further stimulus for export financing. 
The program for nonbank financial institutions (which include 
insurance companies, trust companies, mutual savings banks, etc.) 
r e
mains substantially the same as that for 1967. The target ceiling 
PPHcable to assets covered by the guidelines has been increased from 
per cent of adjusted base date holdings, effective through 1967, 
• 
• : 
..

t o
 109 per cent of such holdings for 1968. 
• > o ' ,

The reporting requirement has been modified by providing

t only those institutions holding at least $500,000 in covered assets 
$5 
million in total foreign assets are requested to report regularly 
t o
 the Federal Reserve Bank in their district. It is estimated that 
^ i s will reduce the number of reporting institutions from about 575 to 
"bout 340. 
In announcing the new guidelines the Board expressed its 
a
PPreciation for the effectiveness of the cooperation given by the 
flt
*ancial community since the inauguration of the voluntary restraint 
Pr
°Bram in 1965, and its confidence that such cooperation would be

PREFACE TO GUIDELINES 
1968 
The financial community has continued its excellent cooperation 
w
ith the President's voluntary foreign credit restraint program during 
Foreign credits of commercial banks increased by only $120 million 
the first three quarters of 1967, far less than would have been 
P
e
rmltted by the guidelines. The banks were $783 million below the end-
1967 ceiling on September 30, 1967 and $532 million below the interim 
filing 
effective on that date. Foreign claims of nonbank financial 
^stitutions subject to the guidelines declined by $76 million, or 3.9 
P e r
 cent, during the first six months of 1967. These institutions were 
million below the target ceiling at the end of June 1967. 
However, the balance of payments situation has not improved 
d u
ring 1967, and it is considered necessary to continue the voluntary 
to restrain the outflow of private capital. Accordingly, the 
of Governors has revised the guidelines for financial institutions 
8 e
t out hereinafter. 
Program for Coirmercinl Banks 
The 1968 ceiling for banks accounting for about 95 per cent of 
t h e
 1967 ceiling will remain at the level for 1967, generally 109 per 
C 6 n t
 of the end-1964 base. Banks whose ceiling target for 1967 was less 
t l
*
a n
 2 p e r 
c e n t 
0 f total assets as of December 31, 1966, may take the 
l a t t
e r figure as their 1968 ceiling. Such banks are requested to use 

the 
4 3 7 7 
-2-
a t n o u n
t of the increase over their 1967 ceilings only for priority 
C r
edits, i.e., export credits or credits to developing countries. 
•.v'^v-'v ^ . . 
The leeway available on September 30, 1967, together with 
t h
e increase in the 1968 ceiling related to the alternative method of 
C a
lculating that ceiling, provides a potential leeway for an outflow 
0
 bank credit in 1968 of about $1.4 billion. Therefore, each commercial 
b a
nk again is requested to limit the use of its leeway over the year; 
tH 
a t
 is, to use not more than 20 per cent of the leeway available as 
0 f
 °ctober 31. before January 1, 1968, not more than 40 per cent before 
A 
*

n o t
 more than 60 per cent before July 1, 1968, and not 
1001:6
 than 80 per cent before October 1, 1968. 
Furthermore, banks are requested to hold nonexport credits to 
e
l°ped countries of continental Western Europe to or below the level 
•

ch credits outstanding on October 31, 1967.

 designed to tighten somewhat the overall restraint on flows

K
 capital abroad, to reduce inequities which have built up over 
the i^t 
t e
 of the program, and to give a further stimulus to banks to direct 
credits to export financing and to the financing of the 
°Ping countries. 
ram for Nonbank Financial Insitutions 
There are no substantial changes in the 1968 guidelines for 
n
°
nb
*nk f< 
tinancial institutions. The definition of "covered" assets 
«»ned in the 1967 guidelines still applies. The target ceiling 
• 

4 3 7 8 
applicable to covered assets has been increased from 105 per cent of 
adjusted base date holdings, effective through 1967, to 109 per cent 
for 1968. 
Reporting requirements are eased by providing that only 
financial institutions holding covered assets of $500,000 or more, or 
total foreign assets of $5 million or more, are expected to report to 
their Federal Reserve Bank. It is estimated that this will reduce the 
number of reporting institutions from about 575 to about 340. 
The group of institutions covered by the nonbank guidelines 
deludes trust companies and trust departments of commercial banks, 
Mutual savings banks, insurance companies, investment companies, finance 
companies, employee retirement and pension funds, college endowment 
funds, and charitable foundations. Also included are the U.S. branches 
°f foreign insurance companies and of other foreign nonbank financial 
c
°
r
Porations. Investment underwriting firms, securities brokers and 
balers, a n <j investment counseling firms also are covered with respect 
t o
 foreign financial assets held for their own account and are requested 
t o
 inform their customers of the program in those cases where it appears 
a
PPlicable.

The 1968 ceiling for a bank 
^Porting on Form F.R. 391 on October 31, 1967, and that had foreign 
S e t
s of more than $500,000on that date, is the bank's 1967 ceiling for 
U c h
 credits or 2 per cent of the bank's total assets on December 31, 1966, 
W h i
chever is larger. 
However, all banks are requested to limit their outstanding

C- f: 
(2) A bank that had no ceiling in 1967, or that had foreign 
assets of $500,000 or less on October 31, 1967, may discuss with the 
Federal Reserve Bank of the Federal Reserve district in which it is 
located, the possibility of adopting a ceiling that would permit the bank 
to meet the reasonable foreign credit requirements of existing customers 
needs originating in its normal trade area, but such special ceilings 
shall in no case be more than 2 per cent of a bank's total assets as of 
December 31, 1966. 
In discussing the ceiling of such a bank, the Federal Reserve 
B a
n k will ascertain the bank's previous history in foreign transactions, 
deluding acceptance of foreign deposits or handling foreign collections, 
a
nd the reasons why the bank considers that it should engage in foreign 
transactions.

Reporting 
(1) Banks that report on Treasury Foreign Exchange FormsB-2 
or that have been granted a special ceiling under Section C(2)

Loans Guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank 
Loans guaranteed or participated in by the Export-Import Bank 
v t
 insured by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association are excluded from 
th 
ii 
ceiling. The role of the Export-Import Bank within the framework of 
t h e
 President's program is coordinated by the National Advisory Council 
£ 
°
r
 International Monetary and Financial Policies. 
^Igdits in Excess of Ceiling 
A bank would not be considered as acting in a manner inconsistent 
Vtth th 
Program if it temporarily exceeds its interim ceiling as a result 
t h e
 (a) drawdown of binding commitments entered into before November 16, 
i or (b) extension of bona fide export credits. 
The bank should, however, refrain from making new extensions of 
Priority credits so as to reduce its claims on foreigners to an amount 
n
 the ceiling as quickly as possible. 
It should also take every 
o p p o 
rtunity to withdraw or reduce commitments, including credit lines, 
that a r 
e
 not of a firm nature and to assure that drawings under credit 
l i n
*s ar, i

P t to normal levels and usage. At time of renewal, each 
C t e
<Ut H 
J-ine should be reviewed for consistency with the program. 
^ 
A bank whose foreign credits are in excess of the ceiling will 
n v
*ted periodically to discuss with the appropriate Federal Reserve 
the « 
steps it has taken and proposes to take to reduce its credits to 
l e V e l
 within its ceiling.

Loan Priorities 
Within the ceiling, absolute priority should be given to bona 
fide export credits. Credits that substitute for cash sales or for sales 
customarily financed out of nonbank or foreign funds are not entitled to 
Priority. 
With respect to nonexport credits, banks should give the high-
est priority to loans to developing countries and should avoid re-
strictive policies that would place an undue burden on Canada, Japan, 
a
nd the United Kingdom. 
It is further expected that the outstanding amount of nonexport 
C r
edits to developed countries in continental Western Europe will not be 
increased during 1968 above the amount outstanding on October 31, 1967. 
A bank adopting a 1968 ceiling equal to 2 per cent of its 
total assets on December 31, 1966, will be expected to use the excess 
0 v
^r its 1967 ceiling only for priority credits — export credits and 
credits to developing countries — originating among the bank's regular 
C u
stomers or residents of its trade territory. That is, holdings 
°f foreign credits on any reporting date should not exceed the 1967 
filing by more than the increase in holdings of priority credits between 
°ctober 31, 1967, and the reporting date. 
Trust Departments 
Trust departments of commercial banks should follow the guide-
lines with respect to nonbank financial institutions.

Transactions for the Account of Customers 
A bank should bear in mind the President's balance of payments 
Program when acting for the account of a customer. Although the bank must 
follow a customer's instructions,it should not encourage customers to 
Place liquid funds outside the United States. A bank should not place 
ttith 
a customer foreign obligations that, in the absence of the volun-
tary credit restraint program, it would have acquired or held for its own 
a c
count. 
Foreign Branches 
The voluntary credit restraint program is not designed to re-
s t
*ict the extension of foreign credits by foreign branches if the funds 
u t
ilized 
are derived from foreign sources and do not add to the outflow 
o f
 capital from the United States. 
Total claims of a bank's domestic offices on its foreign 
Ranches (including permanent capital invested in as x^ell as balances due 
f r
om such branches) represent bank credit to nonresidents for the purposes 
the program. 
o 
l^Edge Act" Corporations 
"Edge Act" and "Agreement" Corporations are included in the 
v
°luntary credit restraint program. Foreign loans and investments of such 
c
°
r
Porations may be combined with those of the parent bank, or a separate 
C e
iling may be adopted for the parent bank and each such subsidiary corpo-
t a
t i 0 n . 
If such corporation is owned by a bank holding company, its 
^°reign loans and investments may be combined for purposes of the program 
W l t
h any one or all of the banks in the holding company group.

Branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United 
S
tates are requested to act in accordance with the spirit of the domestic 
commercial bank voluntary credit restraint program.

o a n s
 to U. S. Residents and Substitution of Domestic Credit for 
Credit from Foreign Sources 
There are a number of situations in which loans to domestic 
C u s
tomers, individual as well as corporate, may be detrimental to the 
p 
resident's balance of payments program and hence should be avoided. 
Samples are: 
(A) Loans to U. S. residents — individuals as well as corpo-
r
ations--that will aid the borrower in making new foreign loans or invest-
ments inconsistent with the President's program. 
Banks should avoid 
taking new loans that would directly or indirectly enable borrowers to 
U s e
 funds abroad in a manner inconsistent with the Department of Commerce 
Pr
°gram or with the guidelines for nonbank financial institutions. 
(B) Loans to U. S. subsidiaries and branches of foreign com-
panies that otherwise might have been made by the bank to the foreign 
P a r
ent or other foreign affiliate of the company, or that normally would 
**
av
e been obtained abroad. 
u 
M 
Management of a Bank's Liquid Funds 
A bank should not place its own funds abroad for short-term in-
L
ment purposes, whether such investments are payable in foreign curren-
or in U. S. dollars. 
This does not, however, call for a reduction in 
c
ie s 
essary working balances held with foreign correspondents. 

GUIDELINES F6R NONBANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
Through the end of calendar year 1968, each institution is 
guested to limit its aggregate holdings of "covered" foreign financial 
ass
ets to not more than 109 per cent of its "adjusted base-date holdings." 
°
Ve
red foreign assets and adjusted base-date holdings are defined as in 
1967 program. 
Covered foreign financial assets, subject to the guideline 
t n
8 , include the following types of investments: 
1. Foreign bank deposits, including deposits in foreign branches 
of U c . 
banks, and liquid money market claims on foreign obligors, generally 
defj e
d to include marketable negotiable instruments maturing in 1 year or 
le.<s„ 
2. All other claims on foreign obligors written to mature in 
10 y e a r s
 or less at date of acquisition. 
This category includes all bonds, 
n°te s » mortgages, loans, and other credits, regardless of country of origin. 
^Xq 1 
e
d are bonds and notes of international institutions of which the 
Stat es is a member, and loans guaranteed or participated in by the 
E*Po t t t 
"import Bank or insured by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association, 
8 a r d
less of maturity. 
3. Net financial investment in foreign branches, financial sub-
and affiliates, located in developed countries other than 
Ca
nada a . 
l 
a
nd Japan. 
Such financial investment includes payments into equity 
°ther capital accounts of, and net loans and advances to, foreign 
N o t at:
ions engaged principally in finance, insurance, or real estate 
a
<Uv t t f l e
s , in which the U.S. institution has an ownership interest of 
1 0
 
c 
^ent or more. 
Excluded are earnings of a foreign affiliate directly 
in the capital accounts of the foreign corporation.

( 
4. Long-term credits of foreign obligors domiciled in developed 
c
°untries other than Canada and Japan.* 
Included in this category are 
k°nds, notes, mortgages, loans, and other credits maturing more than 10 
aft er date of acquisition. 
Excluded are bonds of international 
*
ns
titutions of which the United States is a member. 
5. Equity securities of foreign corporations domiciled in 
^
ev
eloped countries other than Canada and Japan* except those acquired 
e r
 September 30, 1965, in U.S. markets from American investors. 
The 
6 s t
 of whether an equity security is covered will depend on the institution's 
ligation to pay the Interest Equalization Tax on acquisition. 
Exclusion 
t 0 t n
 covered assets under this program normally will be indicated when, in 
f i r i n g an equity security that otherwise would be covered, the purchasing 
titution 
receives a certificate of prior American ownership, or brokerage 
C
°
nf
irmation thereof. 
"Base-date" holdings for any reporting date are defined as: 
sser of (a) total holdings of covered foreign assets as of 
Member 30, 1966, or (b) the amount 
of covered foreign assets that 
c
°Uld . 
nave been held as of September 30, 1966, in compliance with the guide-
line 
C e
ilings established by the 1966 voluntary program; less (2) equity 
u
*itj.es of 
companies domiciled in developed countries (except Canada 
Pan),* that are included in (1) but had been sold to American 
tors prior to the current quarter. 
"Adjusted" base-date holdings, 
^ i c h the 109 per cent ceiling applies, are equal to "base-date" holdings 
def 
*ined above, less sales of included covered equities'during the 
c
Utl •
f
ent quarter.

In making foreign loans and investments subject to the guideline 
C e
Uing > institutions are asked to give absolute priority to credits that 
re
Present the bona fide financing of U.S. exports, i. e., financing necessary 
0 c
°nsummate the export sale. In the case of credits to developed countries, 
ne
cessitous export financing purpose will be indicated whenever the credit 
S
 tempted from the Interest Equalization Tax, which would otherwise apply. 
Tetn Porary excesses above the guideline ceiling may be permitted, where neces-
r y
> in order to accommodate these priority credits, but any institution 
that 
exceeds its target should consult with the Federal Reserve Bank of 
the 
reserve district in which it is located regarding a program for moving 
wi
-thin the ceiling in a reasonable period of time. 
Within the leeway provided by the 109 per cent ceiling, institutions 
•lio ar requested to give priority consideration to the financing needs 
of th 
e
 developing countries, and to avoid restrictive policies that.. „ 
Place an undue burden on Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. 
But 
t h e
 in 
v
estment of liquid funds abroad, in both bank deposits and money market 
in8tt uments, should be held to minimum practicable levels consistent with 
t h
* On 
p e r
ating policies of the institution. Moreover, investments in assets 
o t
 n i , 
c
ypes in the developed countries of continental Western Europe, except 
directly financing U.S. exports, should not be permitted to exceed 
% 
t 
t a
l of such assets held on September 30, 1967. 
V 
Foreign financial assets not covered by the guideline are still 
t e P o t t a M 
°le on the quarterly statistical reports to the Federal Reserve 
h 
'
 
u t
 are not subject to ceiling limitations. Such noncovered foreign 
S 8 t ^ents include the following:

- u -
1. Bonds and notes of international institutions of which the 
^
n
ited States is a member, regardless of maturity. 
2. Long-term investments in Canada, Japan, and all developing 
Entries. including credit instruments with final maturities of more than 
u
 years at date of acquisition, direct investment in financial subsidiaries, 
all equity securities 
issued by firms domiciled in these countries. 
3. Equity securities of firms in developed countries other than 
^
a
nada and Japan that have been acquired in U.S. markets from American 
inv
estors (see Point 5 above). 
Each nonbank financial institution holding, on any quarterly 
te
Porting date, covered assets of $500,000 or more, or total foreign 
U n c i a l assets of $5 million or more, is requested to file a statistical 
*
e
P°rt, covering its total holdings on that date, with the Federal Reserve 
of the Federal Reserve district in which its principal office is 
*°
c
ated. The reports are due within 20 days following the close of each 
er
»dar quarter, and forms (F.R. 392R) may be obtained by contacting

 federal Reserve Bank. 
GE
^HRal CONSIDERATIONS 
In cooperating in the voluntary foreign credit restraint program, 
n
°nbank financial institutions are requested to refrain from making 
L
°ans 
0
nd investments inconsistent with other aspects of the President's 
U C e
 of payments program. Among these are the following: 
(1) noncovered 
t-
under this program that substitute for loans that commercial banks 
have made in the absence of that part of the program applicable to them; 

4 3 9 1 
- 5 -
(2) credits to U.S. corporate borrowers that would enable them to make new 
foreign loans and investments inconsistent with that part of the program 
Ministered by the Department of Commerce; (3) credits to U.S. subsidiaries 
branches of foreign companies that otherwise would have been made to the 
*°
re
ign parent, or that would substitute for funds normally obtained from 
^°teign sources. 
The voluntary foreign credit restraint program for nonbank finan-
institutions does not apply to the investment, within the country 
Evolved, of reserves accumulated on insurance policies sold abroad, in 
atn
°unts up to 110 per cent of such reserves. Furthermore, in view of the 
inc 
bg] _ 
A
«nce of payments objectives of the program, it is noted that covered 
e
stments of nonbank financial institutions may be permitted to exceed 
guideline ceiling to the extent that the funds for such investment 
t e
 borrowed in developed countries other than Canada and Japan. Any such 
a n
gements to offset foreign borrowing against foreign investment should 
U
*ccussed with the Federal Reserve Bank.
