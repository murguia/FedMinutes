Approved letters. The following letters were approved unani-
mously after consideration of background information that had been made 
available to the Board. Copies of the letters are attached under the 
respective item numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
1 
interposing no objection to the 1968 foreign 
travel program approved by the Bank's Board of 
Directors. 

2/8/68 
-2-
Item No. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
2 
approving the payment of salary to Albert Spencer, 
Jr., as Assistant Vice President at the rate fixed 
by the Bank's Board of Directors. 
Letter to the Bureau of the Budget regarding 
3 
enrolled bill H.R. 13094, amending the Commodity 
Exchange Act. 
In connection with Item No. 1, Chairman Martin commented that 
he had discussed the New York Bank's proposed foreign travel program 
with President Hayes, who had pointed out that the program contem-
plated a substantial curtailment from recent years. The Chairman said 
he had suggested to Mr. Hayes that it would be desirable for the Bank 
to eliminate this year all foreign travel that was not essential. 
With 
the understanding that the Bank would have that in mind, he (Chairman 
Martin) saw no reason why the Board should interpose objection to the 
program. 
Governor Mitchell referred to a few travel items in the program 
that he thought might be eliminated on further study, and it was under-
stood that he would talk with President Hayes concerning them. 
With respect to Item No. 3, the Board decided against including 
in the letter to the Bureau of the Budget a notation that the enrolled 
bill did not provide authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to set 
margin requirements for trading in commodities. 
In a letter to the 
Budget Bureau of June 29, 1967, commenting on a draft of the bill, the 
Board had expressed the view that the powers available for regulating 

2/8/68 
-3-
commodity trading should include at least discretionary authority to 
prescribe minimum margin requirements. A reason suggested for not 
repeating that view was that the Board did not want to recommend that 
the President withhold approval of the enrolled bill; also, that the 
matter of prescribing minimum margin requirements, a complex matter, 
was one that the Department of Agriculture presumably could raise 
again in the future if it so desired. 
Reserve city status of National Bank of Washington (Item No. 4) 
There had been distributed a memorandum dated February 6, 1968, from 
the Legal Division regarding a question relating to the status for 
reserve requirement purposes of National Bank of Washington, Tacoma, 
Washington. 
In September 1967 the Board had held that the Bank Holding 
Company Act would permit the indirect acquisition by Western Bancorpora 
tion through the National Bank of Washington, its subsidiary, of the 
stock of a mortgage company that would solicit, process, and service 
mortgage loans on behalf of the national bank. The mortgage company 
had two offices in Seattle, a "reserve city" under the Board's Regula-
tion D, Reserves of Member Banks. The regulation provides that a 
Â« 
member bank shall be considered to be in a reserve city if the head 
office or any branch thereof is located in a reserve city. 
In largely similar circumstances the Board had held in 1963 
and 1964 that offices of such a subsidiary mortgage company consti-
tuted branches of Mercantile Trust Company, St. Louis, Missouri. 

2/8/68 
-4-
(Mercantile Trust Company then converted to a national charter and the 
then Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Saxon, held that the offices were 
not branches.) 
It might be argued that the Board's Mercantile Trust 
ruling was not necessarily controlling in determining whether the 
Seattle offices of National Bank of Washington's subsidiary mortgage 
company were branches under Regulation D; the purposes underlying 
reserve requirements were different from those requiring supervisory 
approval for the establishment of branches and prohibiting out-of-State 
branches. Nevertheless, the Legal Division did not believe there was 
any persuasive reason in this case for departing from the rationale of 
the Mercantile Trust ruling, especially since National Bank of Wash-
ington would be entitled to apply to the Board for permission to main-
tain reserves at the lower levels set for banks not in reserve cities. 
In fact, the Division considered this course preferable, for procedural 
reasons. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco that would hold that the Seattle offices 
of National Bank of Washington were branches but would request that the 
national bank's attention be called to the provisions of Regulation D 
regarding applications for permission to maintain reduced reserves. 
After comments by Mr. Doyle, Governor Mitchell expressed the 
view that the recommended position seemed sound, although it might 
have some elements of inconsistency with certain other decisions the 

543 
2/8/68 
-5-
Board had made recently. However, until action could be obtained on 
legislative proposals that would eliminate the complexities of admin-
istering reserve requirements according to a bank's location, he 
believed it might be simpler and more appropriate to solve problems 
such as the present one by holding that the offices in question were 
not branches for purposes of establishing reserve requirements. Al-
though that position would involve some modification of the Board's 
ruling in the Mercantile Trust case, he would be disposed to take that 
course in order to avoid putting the bank to the trouble and expense 
of making a case for an application for permission to carry reduced 
reserves. 
Mr. Hexter expressed the view that departure from the Board's 
long-standing and carefully-reasoned position that offices such as 
here in question were branches would be too great a price to pay for 
the expedient of relieving the bank from applying for continuance of 
its country bank status. 
Governor Robertson suggested that both purposes might be served 
if the Board took the position that the offices were branches but at 
the same time granted permission to the bank to carry country bank 
reserves, so long as those offices did not accept deposits. 
Chairman Martin and Governors Mitchell and Sherrill indicated 
that Governor Robertson's suggestion seemed an acceptable procedure, 
but Governor Brimmer noted that parties in Seattle had expressed concern 

2/8/68 
-6-
that allowing National Bank of Washington to acquire the mortgage com-
pany had the effect of permitting the bank to enter the Seattle com-
petitive scene. He was troubled that the course suggested would not 
allow an opportunity for competing banks to protest, as they might 
have if applications had been filed for the establishment of branches. 
Mr. Hexter asked if he was correct in understanding that the 
Board intended the suggested position to apply only to the present 
case, without any commitment toward a general position that any country 
bank that had non-deposit offices in a reserve city could retain its 
country bank status for reserve requirement purposes. That understand-
ing having been verified, Mr. Hexter said that the procedure Governor 
Robertson had suggested had not been considered by the Legal Division. 
Before it was implemented, he would like to study it further in terms 
of the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
suggested course would be explored by the Legal Division, and that if 
there appeared to be no legal obstacle the procedure would be followed. 
Secretary's Note: Further study by the 
Legal Division suggested that a letter 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Fran-
cisco in the form attached as Item No. 4 
would be preferable and, with the approval 
of Governor Robertson, that letter was 
sent. 
Policy record entries. With a memorandum from Mr. Broida 
dated February 6, 1968, there had been distributed copies of policy 

543 
2/8/68 
-7-
record entries for the Federal Open Market Committee meetings of 
November 14, November 27, and December 12, 1967. All three of the 
entries were approved by the Board on January 25, 1968, and were sub-
sequently distributed to the Reserve Bank Presidents. No changes had 
been made thereafter in the language of the entries. 
It was proposed to release the entry regarding the November 14 
meeting to the press on Monday afternoon, February 12, 1968, with sub-
sequent publication in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. The entry was 
submitted for final review of language prior to publication; Board 
approval was also requested for a covering press release, a draft of 
which was attached to the memorandum. 
It was planned to release the policy record entries for the 
November 27 and December 12 meetings on the usual 90-day schedule 
(February 26 and March 11, 1968, respectively) unless a request for 
them was received from a Congressional source prior to those dates, 
and, in the latter case, to release them to the press at the same time 
they were supplied to the Congress. Although no such request had been 
received at the time the memorandum was written, the entries were sub-
mitted for final review at this time to facilitate a prompt response 
if a request was received. 
The Board unanimously approved the release of the November 14 
entry to the press on Monday, February 12, 1968, and the release pro-
cedure described by the staff with respect to the entries for the 
November 27 and December 12 meetings.

Salary for officer at New York Reserve Bank (Items 5 and 6). 
There had been distributed a memorandum dated February 1, 1968, from 
the Division of Personnel Administration regarding a request from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York for approval of payment of salary to 
Frank W. Schiff, Assistant Vice President, at the rate of $28,000 per 
annum effective February 11, 1968. Mr. Schiff had been on leave with-
out pay since September 1964 to serve on the staff of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers and there had been no change in his salary 
of $19,000 per annum during the period of his leave. The Treasury 
Department had announced that, effective February 12, 1968, Mr. Schiff 
would be appointed Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary 
Affairs. 
The memorandum brought out that under the provisions of sec-
tion 5A of the Rules and Regulations of the Retirement System of the 
Federal Reserve Banks the effect of the proposed increase in Mr. 
Schiff's salary would be to increase substantially the pension portion 
of his retirement allowance. Under section 5A, the Reserve Bank would 
pay not only the employer's contribution to the Retirement System but 
also the employee's contribution during his period of absence for pur-
poses of public service. The total of the combined contributions by 
the Reserve Bank during the next five years attributable to the pro-
posed $9,000 increase would be about $4,100. 

543 
2/8/68 
-9-
The Division noted that in the past the Board had taken the 
position that increases for Reserve Bank officers in the year before 
retirement were normally not desirable because they might be motivated 
merely by a desire to provide higher retirement allowances. 
That 
principle might be considered applicable to Mr. Schiff's case, although 
the circumstances were not completely parallel. 
After comments by Mr. Johnson, Governor Mitchell expressed the 
view that the key question seemed to be whether or not Mr. Schiff would 
return to the employ of the Reserve Bank after his Treasury service. 
The Division's reservations appeared to rest upon an assumption that 
he would not return. However, Governor Mitchell had talked with Pres-
ident Hayes of the New York Reserve Bank, who had indicated that it was 
expected that Mr. Schiff would return. In that event, the New York 
recommendation took on a different aspect. 
Governor Brimmer said that he too was disposed to approve the 
Reserve Bank's action. 
If Mr. Schiff had remained at the Bank during 
the last several years his salary no doubt would have been increased 
periodically. The omission of increases for Mr. Schiff might have 
been attributable to the rule that no more than 40 per cent of a 
Reserve Bank's officers should be given merit salary increases in one 
year. 
It was his belief that the Bank had expected to make an appro-
priate adjustment when Mr. Schiff returned. Since the salaries of Mr. 
Schiff's colleagues had moved up during the period of Mr. Schiff's 

2/8/68 
-10-
absence, Governor Brimmer regarded the proposed increase as a correc-
tion of a situation that should not have been allowed to develop. 
Chairman Martin inquired whether the Division's views would 
have been different if it were known that Mr. Schiff would return to 
the Reserve Bank. Mr. Johnson responded that the Division had not 
made such an assumption because the Reserve Bank's letter requesting 
approval did not mention it as one of the reasons for the salary 
increase. 
It was true that if Mr. Schiff did return to the Bank the 
period of his service at the Treasury Department would count in comput-
ing his retirement benefits. However, it might be noted also that the 
proposed increase was large, its purpose apparently being to bring Mr. 
Schiff's salary to the amount he would receive at the Treasury Depart-
ment. While the Bank indicated that if his service had been continuous 
he would probably have received increases totaling "several thousand 
dollars," the question was whether they would have aggregated as much 
as $9,000. 
Governor Mitchell observed that even with the proposed increase 
Mr. Schiff would have suffered some inequity as far as retirement bene-
fits were concerned because during his service with the Council the 
Reserve Bank's contributions, both its own and those on his behalf, 
were based on a salary of $19,000. 
Governor Sherrill commented that he shared Governor Brimmer's 
regret that the Reserve Bank had not moved Mr. Schiff's salary upward 

543 
2/8/68 
-11-
during his service with the Council. While the proposed solution of 
the matter presented some questions, Governor Sherrill leaned toward 
approving a salary commensurate with the salary Mr. Schiff would 
receive at the Treasury Department. 
Governor Robertson said he believed the proposed salary was 
justified and would approve it, but only if the record was amplified 
to make clear the justification. 
Governor Brimmer concurred that it would be desirable to aug-
ment the record; he suggested that it include information regarding 
salary increases given in the last several years to Reserve Bank offi-
cers who were at about the same level as Mr. Schiff at the time he 
began service with the Council. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the Board approved unani-
mously, subject to the understanding that additional information along 
the lines mentioned would be placed in the record, a letter to the New 
York Reserve Bank that would approve the proposed salary increase. A 
copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 5. Attached as Item No. 6 
is a copy of a memorandum subsequently placed in the files by the Board's 
Secretary. 
Revision of Regulation Y (Items 7 and 8). On January 25, 1968, 
the Board approved sending to the Federal Reserve Banks for comment a 
proposed revision of Regulation Y , Bank Holding Companies, that would 
incorporate into the regulation the substantive changes made in the law 
by the 1966 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act. 

2/8/68 
-12-
At today's meeting Mrs. Heller reported that although a number 
of changes had been made in the draft revision in the light of Reserve 
Bank comments, these were of a technical rather than a substantive 
nature. Not all of the suggestions received had been incorporated in 
the revision because a number of the points raised had been met in 
other ways. 
If the Board approved, it was now proposed to publish the 
revision in the Federal Register as an adopted regulation. 
The Board unanimously approved the revised Regulation Y, effec-
tive March 15, 1968. A copy of the revised regulation in the form in 
which it was sent to the Federal Register is attached as Item No. 7. 
Attached as Item No. 8 is a notice sent to the Federal Register regard-
ing a technical conforming amendment, also approved unanimously by the 
Board, to the Board's Rules of Procedure. 
Foreign travel. The Board authorized travel by Robert C. 
Holland, Secretary of the Board, to accompany Governor Robertson to 
Basle, Switzerland, for the March monthly meeting of the Bank for Inter 
national Settlements, with any brief stopover visits en route to or 
from the meeting that might prove to be desirable. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: 
Governor Robertson 
today approved on behalf of the Board 
the following items: 
Memorandum from the Director of the Division of International 
Finance dated February 8, 1968, recommending that Robert L. Sammons, 
Associate Director of that Division, be designated to lecture at 
the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies during the period 

rr i r-
OiO 
2/8/68 
-13-
August 5-17, 1968, and that Mr. Sammons be authorized to undertake 
the necessary travel to Mexico, it being understood that he would 
receive per diem in accordance with the Standardized Government 
Travel Regulations. 
Memorandum from the Division of Research and Statistics recom-
mending an increase in the basic annual salary of A. Jane Moore, Econ-
omist in that Division, from $11,589 to $12,607, effective February 11, 
1968. 
On February 8, 1968, action was taken 
on behalf of the Board under delegated 
authority as indicated by the following

Dear Mr. Treiber: 
This is in reply to your letter of February 1, 1968, 
with which you enclosed copies of the foreign travel program 
of your Bank for 1968 as approved by your board of directors. 
It is noted that in formulating the foreign travel program, 
due consideration was given to the President's balance of pay-
ments program as it affects travel abroad and to the Board's 
letter of February 2, 1967, requesting that care be taken to 
avoid official travel not consistent with the System's responsi-
bilities. 
The Board has reviewed the foreign travel program 
and interposes no objection to your proceeding on the basis of 
the plans as outlined. Should there be modifications in the 
program during the course of the year, the Board would appre-
ciate being advised. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland

San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. Swan: 
In a letter dated September 5, 1967, to counsel for 
National Bank of Washington, Tacoma, Washington ("NBW"), the Board 
concluded that section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Bank Holding Company Act 
would permit the indirect acquisition by Western Bancorporation, 
through NBW (its subsidiary), of the stock of a mortgage company 
operating two offices in Seattle. 
The Board has recently considered whether these two 
offices would be "branches" of NBW for the purposesof Â§ 204.2(a)(3) 
of Regulation D and concluded that they should be so considered. 
However, in view of the limited functions performed at such offices, 
including the fact that they do not accept deposits, the Board also 
concluded that, upon application by NBW pursuant to Â§ 204.2(a)(2) 
of the Regulation, permission would be granted to maintain reserves 
at the lower levels in effect for member banks not located in re-
serve cities. This conclusion would be reconsidered if the func-
tions at those offices were materially altered. No penalties will 
be assessed for failure to maintain reserves at the reserve city 
levels since acquisition of the mortgage company. 
It would be appreciated if your Bank would advise NBW 
of the contents of this letter. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Assistant Secretary.

The Board approved on February 8, 1968, the request of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a letter from President Hayes 
dated January 23, 1968, for certain changes in personnel status of 
Mr. Frank W . Schiff, but with the understanding that the record 
would be amplified on two points: 
(a) The mutual interest of both the New York Bank and 
Mr. Schiff in his eventual return to the staff of 
the New York Bank; and 
(b) The approximate level of compensation to which he 
might have been raised had he not been away from 
the Bank on leave since 1964. 
In furtherance of this Board interest, Governor Mitchell 
and I called President Hayes of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
on February 8. President Hayes indicated to the satisfaction of both 
Governor Mitchell and myself that the expected return of Mr. Schiff 
to the New York Bank staff had been an integral part of the discussions 
and planning 
that had proceeded between New York Bank representatives 
and Mr. Schiff. The Bank was very interested in having Mr. Schiff 
return to its employ following the conclusion of his service as 
Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury (a post to which he is to be 
shortly appointed), and Mr. Schiff had repeatedly declared his 
interest in returning, all subject, of course, to a negotiation of 
mutually satisfactory arrangements for his title, responsibilities, 
and salary at such future time. 
Mr. Treiber, in a telephone conversation with me on 
February 9, affirmed the belief of the Bank management that Mr. Schiff
1
s 
salary would probably have been increased over the years up to a level 
in the neighborhood of $28,000 (the salary level proposed for him in 
the New York Bank letter of January 23) had he remained in the full-time 
employ of the Bank since 1964 and demonstrated performance and acquired 
experience equivalent to that stemming from his assignments while on 
leave. 
With these two points clarified, I informed Mr. Treiber 
orally that the Board had approved the New York Bank request for 
Mr. Schiff and an appropriate confirming letter would be forthcoming.
