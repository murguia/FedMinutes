Inquiry from First National City Bank (Item No. 18). First 
National City Bank, New York, New York, had requested confirmation 
that under the Board's Regulation M, Foreign Activities of National 
Banks, it would be appropriate for its branch in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 
to invest in less than one per cent of the capital stock of Servicos 
e Assessoria, S.A., a "credit information clearing house" being 
organized by the Bank Association of the State of Sao Paulo. 
The pertinent section of Regulation M provides that a 
foreign branch, when usual in the banking business abroad, may invest 
UP to one per cent of its deposits in the securities (including stock) 
"of the central bank, clearing houses, governmental entities, and 
development banks of the country in which it is located . . . " 
The 
New York Reserve Bank's Legal Department had concluded that it would 
be reasonable to interpret the term "clearing house" in the regulation 
to include an organization engaged in the distribution of credit 
information. 
In a memorandum of December 17, 1968, the Board's Legal Divi-
sion expressed the view that since supplying credit information would

not seem to be either an objectionable or altogether unusual function 
for a clearing house to perform, the Board would seem warranted in 
interpreting "clearing house" to include a credit information clearing 
house of the type here involved. A draft letter attached would state 
that the Board concurred in First National City Bank's conclusion that 
such an acquisition of the stock of Servicos e Assessoria would be 
permissible under the regulation. 
Mr. Doyle said it had now been suggested that, rather than 
express concurrence that the acquisition would be permissible under 
the regulation, it might be well to state that on the particular facts 
°f this case the Board would not object. 
Mr. Shay commented that by statute the Board had authority to 
permit foreign branches to engage in particular operations. Although 
he believed that most of the Board's legal staff regarded the term in 
the regulation as contemplating a typical clearing house operation, 
c^edit information had some function relevant to banking and therefore 
^-t seemed that it would be appropriate to give a generous meaning to 
the term. If the Board did not want to expand the meaning to cover 
the situation presented, perhaps it would be advisable to amend the 
regulation. 
Mr. Hexter noted that the categories listed in the regulation 
Were fairly narrow. If, as apparently intended, "clearing house" was 
given its usual meaning, that might not include the function to be 

* r'Otfl

performed by the Brazilian organization. While he did not believe the 
Board should take an adverse position in the present case, he questioned 
the desirability of expanding the accepted meaning without further 
study. 
After some discussion of the functions performed by clearing 
houses in this country at the present time, members of the Board indi-
cated that they preferred the revised language Mr. Doyle had suggested. 
Accordingly, the letter was approved unanimously in the form attached 
as Item No. 18. 
All members of the staff then withdrew except Messrs. Kenyon, 
Brill, Solomon, Hexter, Johnson, Kakalec, and O'Connell, and Mrs. Semia. 
Budget of the Board of Governors (Items 19 and 20). The Board 
had referred its proposed 1969 budget to Governor Sherrill for further 
review and revision on the basis of (a) eliminating all expenditures 
that were deferrable or uncertain, (b) searching for potential addi-
tional efficiencies and economies, and (c) curtailing all expenditures 
n°t in accord with a spirit of austerity in outlays. 
Governor Sherrill had now furnished the members of the Board a 
Memorandum stating that, on the basis of his review of possible revi-
sions with each division head, he recommended reductions of $1,619,760 
in the operating budget and $638,997 in the construction budget, the 
respective total budgets as thus revised being $14,084,237 and 
500,000. The revised operating budget would be about 10 per cent 

4530 
12/27/68 
-7-
more than estimated 1968 operating expenses. Attached were tables 
summarizing the proposed reductions by object of expenditure and by-
divisions . 
In commenting on the reductions, Governor Sherrill pointed 
out that a substantial amount represented hard cuts, but accomplish-
ment of the remainder would depend upon circumstances. For example, 
the earlier budget had included provision for a general pay increase 
in conformity with the third stage of the Government-wide pay action 
adopted in 1967. The revised budget eliminated that item because of 
the possibility that the increase might be postponed or otherwise 
revised. Also, a provision for cost-of-living increases in retirement 
allowances had been eliminated because the cost-of-living index had 
not yet risen to the point where such increases would come into effect. 
Governor Brimmer questioned whether it was reasonable to assume 
that the general pay increase would not be granted, and Governor 
Sherrill replied that it could not be assumed either that the increase 
would or would not be effected. However, since other agencies were 
not including this item specifically in their budgets at the present 
time, it seemed appropriate for the Board to follow the same procedure. 
Governor Brimmer commented that if it should develop that the pay 
increase was granted the necessity to adjust the Board's budget might 
give an impression of short-sightedness, which could prove embarrassing. 

4531 
12/27/68

There ensued a discussion of the current uncertainties relating 
to the proposed pay increase, including its size, and of the possible 
increases in the salary scale for Government executives. 
Governor Brimmer then commented that the Board had always 
deplored "gimmickry" in budget-making, and he disliked to see it follow 
a course with 
respect to its own budget that might be regarded as having 
such characteristics. Governor Robertson suggested that the problem 
might be resolved by including a footnote to explain why allowance for 
the proposed pay increase had not been included in the budget. Gover-
nor Brimmer agreed that such a footnote should be included in the 
material supplied to the Bureau of the Budget for inclusion in the 
annex to the Federal budget. 
The Board's budget was then approved unanimously, with the 
understanding that a footnote such as had been suggested would be 
incorporated. Attached as Items 19 and 20 are tables showing a sum-
mary of the approved budget by divisions and by account classifications. 
The meeting then adjourned.
