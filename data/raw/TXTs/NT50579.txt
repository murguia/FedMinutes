Government securities market, bank credit, and foreign exchange develop-
ments.

Manager of the System Open Market Account in implementation of the current 
economic policy directive adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee 
last Tuesday, February 10. 
During the discussion reference was made to evidences of increased 
interest on the part of the general public in Treasury bills, and it was 
reported that the Treasury continued to have under consideration the 
Possibility of restricting bids to a minimum amount. 
It was stated that 
a memorandum from the staff on this matter would be forthcoming. 
In 
Response to a question, some members of the Board indicated that at this 
stage they would have reservations about whether such a move on the part 
°f the Treasury would on balance be desirable. 
It was felt that the 
Public should be given adequate information about the procedures involved 
in investing in bills, since in some circumstances transaction costs 
^ight make such an investment less attractive than would be assumed from 
standpoint of net return. 
In response to another question, it was stated that System and 
Treasury representatives had been moving to extend the book entry
