Participate.

Brokered deposits. From time to time the Board had received 
letters requesting information regarding nonbanking organizations that 
offered Federally-insured banks' certificates of deposit at yields 
in excess of the rate the issuing bank might lawfully pay. In May 1969 
Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency had 
inquired about such a practice on the part of The B. C. Morton Organi-
zation (subsequently known as Seaboard Planning Corporation), which 
advertised the availability of insured bank savings certificates of 
deposit to yield up to 7 per cent a year (the maximum rate payable by 
banks being 5 per cent). The Board had replied to Chairman Sparkman 
principally in terms of explanation, namely, that a money broker such 
as Seaboard Planning Corporation arranges for funds to be deposited 
In a bank at the maximum permissible rate, in order to induce the 
bank to extend credit to a specified borrower. The borrower pays the 
broker a fee for his services and a portion of that fee is passed on 
to the depositor, who thereby obtains a yield in excess of the maximum 

10/3/69 
-6-
permissible rate that the bank may pay on the deposit. The reply 
had noted that the source of the payment above the interest rate 
ceiling was the borrower from the bank rather than the bank itself. 
Chairman Sparkman had then inquired whether Regulation Q, 
Interest on Deposits, was being effectively circumvented and whether 
it should be amended to cover this situation. Congressman Hanna had 
also written with respect to similar practices by another organization 
and had asked for suggestions for closing this loophole. 
In a memorandum dated October 1, 1969, the Legal Division noted 
that the matter of deposits obtained through a broker had been under 
consideration by the Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
for a number of years. The views of the Board's Legal Division on this 
question differed from those of the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
and the staff of the FDIC. The memorandum described the actions the 
FDIC and the Board had taken relating to brokered deposits and discussed 
the legal authority of the Board in the matter and possible legislation 
to regulate such deposits. 
The Legal Division's memorandum also brought out that in June 
1969 the Board, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the FDIC, at the 
urging of the latter, had added to their interest rate regulations a 
provision that no person "shall advertise a percentage yield on any 
deposit it solicits for a member bank that is not authorized to be paid 

3043 
10/3/69 
-7-
and advertised by such bank." Despite that provision, Seaboard 
Planning Corporation had not modified the manner in which it advertised 
Federally-insured deposits. 
The memorandum stated the Legal Division's view that the only 
demonstrable need for legislation in the area of brokered deposits was 
to clarify the Board's authority with respect to the provision in its 
Regulation Q applying to brokers the rules governing member bank adver-
tising of interest on deposits and to provide a suitable penalty for 
violations of that provision. The Division considered any other legis-
lation in this area unnecessary from the standpoint of the purposes of 
rate control and undesirable as a matter of policy; it did not favor 
legislation restraining any business activity unless it caused or threatened 
a significant evil. There did not appear to be any such evil in a borrower 
paying a broker a fee for arranging that funds would be deposited in a 
member bank unaffiliated with the borrower, the broker passing a portion 
of such fee on to the depositor, or the depositor, receiving such fee 
as additional compensation for the use of his funds by the member bank. 
The Division recommended limiting the response to Senator Sparkman and 
Congressman Hanna to an expression of such view. A draft letter in those 
terms was attached. 
In a memorandum dated October 1, 1969, Mr. Solomon stated that 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation believed that the arrangements 

3044 
10/3/69 
-8-
involved in brokered deposits should be held to violate Regulation Q. 
The only real purpose was to escape the Regulation Q interest rate 
ceilings . If a bank contended that it charged the same rate on "linked" 
loans as on other loans, it was disregarding the significant fact that 
the linked loan probably involved higher risks (and therefore normally 
a higher rate) than the bank's other loans. 
Discussion at today's meeting included comments by Mr. Solomon 
to supplement his memorandum. 
Members of the Board expressed views against adopting the position 
suggested by the Legal Division. One member observed that the use of 
brokered deposits seemed to be growing, and if the Board did not have 
power to control the practice, it should be asking for remedial legisla-
tion. A comment was made that the position advocated by the Legal Division 
would vitiate the effort being made by the FDIC to reach the problem 
through the advertising provision of the interest rate regulations. There 
was agreement with a suggestion that it would be appropriate to withhold 
a request for legislation until there had been an opportunity to see what 
could be accomplished through enforcement of the new provision regarding 
advertising. 
At the conclusion of the discussion there was unanimous agreement 
that the question whether brokered deposits involve violation of Regu-
lation Q be tabled, and that the letters to Senator Sparkman and Congressman 
Hanna be transmitted after revision to reflect elements of today's discussion,

All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Molony, and 
Hexter withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
Memorial to Senator Owen. Chairman Martin reported on his 
communications with former Senator Monroney of Oklahoma concerning 
the question of Board participation in the commemoration of the role 
played by the late Senator Robert Latham Owen in the establishment of 
the Federal Reserve System. Senator Monroney and Mr. W. W. Keeler, 
Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, had suggested that the Board 
might want to consider purchasing and donating one or two commemorative 
plaques, one of which might be placed in the Cherokee National Court 
House in Oklahoma and the other at the grave of Senator Owen in Lynchburg, 
Virginia. 
After discussion the Board approved this proposal, with the 
further understanding that a member of the Board might participate in 
the commemorative ceremony that was being planned. 
Foreign travel. Upon recommendation by Governor Sherrill, the 
Board approved travel by Helen B. Junz, Senior Economist, Division of 
International Finance, to Paris, France,in mid-October 1969 in connection 
with a meeting of the OECD Working Group on Short-term Economic Prospects.

Chalrmanship at Boston Bank. Chairman Martin reported to the 
Board the prospective resignation of Mr. Howard W. Johnson as Chairman 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and there was a preliminary 
discussion of persons who might be considered to replace Mr. Johnson. 
The meeting then adjourned.

The Honorable John Sparkm&n, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
United States Senate, 
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This refers to your letter of May 29, 1969, requesting 
my views as to whether Regulation Q should be amended in view of 
the practices of such organizations as Seaboard Planning Corpora-
tion (formerly B. C. Morton Organization) by which a depositor in 
a member bank receives a total return on his funds that exceeds 
the rate the bank may lawfully pay and actually does pay. 
Under the practice, as I pointed out in my letter of 
May 14, 19b<>, Seaboard Planning Corporation - a money broker -
arranges for funds to be deposited in a bank, at the maximum per-
missible rate, in order to induce the bank to extend credit to a 
specified borrower. The borrower pays the broker a fee for his 
services anc' a portion of that fee is passed on to the depositor, 
who thereby obtains a yield in excess of the maximum permissible 
rate that the bank may pay on the deposit. 
This practice, sometimes described as "link financing",, 
has been undar consideration by both the Board and the Federal 
deposit Insurance Corporation for some years. In June of this 
year, the Board joined with the FDIC and the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board in implementing the authority granted by the Congress 
in the Act of September 21, 1968 (P. L. 90-505) to prescribe rules 
governing the "advertising of interest on deposits". This was 
accomplished by adding a new section to the interest rate regula-
tions, effective August 1. Included is a provision under which, 
so far as member banks are concerned, no person "shall advertise 
a percentage yield on any deposit it solicits for a member bank 
that is not authorized to be paid and advertised by such bank". 
(Regulation Q, Â§ 217.6(g).)

This provision reflects the Board's judgment that the 
public might be confused by a money broker advertising that "we 
have and are offering a limited supply of insured bank savings 
certificates of deposit discounted to yield up to 7% a year when 
held to maturity in units of $5,000", when the maximum rate an 
insured bank may pay on such a deposit is 5 per cent. 
We have observed that such advertisements continue to 
appear despite the change in the rules governing advertising of 
interest on insured bank deposits. In view of this and of your 
concern with the practice of banks obtaining deposits through 
brokers, our staff has reexamined the entire matter, which has 
regrettably delayed our response to your inquiry. Based upon this 
examination, tne Board believes that at this time we should direct 
our efforts in this area toward assuring compliance with the regu-
latory provision governing advertising of interest on deposits. 
If we are unsuccessful in this effort, we will consider further 
whether other measures should be taken to control member bank 
participation in link financing arrangements. 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Hanna: 
This refers to your letter of August 6, 1969, requesting 
my views as to whether the rules governing interest on deposits 
should be irodified in view of the practices of such organizations 
as Nationwide Securities Corporation by which a depositor in a 
member bank receives a total return on his funds that exceeds the 
rate the bank may lawfully pay and actually does pay. 
Under the practice, as you'point out in your letter. 
Nationwide Securities Corporation - a money broker - arranges for 
funds to be deposited in a bank, at the maximum permissible rate, 
in order to induce the bank to extend credit to a specified bor-
rower. The borrower pays the broker a fee for his services and 
a portion oÂ£ that fee is passed on to the depositor, who thereby 
obtains a yield in excess of the maximum permissible rate that 
the bank may pay on the deposit. 
This practice, sometimes described as "link financing", 
has been under consideration by both the Board and the Federal 
Deposit Insvirance Corporation for some years. In June of this 
year, the Board joined with the FDIC and the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board :.n implementing the authority granted by the Congress

This provision reflects the Board's judgment that the 
public might be confused by a money broker advertising that "we are 
offering a limited supply of FDIC member bank savings certificates 
of deposit discounted to yield up to 7% per annum", in specified 
amounts less than $100,000, when the maximum rate an insured bank 
may pay on such a deposit is 5 per cent. 
We have observed that such advertisements continue to 
appear despite the change in the rules governing advertising of 
interest on insured bank deposits. In view of this and of your 
apparent concern with the practice of banks obtaining deposits 
through brokers, our staff has reexamined the entire matter, which 
has regrettably delayed our response to your inquiry. Based upon
