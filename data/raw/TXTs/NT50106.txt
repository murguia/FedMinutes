Approved items. The following items were approved unanimously 
after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the Board. Copies are attached under the respective numbers 
indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to The Provident Bank, Cincinnati, Ohio, 
1 
granting an extension of time within which to 
establish a branch in Colerain Township, 
Hamilton County. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 
2 
approving a revision of the Bank's salary struc-
ture applicable to employees.

In connection with Item No. 2, Governor Brimmer expressed the 
view that the proposed revision would meet the new criteria adopted by 
the Board on June 23, 1967, whereby revised salary ranges would be 
based upon midpoints at estimated market levels at the date the struc-
ture was to become effective, but without any additional allowance for 
increases in market beyond that date. He noted that the proposed 
structure would reflect a slight "lead" (1.1 per cent) at the Charlotte 
Branch, but it seemed to him that the main thrust should be at the head 
office and in this instance the Richmond office would be in line. 
Accordingly, he concurred in the Personnel Division's favorable recom-
mendation. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller of 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger 
of The First National Bank of Three Springs, Three Springs, Pennsylvania, 
into Union National Bank and Trust Company of Huntingdon, Huntingdon, 
Pennsylvania, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptrol-
ler. The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of Union National 
Bank and Trust Company of Huntingdon and First National 
Bank of Three Springs would eliminate a small amount of 
competition which exists between them. Overall, the effect 
of the proposal on competition would be slightly adverse. 
Question regarding S. 1298 (Item No. 3). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum from Mr. Cardon dated June 30, 1967, relating to 
a question raised by the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks 

269:1 
7/5/67 
-3-
as to whether mutual savings banks would be covered under the provisions 
of S. 1298, a bill proposed by the Board relating to a graduated system 
of reserve requirements. The memorandum summarized the circumstances 
under which certain nonmember mutual savings banks would be covered by 
S. 1298 and commented upon possible amendments that would remove those 
banks from the scope of the legislation. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter to the Asso-
ciation that would indicate that it was not the intention of the Board 
to apply reserve requirements to nonmember mutual savings banks. The 
letter would further state that in order to clarify the point, the 
Board was prepared to offer certain amendments to the bill when called 
upon to testify before the appropriate Congressional Committees. 
After summary comments by Mr. Cardon, Governor Robertson 
observed that apparently a few mutual savings banks were inadvertently 
covered by the bill. He felt that if any mutual savings banks were to 
be affected, consideration should be given to extending the law to 
cover all such banks. In the present circumstances, he agreed with 
the position taken in the proposed letter. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the letter to the National 
Association of Mutual Savings Banks, a copy of which is attached as 
Item No. 3. 
Messrs. Johnson, Koch, Egertson, Hart, and Wood then withdrew 
and Messrs. Holland, Adviser to the Board, and Solomon, Adviser to the

Board and Director, Division of International Finance, entered the 
meeting. 
Public Information Act. At the request of Chairman Martin, 
Mr. Hackley reviewed efforts to obtain an executive order that would 
exempt certain Treasury and Federal Reserve records from the provisions 
of the Public Information Act. A letter dated June 19, 1967, signed 
by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Vice Chairman of the Board 
had been sent to the Bureau of the Budget setting forth reasons why 
untimely disclosure of official foreign exchange operations might be 
prejudicial to the interest of the United States. The letter also 
submitted a draft of executive order that would in effect safeguard 
such monetary and fiscal information. 
Mr. Hackley said that ind ications were that the Bureau of the 
Budget was not disposed to sponsor the suggested executive order and 
that the Department of Justice was apparently reluctant to support any 
further exemptions from the Act. Consequently, the Secretary of the 
Treasury now proposed to make a plea direct to the President. The 
Treasury had drafted a shorter version of an executive order, for sub-
mission by the Secretary to the President, together with copies of the 
June 19, 1967, letter to the Bureau of the Budget and its supporting 
papers. The alternative draft order appeared satisfactory to Mr. 
Hackley. He and Mr. Solomon had reviewed the proposed memorandum of 
transmittal and had only a few editorial changes to suggest. 

7/5/67 
-5-
During discussion no objection was expressed with respect to 
the procedure suggested by the Treasury, but question was raised 
whether the proposed executive order had been reviewed by the Director 
of the Bureau of the Budget or only by the Bureau's staff and it was 
understood that Mr. Hackley would endeavor to ascertain whether a firm 
position had been taken by the Bureau regarding the matter. 
Call for condition reports. Pursuant to established proce-
dures, the close of business Friday, June 30, 1967, had been selected 
as the date for the second call for reports of condition to be made by 
insured banks within the calendar year 1967. The call was to be 
announced at 9:00 a.m., Thursday, July 6. 
The Secretary reported that in accordance with the usual prac-
tice a telegram had been sent to the Federal Reserve Banks on July 3, 
1967, advising that a call for reports of condition by State member 
banks as of the close of business June 30 should be made at a specified 
time on forms furnished with the Board's letter of June 16, 1967. 
The sending of the telegram was ratified unanimously. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: On July 3, 1967, a letter 
was sent to The Chase Manhattan Bank (National 
Association), New York, New York, acknowledging 
receipt of notice of its intent to establish an 
additional branch in the Virgin Islands, to be 
located in the King Christian Hotel, Christian-
sted, St. Croix.

Actions under delegated authority. On June 5, 1967, effective

Mr. Grover W. Ens ley, 
Executive Vice President, 
National Association of 
Mutual Savings Banks, 
200 Park Avenue, 
New York, New York.

Dear Grover: 
This is in reply to your letter of April 28, 1967, regarding 
S. 1298, which would provide for a system of graduated reserve require-
ments for demand deposits applicable to all insured commercial banks. 
You are quite right in assuming that the Board did not intend, 
in recommending introduction of this legislation, to apply reserve 
requirements to nonmember mutual savings banks. In order to make it 
clear that such banks would not be subject to reserve requirements, the 
Board believes that the definition beginning in line 6 of the first page 
of S 1298 should be amended to read as follows: "For purposes of this 
section the term 'insured bank1 means any bank, other than a nonmember 
savings'bank, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation." 
Two conforming amendments would be required. The first 
would strike the words "engaged in the business of receiving deposits 
subject to check" in lines 3 and 4 of page 2 of the bill, thereby 
continuing existing provisions that apply reserve requirements to 
any savings bank that becomes a member of the System. The tmal 
amendment would add after "district" on page 4, line 19, the words 
"the deposits of which are subject to the provisions of this Act 
regarding required reserves"; this would mean that the provisions 
of the bill that now permit insured nonmember banks to borrow from 
Reserve Banks on the same basis as member banks would be limited to 
those nonmember banks that are subject to reserve requirements. 
A recommendation that such amendments be adopted will be 
included in any testimony the Board may present on this legislation. 
Sincerely yours 
Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.
