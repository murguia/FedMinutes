Adoption of Form F-10 and amendment to Regulation F (Item No. 8). 
On March 14, 1967, the Board authorized publication in the Federal Reg-
ister for comment of a proposed new form, to be designated Form F-10, 
for registration of additional classes of securities by banks with stock 
already registered pursuant to Regulation F (Securities of Member State 
Banks). No comments had been received except from Federal Reserve Banks, 
ar*d none of their comments were adverse.

The Legal Division, in a memorandum dated April 18, 1967, 
recommended adoption of Form F-10 essentially in the form published 
for comment except for the incorporation of a few clarifying changes. 
The Division also recommended an amendment to section 206.4(a) of 
Regulation F, this being necessitated by the adoption of Form F-10. 
The proposed Form F-10 was adopted, and unanimous approval was 
given to the recommended amendment to Regulation F, effective immedi-
ately. A copy of the notice sent to the Federal Register concerning 
this action is attached as Item No. 8. 
Designation of representatives of CPA firms as special assistant 
examiners. In a letter dated March 28, 1967, President Galusha of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis suggested that cooperation and 
understanding between bank supervisors and certified public accountant 
firms might be strengthened by a reciprocal training arrangement under 
which Federal Reserve Bank examiners would participate in audits by such 
firms while representatives of those firms would assist in examinations 
of State member banks. 
President Galusha asked, first, whether Board authorization was 
required for a CPA firm representative to take part in an examination 
°f a State member bank. As noted in a memorandum from the Division of 
Examinations and the Legal Division dated April 11, 1967, the answer 
to that question was in the affirmative because of the statement in 
Paragraph 7 of section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act that "As a condition 

1.49? 
4/20/67 
-8-
of membership such banks shall likewise be subject to examinations made 
by . . . examiners selected or approved by the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System." 
President Galusha's next question was whether, if such authori-
zation was required, the Board would be willing to approve the appoint-
ment of CPA firm representatives as special assistant examiners for 
participation in examinations of State member banks. 
The memorandum 
pointed out that in no outstanding Board letters was mention made of 
the appointment of special assistant examiners who were not full-time 
employees of a Reserve Bank. 
Also, a State member bank might not want 
a representative of a CPA firm to participate in an examination of the 
bank, and more specifically it might not want a representative of a 
Particular firm. 
It was noted that any such persons selected would 
have access to highly confidential information. 
The memorandum also pointed out that the effect of certain 
applicable criminal provisions should be considered, including sec-
tions 212 and 213 of the Criminal Code, which deal with loans or gratu-
ities to bank examiners, and section 1906, which prohibits examiners 
from revealing the names of borrowers or collateral for loans. 
Refer-
ence also was made to certain provisions of section 1909 of the Criminal 
Code. 
Submitted with the memorandum was a draft of reply to President 
Galusha taking the position that the Board would not approve requests 

1.49? 
4/20/67 
-8-
for appointment of representatives of CPA firms as special assistant 
examiners. 
Governor Shepardson said that, while he had sympathy with Pres-
ident Galusha's objective, he was inclined to feel that the suggested 
arrangement would present substantial problems. If a CPA firm repre-
sentative would actually transfer his employment to a Reserve Bank for 
a period of time, that might overcome some of the objections, but he 
doubted whether CPA firms and their representatives would react favor-
ably. Absent some arrangement of that kind, he felt that the staff 
probably was correct in its position that the proposal should not be 
approved. 
Governor Daane expressed himself as somewhat reluctant to 
approve such an arrangement but at the same time reluctant to reject 
President Galusha's proposal completely, especially since it had been 
submitted as a proposition that would be beneficial both to the Federal 
Reserve and the banking system. He was not impressed by the reference 
in the memorandum to the fact that outstanding Board letters made no 
reference to the appointment of special assistant examiners who were 
not full-time employees of a Reserve Bank. That seemed to reflect a 
negative attitude without giving the matter full study. On balance, 
h e would prefer to have the proposal studied further, with an open 
mind, to determine whether the problems that had been cited could be 
°vercome and whether the proposal could be worked out on some adjusted 
basis. 

1.49? 
4/20/67

Governor Maisel suggested that the answer to some of the ques-
tions that had been raised seemed to depend on whether a State member 
bank being examined would or would not be agreeable to the inclusion 
of a CPA firm representative in the group of Reserve Bank examiners 
making the examination. If a State member bank's attitude was positive, 
he felt that the proposal might be workable. 
In response to a question from Chairman Martin, Mr. Leavitt 
said that although he had talked with Vice President Grobel he had not 
discussed the proposal with President Galusha. 
Chairman Martin then commented that President Galusha was him-
self a certified public accountant and therefore might bring to the 
consideration of the matter a fresh point of view as far as the System 
was concerned. He agreed with a remark by Governor Maisel that it would 
seem appropriate to send President Galusha a copy of the April 11 memo-
randum, with the suggestion that at some convenient time the Board would 
be glad to discuss the matter with him. 
It was agreed that such a procedure would be followed. 
Appointment of director at Jacksonville. After consideration 
°f suggestions presented in a memorandum from Mr. Morgan dated April 18, 
it was agreed to ascertain through the Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta whether Henry Cragg, Chairman of the Board of 
Minute Maid Company, Orlando, Florida, would accept appointment, if 
tendered, as a director of the Jacksonville Branch of the Federal 

1.49?

Reserve Bank of Atlanta for the unexpired portion (through December 31, 
1967) of the term of Douglas M. Pratt, who had resigned effective 
March 31, 1967, because he would be spending much time on business in 
another part of the country. It was understood that if it developed 
that Mr. Cragg would accept the appointment if tendered, the appointment 
would be made. 
Secretary's Note: It having been ascer-
tained that Mr. Cragg would accept the 
appointment if tendered, an appointment 
telegram was sent to him on April 21, 
1967. 
Meeting of Treasury consultants. Governor Daane reported infor-
mally on his attendance at a portion of yesterday's meeting of the 
academic consultants to the Treasury, and it was understood that a 
further report might be made by Governor Mitchell following the latter's 
return to Washington. 
International monetary reform. Governor Daane reviewed the 
offic ial" translation that had been received of the communique issued 
ky the finance ministers of the European Economic Community countries 
following their recent meeting in Munich. He also referred to the text 
a press release that had been issued by the U.S. Treasury concerning 
t*le communique and went on to describe the position proposed to be taken 
W U.S. representatives in further negotiations on the creation of an 
international reserve asset at the meetings of the Deputies of the 
Group of Ten with the Executive Directors of the International Monetary 
Fund scheduled to be held in Washington next week.

Discount collateral training program. Mr. Holland noted that he 
had sent to each member of the Board, with a memorandum dated April 19, 
1967, a copy of a telegram dated April 18, 1967, from Governor Robertson 
to the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks concerning implementation 
of the proposed System training program for the appraisal of discount 
collateral that had been mentioned by Governor Robertson at the meeting 
of the Federal Open Market Committee on April 4, 1967. In the telegram 
Governor Robertson reiterated that he considered such training important 
because the "eligible paper" bill, under which Federal Reserve Banks 
would be permitted to take any acceptable bank asset as collateral to 
member bank borrowings,might be enacted into law shortly. 
As described in the telegram, an Ad Hoc Committee headed by Vice 
President Bilby of the New York Reserve Bank had agreed to a tentative 
curriculum for a training program, suggested names of faculty members, 
an-d tentatively concluded that a training program could be conducted 
eff 
iciently within a two-week period. The Ad Hoc Committee recommended 
that the first session be held at the Board's offices beginning June 12, 
7, with each Reserve Bank asked to send two persons. 
Governor Robertson's wire noted that he and President Hayes, 
^airman of the Presidents' Conference Committee on Discounts and 
Credits, had reviewed the plans and were satisfied that the program 
Would be a constructive one. The Reserve Banks were asked to submit 
tlle names of persons selected to attend the first session of the train-
ln8 program.

Expressions by members of the Board were favorable toward the 
proposed training program. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Sherman and Kenyon then 
withdrew from the meeting. 
Travel by Mr. Zeisel. The Board authorized travel by Joseph C. 
Zeisel, Senior Economist in the Division of Research and Statistics, to 
Toronto, Canada, to attend the annual meeting of the Interstate Confer-
ence on Labor Statistics to be held the week of June 12-16, 1967. 
Leave without pay for Mr. de Leeuw. The Board authorized leave 
without pay for Frank de Leeuw, Senior Economist in the Division of 
Research and Statistics, every other Thursday and Friday from about 
September 15, 1967, through May 30, 1968, in order to permit Mr. de Leeuw 
to accept an offer to conduct a seminar on monetary economics at the State 
University of New York at Buffalo. 
This action was taken by the Board with the understanding that 
no precedent was being established for application in the case of Mr. 
de Leeuw or other members of the staff and that in the event a renewal 
°f the arrangement with respect to Mr. de Leeuw should be proposed, such 
Proposal would be brought to the Board for consideration. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: Pursuant to the require-
ment of section 10 of the Federal Reserve 
Act, the Board's Annual Report for 1966 was 
transmitted to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives on April 19, 1967. A copy 
of the report was also transmitted to the 
President of the Senate for the information 
of the Senate.

of a simplified form for registration of additional classes of securities 
of & member State bank where most of the information necessary for the 
protection of investors in securities of the bank is already publicly 
available,

form (§ 206,46) was published for comment in the Federal Register of 
March 2],, 1967 (32 F.R. 4316). NO notice was published with respect

new form. The amendments were adopted by the Board after consideration 
of all relevant material, including communications received from 
interested persons. The effective date was not deferred for the 30-day 
period referred to in section 553(d), Title 5, United States Code, 
because the amendments have the effect of alleviating the requirements 
of the general rule with respect to the form for registration of securities.

When not engaged in the performance of his duties as Federal

from the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these responsi-
bilities .

tion of the effective date of his appointment.
