Approved letters. The following letters were approved unani-
mously after consideration of background information that had been 
made available to the Board. Copies of the letters are attached under 
the respective item numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to Bank of America, New York, New York,

and that of Banca d'America e d1Italia, Milan, 
Italy, in Financial Corporation for Overseas 
Countries, Geneva, Switzerland.

enrolled bill H.R. 4765, relating to tax 
treatment of certain distributions pursuant 
t o the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as 
amended. 
Application of International Bank of Detroit. There had been 
distributed a memorandum dated December 12, 1967, from the Division of 
Examinations regarding the application of International Bank of Detroit 
Detroit, Michigan (a section 25(a) corporation), for permission to 
amend its articles of association to increase its capital stock from 
Ut£v 
800,000 to $14,400,000. 
Governor Maisel called attention to a statement in the memoran-
that the applicant corporation, in combination with other Edge 

. 4851 
12/18/67 
-3-
corporations and a foreign bank, was in process of forming a bank to 
be domiciled in London, England, that would engage in medium-term 
financing. Since the proposed increase in capital stock was appar-
ently a move preparatory to the establishment of the new foreign bank, 
Governor Maisel wondered whether consideration had been given to the 
Propriety from the standpoint of the antitrust laws for the organizing 
group to establish the proposed London subsidiary. 
After discussion, action on the present application was 
Referred pending exploration of the point Governor Maisel had raised. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation on the competitive factors involved in the pro-
Posed assumption of a portion of the liabilities of The Title Guarantee 
Company, New York, New York, by Kings County Lafayette Trust Company, 
Brooklyn, New York, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Corporation. The conclusion stated that the proposal would have no 
adverse effect on competition. 
Examiners conference (Item No. 4). There had been distributed 
a Memorandum dated December 13, 1967, from the Division of Examina-
tions regarding the possible rescheduling of a conference of represen-
tatives of the Bank Examinations Departments of the Federal Reserve 
^anks. on October 26, 1967, the Board had approved the holding of 
S U ch a conference at the Board's offices in January 1968, with a dinner 
to ^e given for Reserve Bank representatives and designated Board per-
s°nnel. The January date was selected as providing a reasonable 

4852 
12/18/67 
-4-
interval before the second 1968 examiners conference, which, according 
to custom, would be held in conjunction with the annual convention of 
the National Association of Supervisors of State Banks. The convention 
w as then expected to be held in St. Louis in mid-June, but the Associa-
tion had now rescheduled it for early April and would hold it in Hawaii. 
The Division suggested as alternatives (1) that the January 
feting be held as scheduled, in which case there would seem little 
need for a meeting in Hawaii only 2-1/2 months later; or (2) that the 
January meeting be cancelled and a meeting held in Hawaii in connection 
with the Association s convention. 
The memorandum mentioned considera-
tions in favor of and against attendance by Federal Reserve representa-
tives at the Hawaii conference, the principal adverse consideration 
being transportation cost. 
It was brought out that most of the Reserve 
Banks were usually represented by more than one person at the Associa-
tion's conventions. However, when one such conference had been held in 
Puerto Rico, the Board had indicated that only one person from each 
Reserve Bank should attend. 
Governor Robertson suggested that the January meeting be can-
) 
Celled and that each Reserve Bank and the Board send one representative 
to the conference in Hawaii. Thus, evidence would be given of coopera-
tion with the State bank supervisors, but expense would be held down. 
\ 
Governor Brimmer wondered whether, since Hawaii was one of the 
« 
States, the Board should reduce participation simply because it was 
farther away. 

Messrs. Hexter, Egertson, Shull, Cleaver, arid Lawrence then 
withdrew from the meeting. 
Reserve Bank budgets (Item No. 5). 
In a distributed memorandum 
dated December 12, 1967, the Division of Bank Operations presented an 
is of the proposed budgets of the Federal Reserve Banks and 
^ranches for the first half of 1968. Total operating expenses were 
exPected to be $108 million, about $4.9 million more than estimated 
G*Penses for the second half of 1967, with all Banks budgeting for 
^creases. 
The largest percentage increases were at the Richmond and 
^ansas City Reserve Banks, reflecting the cost of furnishing and equip-
tW

Governor Robertson responded that, particularly in view of 
Present inflationary pressures, it would seem unnecessary to incur the 
cost of sending the usual number of System representatives to a confer-
ence being held in Hawaii, and Governor Maisel said he also was con-
cerned about the cost of holding a Federal Reserve conference at a 
site so far away from most Federal Reserve offices. 
The continuing discussion indicated general agreement with 
Participating in but reducing attendance at the Hawaii conference, 
although with some leeway for sending more than one representative if 
Board or a Reserve Bank should find strong reason for doing so. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the sending of a letter 
t o the Federal Reserve Banks in the form attached as Item No. 4. 
Ping new buildings--the Culpeper Communications and Records Center and 

4854

the Denver Branch building. The projected increase in the number of 
Reserve Bank employees was relatively negligible, but salary costs 
w^re expected to increase significantly, not only because of the 
seasonal increase in expense for retirement and other benefits, but 
also because of general, merit, and promotional salary increases. 
Another significant increase in next year's expense, amounting to 
almost $200,000, was related to the increase in postal rates to be 
effective in January 1968. 
Mr. White summarized the principal aspects of the budgets, and 
stated that the Division recommended that the budgets be approved. 
In response to a question by Governor Mitchell, Mr. Farrell 
stated that the Federal Reserve Banks had consistently treated furni-
Lure and equipment items as expenses in the year purchased. 
Governor Brimmer then inquired whether it might be possible to 
restructure the budgets so as to show large capital items separately 
to facilitate comparison among the Reserve Banks, to which Mr. Farrell 
indicated that an effort could be made in that direction; in fact, the 
had been discussed over a number of years. 
In response to 
another inquiry by Governor Brimmer, Mr. Kiley indicated that the Divi-
was now working with the Reserve Banks on a planning-programming-
budgeting system.

diff iculties at certain Reserve Banks in recruiting for research posi-
tions . 
At the conclusion of the discussion the budgets were accepted. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is 
attached as Item No. 5. The letters to the other Reserve Banks were 
similar in form. 
The following then entered the room: 
Mr. Cardon, Legislative Counsel 
Mr. Partee, Associate Director, Division of 
Research and Statistics 
Mr. Sigel, Associate Adviser, Division of 
Research and Statistics 
Mr. Sammons, Associate Director, Division 
of International Finance 
Data processing operations. There had been distributed a memo-
randum dated December 11, 1967, from Mr. Byrne reviewing circumstances 
through which a backlog of work had developed in the Division of Data 
Processing. After commenting upon the principal areas of concern, Mr. 
Byrne recommended that a short-term operational plan be put into effect 
immediately as a means of dealing with the problem. The short-term 
would include the following modifications in the Division's over-
a H program: 
1. Suspend advance planning for the next five months. This 
would, of course, result in a slippage in the scheduling 
for the Board-Culpeper system; however, the later schedul-
ing would be more consistent with future capabilities to 
implement the system successfully and to profit from the 
experience of others in the development of similar third-
generation systems. The proposed scheduling for the 
Culpeper operation would then be as follows: 

' 4856

-8-
May 1, 1968 
Resume advance planning 
July 1, 1968 Place order for Culpeper computer system 
July 1, 1969 Install Culpeper system 
2. Modify the organizational structure of the Division of 
Data Processing for a period of five months. This tem-
porary measure would be designed to focus all Division 
capability on the immediate, short-range effort. At 
the end of the five-month period, measures could be 
taken to revise the organizational structure so as to 
resume long-range planning and implementation. 
3. Institute a planning, programming, and budgeting concept 
in 1968. Efforts had already been started in this direc-
tion by the Computer Uses and Procedures Committee; project 
review and initial estimation of required data processing 
resources were under way. The results of this planning 
and estimating should provide the basis for a more thorough 
definition of the 1968 data processing program and lend 
additional direction, objective, and scope to that pro-
gram as applied to the using division's needs. 
4. Concentrate for the five-month period on the following 
basic problems: 
(a) improving data management; (b) improv-
ing control mechanism; (c) clearing up backlog of System 
360 conversion; and (d) improving user knowledge of System 
360 procedures. 
Mr. Byrne's comments indicated that the temporary plan was 
signed to permit a better focus on current operating problems and to 
c^ean up the backlog of work. He also felt that it would enable the 
! 
• i' 
•" 
' 
division to increase its training and educational programs for all 
users. 
During the ensuing discussion, Governor Sherrill expressed the 
V*Gw> in which Governor Mitchell concurred, that the proposed opera-
ti 
n al plan outlined by Mr. Byrne would offer an excellent short-term 
^r°gram, and he recommended its adoption. 
de 
The recommendations were then approved unanimously.

Board budget for 1968 (Items 6 and 7). There had been dis-
tributed to the Board with a covering memorandum from the Office of 
the Controller dated December 11, 1967, a proposed Board budget for 
the calendar year 1968 in the total amount of $13,159,000. The pro-
Posed budget was about $2,189,000 (20 per cent) higher than estimated 
1967 expenses. The budget did not include a provision for a general 
pay increase such as would be given Federal employees under pending 
legis lation, passage of which appeared imminent at the time the Con-
troller's memorandum was prepared. However, there was attached to the 
Memorandum a general pay increase budget totaling $515,000 that would 
ke allocated to the various division budgets, assuming that the perti-
nent legislation was enacted and the Board authorized a similar increase 
its employees. 
Secretary's Note: The pertinent legislation was 
signed by the President on December 16, 1967. 
The memorandum from the Controller brought out that in the 
•Mil-' . 
Personal services budget, increases of $840,000 in salaries and fees 
Were partially offset by a decrease of $219,000 in retirement contri-
butions and employee insurance. The decrease reflected primarily 
^ i i 
. 
, 
. . . 
n°nrecurrence of a 1967 special payment to the Retirement System to 
^und supplementary benefits to Board Plan annuitants. The increase of 
^13,000 in budgeted salaries was attributable primarily to continued 
•j^us a J 
,..., 
.. 
.... 
staff 
£ r expansion, costs of filling positions that were vacant during 
an 0 r part of 1967, normal prospective salary adjustments, and pay 

12/18/67 
-10-
above a 52-week base in 1968. The two largest increases in salary 
budgets for individual divisions were for the Division of Data Process-
ing, which was up $252,000 (31 per cent of the total), and the Division 
of Research and Statistics, which was up $231,500 (29 per cent of the 
total). The memorandum included explanatory comments regarding these 
increases. 
The increase in nonpersonal services reflected, among other 
things, outside contracts for data processing, including continued ser-
vices to implement new program systems required for the IBM 360 system; 
architects' fees and other expenses incident to the proposed annex 
building across "C" Street; data processing equipment rentals; increases 
in the amount of and rentals for outside office space; elevator modern-
ization in the Board's present building; increased expense for postage 
and expressage arising from revised procedures of the Post Office 
Department and postal rate increases provided in pending legislation; 
ad<Utional travel expense, principally for Board-approved travel by 
Members of the field examining staff to their homes on weekends; pro-
vision for certain items of furniture and equipment mentioned in the 
Memorandum; and an increase in fees payable to consultants and hearing 
examiners. 
After introductory comments by Mr. Kakalec, Governors Mitchell, 
k.* i 
Maisel, and Brimmer directed a series of questions to the Divisions of 
Re search and Statistics and International Finance regarding the absence 

• 4859 
12/18/67 
-11-
from the Division budgets of performance cost data for particular 
Projects. The discussion brought out that it was difficult to assign 
a specific cost to a particular project because of the necessity to 
divert staff from long-range projects to day-to-day emergency assign-
ments, the need for the latter being inherent in the nature of the 
Board's responsibilities. 
Governor Mitchell urged that, without pushing the point too 
an effort be made to determine the cost of major projects under-
taken at the Board--at least for those of a magnitude of $100,000 or 
m°re. 
jn the absence of such information, the Divisions were in the 
Position of stating general objectives and asking for money to accom-
plish them, without any real data to explain how funds and staff time 
Were devoted to particular activities. 
i 
Mr. Brill's responses included comments that although the 
budget for the Division of Research and Statistics did not include 
itemized project costs, nevertheless it was known what the staff was 
d°ing and what special assignments diverted particular members from 
fcboir long-term tasks. An effort to staff adequately for emergencies 
a s well as basic programs ran into the problem of obtaining supervisory 
talent, especially middle management but also junior talent, and it 
not seemed desirable to try to anticipate emergencies by providing 
all 
needed personnel for such projects without diverting staff from 
re8ular" assignments. 

. 4860 
12/18/67 
-12-
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it could be misleading 
to attempt to present individually distinct projects since the work of 
the Research Division was not by nature discrete. The need for staff 
flexibility, in order to handle emergent priorities as well as long-
range research, made it difficult to separate the cost of each under-
taking. An example of conflicting objectives might be found in the 
Banking Markets Section, which served not only for major analysis pro-
grams but also for studies of specific areas germane to the Board's 
decisions regarding particular applications. He had found their con-
tribution in the latter capacity helpful. 
Governor Maisel said he had a less strong feeling about the 
need for specific allocation of manpower and money regarding the Divi-
sion of Research and Statistics than he did regarding the Division of 
International Finance; he believed the use made of the resources of the 
latter Division might not be as logical as desirable. It was true that 
If a budget was supposed to serve as a management tool and a guide for 
Setting priorities, the proposed budget for research did not accomplish 
that purpose, and there was a question whether greater effort should be 
made to get a more complete picture of where the resources were going. 
As the discussion continued, Governor Mitchell asked Messrs. 
B r i U and Solomon to appraise their Divisions in terms of whether they 
Were badly understaffed, understaffed, adequately staffed, overstaffed, 
°r badly overstaffed. Mr. Brill indicated that his answer would lie 

1961 
12/18/67 
-13-
between adequately staffed and understaffed. The present number of 
vacancies was about normal, and it was expected that a few additional 
Professional staff members would be needed. Mr. Solomon expressed the 
view that the Division of International Finance was slightly under-
staffed. Other questions by Governor Mitchell, to which Messrs. Brill 
and Solomon responded, 
related to the work load of professional staff 
members and where the flex was to be found to provide staff for emer-
gencies . 
Governor Brimmer suggested that the questions that had been 
raised regarding allocation of time and funds should be addressed to 
all Divisions; for example, he would like to know about the resources 
the Division of Examinations devoted to examinations proper, bank 
holding 
company matters, merger cases, competitive factor reports, etc. 
tte also suggested that the point Mr. Brill had made regarding the need 
f°r diverting supervisory talent from regular to emergency assignments 
• 
• 
^ight be met in part by organizational changes. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the Board's budget was 
a O n 
-~t-£roved unanimously, it being understood that the several Divisions 
w°uld work toward the cost evaluations that had been suggested. 
Ath 
cached as Items 6 and 7 are tables showing a summary of the budget 
ky Divisions and by account classifications (as subsequently revised 
to reflect salary increases patterned after the Federal pay bill signed 
bV th e President on December 16, 1967). 

12/18/67

General pay increase (Item No. 8). There had been distributed 
a memorandum from the Division of Personnel Administration dated 
December 16, 1967, recommending that the Board approve a revision of 
its regular salary schedule retroactive to October 8, 1967, correspond-
to the basic compensation rates established by the Federal Salary 
Act of 1967, Public Law 90-206, which had now been signed by the Pres-
ident. A copy of the regular salary schedule, as revised in accordance 
with this recommendation, was attached to the memorandum. The Division 
also recommended that the Board approve for its staff certain increased 
insurance benefits provided by the Act, as described in the memorandum. 
The memorandum stated also that the Office of the Controller recommended 
approval of any overexpenditures in the 1967 salary and employee retire-
ment and insurance benefits budgetary accounts that might result from 
approval of changes similar to those provided in the new legislation. 
The memorandum brought out that the Act provided also for two 
t . • 
subsequent general salary increases, to be effective July 1968 and 
July 1969} to attain comparability between salaries in the Federal 
^0vernment and those paid in private industry, the private industry 
rates to be those determined by the yearly Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Survey. Among other provisions, the Act called for an increase, effec-
tive with the first pay period beginning on or after the date of enact-
ent of the Act, in the annual basic pay for Executive Schedule Level 
Positions from $28,500 to $29,500. 
(This would affect the salaries 

12/18/67 
-15-
of the members of the Board, except that of the Chairman, effective 
January 1, 1968.) 
It was recommended that, with the approval of the Board member 
having the assignment for internal administrative affairs, the Per-
sonnel Division be responsible for making adjustments in the per diem 
and hourly rates of employees serving on a when-actually-employed basis, 
and that the Office of the Controller and the Division of Personnel 
Administration use Government regulations and interpretations as guides 
in deciding questions of administration and procedure. 
The Board approved unanimously the recommendations in the memo-
randum, a copy of which is attached as Item No. 8. 
Thereupon the meeting adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: Governor Robertson 
today approved on behalf of the Board 
memoranda recommending the following 
actions relating to the Board's staff: 
Sal a gy increase 
Jane D. Price, Programmer, Division of Data Processing, from 
$6»451 to $7,696 per annum, effective December 18, 1967. 
transfer 
Betty L. Jackson, from the position of Secretary in the Division 
Personnel Administration to the position of Secretary in the Office 
the Secretary, with no change in basic annual salary at the rate of 
>683 j effective December 17, 1967. 
On December 18, 1967, action was taken 
on behalf of the Board under delegated 
authority as indicated by the following 
letter, a copy of which is attached under 
the item number indicated:

°ear Mr. Rommel: 
This is in response to your request of December 15, 1967, 
for the Board's views on enrolled bill H.R. 4765, "To amend the 
internal Revenue Code of 1954 with respect to the income tax treat-
ment of certain distributions pursuant to the Bank Holding Company 
Act of 1956, as amended, and for other purposes." The Board 
understands that a major purpose of this bill is to treat companies 
c a m e within the coverage of the Bank Holding Company Act as a 
result of the amendments thereto in 1966 (80 Stat. 236) in a manner 
comparable, insofar as tax consequences of required dispositions of 
assets are concerned, with companies that came within the coverage 
° 
t h e original Act. The Congress, in 1956, provided that, where it 
^equired disposition of previously held banking or nonbanking 
nterests, there should be no tax consequences to the shareholders 
^Pon any distributions occurring as a result of this action. This 
11 would extend the same general treatment to distributions 
required under the 1966 amendments. 
Other aspects of the bill relate to questions of Federal 
axation that are outside the area of the Board's responsibilities. 
^ e Board favors Presidential approval of H.R. 4765, unless there 
r e adverse considerations relating to such other aspects. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr

December 22, 1967 
Dear Sir: 
In the Board's letter of October 26, 1967, you were informed 
a proposed conference at which representatives of the Bank Examina-
tion Departments of Federal Reserve Banks would meet with members of 
the Board's staff on January 13 and 19, 1963. 
The conference was to 
held in the Board's offices in Washington, D. C. 
The meeting was scheduled in January in order to allow an 
interval of approximately six months between the conference and the 
annual convention of the NASSB. 
Subsequent to the Board's approval 
the meeting, however, the NASSB changed the location of its annual 
convention from St. Louis to Hawaii and the time from mid-June to 
APril 1, 1968. 
Since members of the Examination Departments of the Reserve 
Banks customarily attend the NASSB convention and hold a meeting in 
conjunction therewith, it appears little would be gained by having two 
m e etings so near together. 
Therefore; the Board has cancelled the 
January meeting, with the expectation that there will be a meeting of 
examination personnel in conjunction with the NASSB convention. 
In view of the cost involved in traveling to Hawaii the 
®°ard believes that attendance should be limited to one individual 
from the Board and from each Reserve Bank unless a clear need for 
^Presentation by additional persons is demonstrated. 
An agenda from topics already submitted will be prepared 
and sent out in advance of the Hawaii meeting. 
Should members of your 
lamination Department have additional agenda suggestions, it would be 
aPpreciated if such were submitted not later than March 1, 1968. 
Very truly yours, 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Assistant Secretary.

sion of Personnel Administration 
Date DEC 1 6 1967 
Subject: 
General Adjustment of the 
Board's Regular Salary Schedule 
1967 " 
T ° d a y t h e P r e s i d e n t signed into law the "Federal Salary Act of 
Q f 
This law adjusts the annual rates of compensation in all steps 
each grade in the Federal Government General Schedule retroactive to 
*/irst day of the first pay period which begins on or after October 1, 
1967 
T h e e f f e c t i v e d a t e 
f o r t h e B o a r d > 
i f approved, would be October 8, 
In addition to the retroactive increase to October 8, 1967, the 
^ 
1 provides for subsequent increases effective July 1968 and July 1969. 
ir^ l a t t e r i n c r e a s e s 
provided to attain comparability between salaries 
^ 
tlle Federal Government and those paid in private industry, the private 
ustry salary rates being those determined by the yearly Bureau of Labor 
Statistics Survey. 
L 
The July 1968 increase is, insofar as it may be practical, to 
p ,st salaries by an amount equal to one-half of the difference between 
in 6 r. 
salaries and those paid to employees in the same levels of work 
Private industry, based on the findings of the 1967 BLS survey, or by 
r e e per cent, whichever increase is the greater. 
ex- 
, 
The July 1 % 9 increase, in essence, is to eliminate any difference 
s ing between the revised 1968 salary rates and the rates of pay in 
196ft G n C e 
s i m i l a r positions in private industry as determined by the 
BLS survey. 
Other noteworthy provisions of the Act are as follows: 
(1) Provides for an increase in the annual basic pay for Executive 
Schedule Level III positions from $28,500 to $29,500. 
Included in 
those positions affected are the Members of the Board, with the 
exception of the Chairman. 
(2) Establishes a new minimum coverage of $10,000 of life insurance 
for employees earning less than $8,000 increases maximum coverage 
t o $32,000, and provides those earning above $8,000 with an additional 
$2,000 worth of insurance. 
The cost to the employee for the standard 
Insurance will increase from 25 to 27.5 cents per $1,000 bi-weekly. 
Employees will also have the opportunity to purchase up to an 
additional $10,000 of life, as well as an equal amount of death and 
dismemberment insurance, providing they pay the full cost.

I n keeping with the Board's policy of maintaining a salary 
Peder ? r e f o r i t s employees comparable to that of other agencies of the 
al Government, it is recommended that the Board approve the following: 
(1) Revision of the Board's Regular Salary Schedule Retroactive 
to October 8, 1967 in accordance with attached table, which 
corresponds to the basic compensation rates established by the 
"Federal Salary Act of 1967." 
'Y 
(2) It is also recommended that the increased insurance benefits 
provided by this Act be approved by the Board. 
(3) The Controller's Office recommends approval of any over-
expenditures in the 1967 Salary and Employee Retirement and 
Insurance Benefits budgetary accounts resulting from approval 
of this proposal. 
'he j . 
connection with the implementation of these recommendations, 
aty>Uc °wing administrative procedures are recommended, as in past 
a ions of pay bill changes to pay rates of Board employees: 
(1) 
With the approval of the Board Member in charge of internal 
administrative affairs, the Division of Personnel Administration 
shall be responsible for making adjustments in the per diem and 
hourly rates of the WAE (when actually employed) employees, etc. 
(2) The Office of the Controller and the Division of Personnel 
Administration will use Government regulations and interpretations 
as guides in deciding questions of administration and procedure. 
y0a 
salary rate adjustments are included in these recommendations 
.emPi°yees paid under the Metropolitan D. C. Prevailing Rate Wage 
epartme 'mechanics, gardeners, painters, chauffeurs, etc.) and the Inter-
a^ mitnental Lith°graphic Wage Pay Schedule (offset press operators, multilith 
djUitme &raph operators, etc.) These employees receive periodic salary 
n t s as a result of annual wage surveys. 
jj^Uai s 
recommendations are made in this memorandum with regard to the 
etetTtiin 
r i e S ° f t h e B o a r d ' s Official Staff. It is assumed that any 
i°ns on this matter will be made by the Board, as in the past.

*8»000. This change becomes effective 60 days after the signing of the
