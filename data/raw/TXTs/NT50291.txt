Reappraisal of 1968 budget. There had been distributed a memo-
randum dated June 18, 1968, from the Office of the Controller and other 
Pertinent papers relating to a staff reappraisal of the Board's 1968 
budget undertaken in the light of prospective general governmental 
budgetary curtailments. 
It was the consensus of the division directors that reductions 
totaling approximately $520,000 (3.7 per cent of the adjusted budget) 
c°uld be effected during the remainder of the calendar year, through 
cancelation or deferment of certain prospective expenditures, with-
0 u t significant impairment of essential services. The proposals were 
summarized in section A of the distributed memorandum and were discussed 
greater detail in attached reports from the individual divisions. 
In section B of the distributed memorandum, other possible 
reductions totaling approximately $271,000 were mentioned. 
However, 
W a s the staff recommendation that these curtailments not be made in 
V i e w °f adverse effects on programs, services, and morale. 
t V- • 
Following summary remarks by Mr. Kakalec, Governor Sherrill 
that he and Governor Robertson had reviewed the proposals in 
^etail and felt that the cuts proposed in section A represented a 
erious effort on the part of the various divisions to limit expendi-
°n a discretionary basis. The proposals seemed reasonably in 
tures 
with what was likely to be done by other agencies under the 
^°Vernment program. On the other hand, he and Governor Robertson 

6/2l/68 
-3-
recommended against the cuts described in section B on the ground that 
they would seriously affect essential programs. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he objected in principle to the 
general procedure. An agency, such as the Board, which was charged 
with responsibility for a substantial part of the burden of stabiliza-
tion should not be required to respond in the same degree to a call 
general budgetary stringency as an agency not so involved. He 
Would have pressed more aggressively for a ranking of projects in terms 
their support to the stabilization effort. 
It appeared to him that 
t*le division-by-division approach was more in the nature of an across-
th i-
e~board reduction. Moreover, priorities should be assigned at Board 
^evel rather than at staff level, although he noted that the Division 
'v. 
International Finance apparently recognized the high priority of 
Glance of payments program. 
Governor Sherrill agreed that the proposal to effect reductions 
n the basis of analysis by division heads of the work of their respec-
t i v 
e divisions differed from the usual approach where cuts were allo-
ated by the top administrators. 
If it had appeared that the recom-
mendations of the staff would disrupt essential programs, assignment 
of Priorities would have had to be made at Board level. However, such 
did not appear to be the case. 
•.•In-,,. 
Governor Daane suggested that both approaches should achieve 
the 
e same goal, namely, elimination of lowest priority items in terms 
° f total workload.

Governor Maisel indicated that he would agree with Governor 
Brimmer's argument in part. However, the problem should also be studied 
^rom the standpoint of immediate impact as opposed to continuing effect 
°n longer-run programs. 
Chairman Martin then invited members of the staff to comment, 
and Mr. Partee said that the cuts proposed in the research area would 
• y • • * 
n°t affect the stabilization program. 
The major reduction would be in 
banking markets research, and that program was not closely related to 
stabilization effort. 
If, at a later date, there was a pressing 
ne^d for a particular survey the Board could authorize it even if it 
W a s n°t in the budget. 
The recommendation to leave certain positions 
Unfilled would not affect the research program immediately, although 
•vV'V'-v • 
frh 
ere would be some effect on the quantity of output and progress 
toWard longer-run goals. 
The Division of Research and Statistics 
would endorse the cuts recommended in section A, but would strenuously 
°Ppose those mentioned in section B. 
Mr. Partee then withdrew from the meeting. 
Chairman Martin noted that the problem was a difficult one, 
Governor Brimmer repeated that he did not see evidence that the 
bud 
a 
8et had been reviewed in terms of priorities. 
Governor Sherrill stated that a review was under way of an 
apProach to budgeting from the standpoint of program evaluation with 
i 
view to introducing the principle next year, but that at present the 
t a ff was not equipped to perform that task.

Governor Daane indicated that although he sympathized with 
Governor Brimmer's comments regarding the establishment of priorities, 
in view of the government program he would approve the proposals as 
submitted. 
He would reject section B, however. 
Mr. Solomon said it was his impression that the criteria sug-
gested by Governor Brimmer had been followed division by division. 
The 
Division of International Finance had followed that approach. 
Governor Daane and Mr. Solomon then withdrew from the meeting. 
. Kt i • Tv. 
Governor Brimmer noted that the Legal Division proposed to 
reduce its expenditures through leaving certain positions unfilled. 
GiVen the backlog of work and delays in getting material to the Board, 
would be inclined to encourage the Legal Division to request addi-
tional personnel rather than to cut back. 
Mr. O'Connell then summarized reasons that had led to the con-
C ^ s i 0 n that; 
Division's output would not suffer through a postpone -
merit in filling certain vacancies. 
He noted that several qualified 
attorneys would join the staff within the next few weeks and that a 
Pr°Posed reallocation of responsibilities should increase the output 
0 f the Division appreciably between now and the end of the year. 
Governor Brimmer said another of his reservations had to do 
Vi-th the proposals relating to the Banking Markets Section. 
It seemed 
him 
that more, rather than less, help was needed in that area and 
a high priority should be assigned.

Governor Mitchell observed that a reduction in survey expendi-
tures was involved. 
He agreed with Mr. Partee that if a specific 
S]-tuation arose where a market survey would be helpful, the Division 
should request restoration of funds. 
Governor Brimmer stated that his last reservation had to do 
with the proposal to defer filling vacancies in the Minutes Unit of 
the Secretary's Office. 
He would be reluctant to see a reduction that 
W o u l d result in a further lag in the preparation of minutes. 
Mr. Holland explained that the proposed deferral was in the 
9 r e a of indexing and that methods of shortening the minutes production 
time lag were under consideration. 
After further discussion the recommendations for reductions of 
e*Penditures as set forth in section A of the distributed memorandum 
W e r e accepted as a guide for operations under the budget for the second 
^alf of 1968, Governor Brimmer's reservations being noted. 
Members of the staff except Messrs. Holland and Johnson then 
withdrew from the meeting. 
Officer salaries. 
Governor Sherrill outlined to the Board a 
Schedule of increases in salaries of the officer staff that he would 
recoitmiend in conformity with increases soon to go into effect in the 
Ci-Vll Service general pay schedule. 
It was proposed that all officers 
1)6 granted increases comparable to those provided for the equivalent 
S t eP in the Civil Service pay schedule, so long as the resulting salary 

6/21/68 
- 7 -
not exceed $28,000. 
Officers whose salaries, calculated on this 
basis, would exceed $28,000 would have their salary increases com-
pacted to one of three levels: 
$29,000 (for two officers); $28,500 
(for 7 officers); and $28,000 (for 8 officers). 
This procedure would 
result in slightly higher compensation for senior officers than was 
t r u e under Civil Service, because the Civil Service schedule was 
c°mpacted at a ceiling of $28,000. 
The only other appreciable restruc-
turing W i t h i n the proposed schedule was to insure that each officer 
received as large an increase as he would have received if he had 
reinained a classified employee; the salary of only one officer (Mr. 
**art) was found to need upward adjustment under this rule. 
There was some discussion of the general desirability of com-
P a c ting Board staff salaries at ceilings equal to or close to Civil 
Service ceilings and under Board member ceilings. 
It was agreed the 
Pr°Posed salary increases should become effective in the pay period 
e g i r i n i ng on July 14. Announcement of the changes in official posi-
t i 0 n s approved by the Board on June 18, 1968, under the plan for 
e°rganization of certain staff functions was now planned for July 12, 
n d it was contemplated that the salary increases for such changed 
N 
f f i cial positions might be made effective with the pay period 
b eSinni n g J u l y

The Board agreed to defer final consideration and action on 
t h e scheduled salary increases until June 24 or 25, in order to permit

further study of the proposal. A memorandum on this subject dated 
June 21, 1968, was distributed by Governor Sherrill to the members of 
the Board in order to facilitate study of the matter. 
ForeiRn travel. Charles J. Siegman, currently on leave from 
tlle Division of International Finance to work at the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements, was authorized to spend up to 12 working days at 
tlle er*d of his tour of duty visiting various European financial centers,

Proposed check clearing center (Item No. 1). There had been 
distributed memoranda from Mr. Hackley, dated April 16, and from Mr. 
Farrell, dated April 17 and June 18, 1968, relating to the proposal of 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond for a regional check clearing 
Center i n the Washington-Baltimore area. 
J- 
. _ 
. 
In his memorandum Mr. Hackley discussed the questions (1) 
whether the Reserve Bank would be legally authorized to defray the 
eiltire expense of operation of the center, and (2) whether the pro-
Posed participation of nonmember banks would be subject to legal 
Ejection. Mr. Hackley concluded that (1) financial support of the 
Center by the Reserve Bank would be a legitimate expenditure of Fed-
e r al Reserve funds, although less question would exist if the center 
were 
operated as a regional clearing facility of the Reserve Bank; and 
(2) Participation of nonmember banks in various phases of the clearing 
angements would not contravene the intent of the Federal Reserve 
Act. 
tions 
In his April 17 memorandum Mr. Farrell discussed several ques-
that had been raised during a meeting of Board members with 
ePresentatives of the Reserve Bank on March 5, 1968. He recommended 
^ 
that the Reserve Bank be authorized to move ahead with the estab-
e n t of a Washington-Baltimore clearing center as a sub-office of 
<*

the Reserve Bank, and (2) that a steering committee be appointed to 
develop guidelines for settling policy questions arising in connection 
wi-th the establishment of this and other clearing arrangements. 
Mr. Farrell, in his June 18 memorandum, suggested that it would 
he helpful in evaluating the proposal if the Reserve Bank would furnish 
additional information as to (1) the advantages and disadvantages of 
having the proposed clearing operations performed at the Baltimore 
Branch rather than establishing a new office, and (2) the manner in 
which the banks that would be affected by the proposed clearing center 
W e re now handling their checks. 
Governor Mitchell recalled that at the meeting on March 5 with 
Ri k 
mond Reserve Bank representatives there was a long discussion of 
the 
aPpropriateness of an office that would be owned by the Reserve 
n k but operated in association with participating member and non-
member banks. Messrs. Hackley and Farrell had explored that question, 
they recommended that the Reserve Bank establish any such center 
as a . , 
sub-office or facility of the Reserve Bank. 
Governor Mitchell went on to discuss the need for improving 
heck clearing arrangements. 
The situation in the Washington area 
bviously needed improvement, but the Richmond proposal appeared to 
have 
certain inadequacies. Among other things, it left a number of 
S S U e s unsettled; it was not conclusive that the proposed arrangement 
b e either the most efficient or the most economical one. Accord-
6J-y> the Division of Bank Operations suggested that the Reserve Bank 

6 / 2 1 / 6 8 
- 1 2 -
take another look at the problem, and in order to reach a decision it 
would be helpful to have access to information as to the way in which 
checks were handled at present by the banks in the area. 
In this con-
nection, Governor Mitchell described a system that was in effect in 
St. Louis area and expressed a preference for that type of opera-
tion over the arrangement proposed by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond. 
Governor Mitchell indicated that he also concurred in the staff 
recommendation that a steering committee be appointed to develop guide-
lines in the area of check clearing. The Board needed to take a posi-
tion on the issue, but the situation was delicate and involved potential 
conflicts. 
Mr. Farrell agreed that strong guidance was needed for the 
development of guidelines relating to the establishment of clearing 
centers. The main function of the steering committee, as he envisaged 
would be to point out the issues on which the Reserve Banks should 
make recommendations as to procedures.

the position that such a procedure would be lawful. However, the Board 
had never formally adopted such a position, and a policy question was 
involved. 
If such a procedure were followed in the proposed Washington-
Baltimore clearing center, other offices in the Richmond District prob-
a^ly would be pressured to furnish the same service to nonmember banks. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he would be reluctant to approve 
the proposed facility unless nonmember banks were required to have 
clearing accounts with the Richmond Bank. Also, it was not clear to 
him what provisions were being made to make the arrangement attractive 
to member banks vis-a-vis nonmember banks. 
In further discussion Governor Mitchell pointed out that there 
W e re alternatives. 
Under a system such as that in effect in St. Louis 
a r e a> small banks would send items to their correspondent banks and 
the clearing center would in turn encode and sort the items before 
turning them over to the Reserve Bank. 
If this procedure were followed, 
small banks would be forced to deal with correspondents or forced into 
groups at computer centers. On the other hand, a policy might be 
adopted that would require nonmember banks to maintain clearing accounts 
with the Reserve Bank sub-office, with encoding and sorting to be done 
a t the sub-office. A major question was whether the Federal Reserve 
w°uld want to supplant correspondent banks in rendering services. 
FlJrther information was needed in order to make a decision. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the sending of a letter 
t o the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that would express agreement 

6/21/68 
-14-
with the need for improved clearing arrangements in the Baltimore-
Washington 
area but would request additional information along the 
lines recommended in the distributed material and discussed at today's 
meeting. A copy of the letter subsequently transmitted is attached as 
i. 
United Nations Special Fund (Item No. 2). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated June 19, 1968, from Mr. Forrestal relating 
t o a request from The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(National Association), 
YV > 
New York, New York, for a ruling that the exemption from interest rate 
limitations granted in section 19(j) of the Federal Reserve Act with 
respect to the time deposits of certain foreign official institutions 
0 :;,.5 
w a s applicable to time deposits of the United Nations Special Fund. 
In 1963 the Board had held that the time deposits of the Fund were not 
exempt. 
IO'U ' 
.; 
> r, 
The memorandum analyzed the situation in the light of the pro-
visions of law and the activities conducted through the Special Fund. 
reasons set forth in the memorandum, Mr. Forrestal concluded that 
there had not been sufficient change in the circumstances to warrant 
revision of 
the previous Board position. Attached to the memorandum 
W a s a proposed letter to Chase Manhattan reflecting that recommendation. 
Mr. Forrestal noted that under the present authority relating 
t o the flexible regulation of interest rates the Board probably would 
empowered to exempt the time deposits of the United Nations Special 
Furid. However, he did not recommend such a course.

Mr. Aubrey N. Heflin, President,

°ear Mr. Heflin: 
This refers to the proposal for a regional check 
clearing center in the Washington-Baltimore area which was 
discussed by you and Mr. Black with the Board on March 5, 
1968. 
c 
After further consideration of this matter, the 
Board agreed that there is a need for improvement in the 
arrangements for check collections in the Washington-
Baltimore area. 
The Board also agreed that it would be 
appropriate for your Bank to move ahead with explorations 
°f the possibilities of establishing a clearing center in 
the area along the lines of the proposal discussed at the 
March meeting, but with the understanding that any such 
undertaking would be in the form of a sub-office or 
facility of your Bank rather than a contractual associa-
tion. 
Before expressing any further views with regard 
to the proposed clearing center, the Board would like to have 
more information with respect to three questions: 
(a) the 
W a y in which the banks in the area are now handling their 
checks, (b) alternative possibilities with respect to the 
Baltimore Branch, and (c) what are the best arrangements for 
Participation by nonmember banks, bearing in mind a continu-
ing emphasis on providing better services at lower costs for 
Member banks. 
The Board believes that the possible benefits of 
the proposed clearing center in the form of improved public 
services must be judged, partly at least, in light of their 
costs to the System. 
Accordingly, it would like to have 
m°re detailed information about the way in which the present 
system operates--e.g., how does each Bank handle amount 
encoding, sorting, and collection services, and what are the 

-2-
| Si .-7 {• 
delivery arrangements, deadline requirements and other agree-
ments under which the services are obtained or provided. 
The 
Board suggests that more specific details with regard to the 
information to be obtained might be worked out in consultations 
between your staff and the Division of Bank Operations. 
The basic question raised by the Board with respect 
to the Baltimore Branch is whether there would be a continuing 
need for two offices--i.e. . one in Baltimore and one in the 
Washington area, as against the alternative possibilities of 
handling the operations of the proposed clearing center at the 
Baltimore Branch or moving all of the operations now handled 
at Baltimore to a new office to be established in the 
Washington area. 
The Board believes that a full study of 
these possibilities would be desirable before any final deci-
sion is reached with regard to the location of the clearing 
center operations, particularly in the light of the impact 
such a decision might have on the current program to acquire 
more land for contemplated expansion of the Baltimore Branch 
and on the future space and personnel needs of the Branch. 
•• •' t , 
On the matter of participation of nonmember banks in 
the proposed clearing center, the basic question is the effect 
any change in clearing arrangements would have on the attrac-
tiveness of Federal Reserve membership. 
For example, should 
nonmember banks be required to maintain a clearing account with 
your Bank in order to be permitted to participate in the clear-
ing arrangement? 
Very truly yours, 
Or-]?,. . 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.

Dear Sirs: 
This is in response to your letter of May 23, 1968, 
requesting a ruling that the United Nations Special Fund is an 
'international financial institution" within the meaning of the 
tenth paragraph of section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 
371b) and section 217.3 of Regulation Q. As you know, the Board 
in 1963 concluded that the Special Fund could not reasonably be 
regarded as a foreign government, monetary or financial authority 
a foreign government, or an international financial institution 
which the United States is a member for purposes of the exemption 
from maximum interest rate limitations contained in section 19 of 
the Federal Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation Q. In that 
ruling, the Board noted that the Special Fund, as it then functioned, 
^id not make loans or investments. 
The United Nations Special Fund is engaged primarily in 
carrying out specific preparatory projects in connection with national 
and regional programs. Although the Board understands that the 
Special Fund has on occasion made some loans, such loans appear to 
have been exceptional in nature and not to have been made in the 
ordinary course of the Fund's activities. 
on < 
On the basis of the information available, there does not 
appear to have been a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant 
a change in the Board's position that the Special Fund may not be 
regarded as an international "financial" institution of which the 
United States is a member and, accordingly, that time deposits of 
the F u nd are not exempt from the maximum interest rate limitations 
Prescribed by the Board pursuant to section 19 of the Federal Reserve 
Act. 
Very truly yours, 
(signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Except as provided in Section 211.3(a) of Regulation K, the 
?rP°ration may not exercise any of the other powers conferred by Sec-
. l 0 n 25(a) until it has received a final permit from the Board authorizing

^^terest i n which is owned by citizens of the United States; and (3) that 
the authorized capital stock specified in the Articles of Association 
ha
 1 ? a s t 2 5 P e r c e n t has been paid in in cash and that each shareholder
