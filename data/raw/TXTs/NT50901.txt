Virginia National Bankshares. The members of the Board had been 
furnished copies of a draft order reflecting denial, on April 6, 1972, of 

4/12/72 
-2-
the application of Virginia National Bankshares, Inc., Norfolk, Virginia, 
to become a bank holding company through acquisition of shares of the 
successors by merger to Virginia National Bank, Norfolk, Virginia, and 
The Colonial-American National Bank of Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia. Copies 
a dissenting statement by Governor Daane also had been distributed. 
Discussion centered upon a view that the draft explanation of 
the majority position unduly stressed the foreclosure of potential com-
petition. Governor Daane said it had been his understanding that the 
denial decision had rested primarily on that question. He wondered whether 
the disposition not to stress it might imply a change in attitude. Gov-
ernor Mitchell reminded the Board that he had considered the case so 
dose that he could vote on either side in good conscience, but that in 
ar*y event he would vote with the majority . Negative responses were made 
t o an inquiry whether any of the other members of the majority were in-
clined to change their positions. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
rationale underlying the majority decision would be redrafted in consul-
tation with Chairman Burns and Governors Robertson and Daane,' and issuance 
the documents as thus revised was authorized. 
(It later developed that time pressures precluded obtaining agree-
ment upon a revised statement for issuance today. The question was there-
fore redocketed.) 
The meeting then adjourned.
