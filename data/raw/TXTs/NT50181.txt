Investment in bank premises (Item No. 1). The Board approved 
imously the application of Kanawha Banking and Trust Company, 
^arleston, West Virginia, pursuant to section 24A of the Federal 
Serve Act, to make an investment in bank premises. A copy of the

uted =

tions a A 
d n d other pertinent papers relating to the application of Atlantic

Trust Company, Jacksonville, Florida, a registered bank holding com-
pany, for prior approval of the Board to acquire more than 80 per cent 
of the voting shares of The Atlantic National Bank of Jacksonville, 
Jacksonville, Florida. Approval of the application was recommended by 
the Division of Examinations, as well as by the Banking Markets Section 
ar*d the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The application involved only 
a reorganization of the existing bank holding company structure, and 
the proposal would have no effect on concentration, competition, or 
convenience and needs. 
After a review of the material contained in the documentation 
the application was approved unanimously, with the understanding that 
atl order and statement would be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Delegation of authority (Items 2 and 3). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum from the Division of Examinations and the Legal 
^visicm dated November 17, 1967, concerning delegation of authority. 
Ef f 
Active July 1, 1967, the Federal Reserve Banks had been delegated 
authority to approve on behalf of the Board applications by State 
member banks to establish branches, to pay dividends under certain 
Otlc*itions, to reduce capital stock, and to invest in bank premises, 
Provided, among other criteria, that the applicant bank's capital was 
°luate in relation to the character and condition of its assets and 
its deposit liabilities and other corporate responsibilities, includ-
n8 the volume of its risk assets and of its marginal and inferior qual-
ty assets, all considered in relation to the strength of its management. 

11/22/67

Since the delegation of authority became effective, many appli-
cations, primarily branch applications, had been submitted to the Board 
for action because the Reserve Banks were unable to make a determina-
tion that the member bank's capital was "adequate." In most cases, 
however, the bank's capital was just below the "adequate" level, and 
in all cases the Reserve Banks had recommended approval of the applica-
tion. 
In order to reduce the number of applications submitted to the 
Board, it was proposed either that the guidelines be relaxed so as to 
Permit the Reserve Banks to approve applications in certain cases in 
the bank's capital was not technically "adequate," or that 
authority to act on those applications that the Reserve Banks referred 
t° the Board be delegated to the Director of the Division of Examina-
tions. The Legal and Examinations Divisions recommended adoption of 
the latter proposal — particularly since this would almost certainly 
result in more uniform treatment of applications. Moreover, the Divi-
si°n of Examinations would be in a better position to make comments 
about the need for increasing capital funds, improving liquidity, or 
Aligning assets. 
After a review of the matter by Mr. Solomon, during which he 
r°ught out that any serious problems would continue to be presented 
to the Board for consideration, Governor Brimmer noted that the pro-
p0sal was in line with suggestions he had made earlier. He was a 

4534 
11/22/67 
-4-
little concerned that delegation to the Division of Examinations might 
give the appearance of taking something away from the Reserve Banks. 
On balance, however, he would support the recommendation, particularly 
because of the desirability for uniformity of treatment. At some 
future time, when more experience with such applications had been 
accumulated, the Board could consider a delegation to the Reserve Banks 
°f the authority that would presently be given to the Board's staff. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that the Board should 
proceed on a step-by-step basis in delegating functions. He indicated 
his support of the recommendation. 
The Board then approved unanimously the addition of the follow-
ing 
new paragraph to section 265.2(c) of its Rules Regarding Delegation 
o f Authority: 
(c) The Director of the Division of Examinations (or, in his 
absence, the Acting Director) is authorized: 
•k -k -k 
(10) To exercise the functions described in subparagraphs 
(1), (2), (4), and (7) of paragraph (f) of this section in cases 
in which the conditions specified in such subparagraphs as pre-
requisites to exercise of such functions by the Federal Reserve 
Banks are not present or in which, even though such conditions 
are present, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank considers 
that nevertheless it should not take action on the member bank's 
request.

Dear Sir: 
The Board has amended its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority 
to authorize the Director of the Division of Examinations to permit a State 
Member bank (1) to establish a domestic branch, (2) to declare dividends 
excess of net profits, (3) to reduce its capital stock, and (4) to in-
in bank premises in an amount in excess of its capital stock. 
nclosed is a copy of the document with respect to this amendment that 
W a s forwarded for publication in the Federal Register. 
ifiV . '« . . 
*> i i 
The amendment does not alter the authority previously delegated 
0 the Federal Reserve Banks. Within the Board's organization, however, 
will permit more expeditious action in many cases. The following 
lustration may be helpful. 
Assume that the appropriate Reserve Bank's review of the circum-
b
 a^ces surrounding an application for permission to establish a domestic 
tanch indicates that the considerations set forth in section 265.2(f)(1) 
the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority are consistent 
c
lth approvai, except that the Reserve Bank does not consider member bank's 
Q®Pitalization entirely "adequate in relation to the character and condition 
lts assets and to its deposit liabilities and other corporate respon-
8lbiUties". 
a 
As a result, the Reserve Bank is not authorized to approve the 
old 
a t i o n o n behalf of the Board. Under the new procedure, as under the 
» the Reserve Bank forwards the application to the Board with its 
had°mir'endatlon* Formerly, after review by the staff, the application 
t 0 C0Ine b cf° r c t h c Board for decision. Under the new procedure the 
of the Division of Examinations may act on the application on 
-i . At of the Board--either by approving or by denying the request--
the
 
c a s e s of particular complexity will continue to be submitted to 
B°ard for determination.
