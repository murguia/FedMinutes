May 4, 1973, June 25, 1973, and May 22, 1974, respectively; accordingly, 
it was understood their reappointments would be subject to the under-
standing stated in the Board's letter to the Reserve Bank Chairmen 
dated January 6, 1966. 
The reappointments were approved unanimously, along with payment 
of salary at the rates indicated. 
Testimony before Joint Economic Committee. A draft had been 
distributed of a statement to be presented by Chairman Burns before the 
Joint Economic Committee on February 19, 1971. 
Basic agreement with the draft testimony was expressed, although 
some additional points were suggested by individual members of the Board 
as deserving of comment. Several of these were noted for consideration 
in connection with the question and answer portion of the hearing, and

sections of the draft statement were revised or expanded to accommodate 
others. Additional suggestions, made for purposes of clarification or 
amplification, were to be taken into account in editing the statement. 
Among the points considered was the question of including a 
reference in the statement to the need for an incomes policy. It was 
the unanimous view that, under present conditions, monetary and fiscal 
policies needed to be supplemented with an incomes policy, that is to 
say, with measures that aim to improve the workings of labor and product 
markets so that upward pressures on costs and prices will be reduced. 
It was agreed that the statement should indicate that this was the con-
sidered judgment of the Board. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
statement would be reviewed in the light of the comments made and that 
it would be presented in a final form satisfactory to the Chairman. 
(Note: A copy of the statement, as presented, has been placed in the 
Board's files.) 
Report on proposed bill. Unanimous approval was given to a 
let ter to the Office of Management and Budget regarding a draft bill 
Proposed by the Civil Service Commission with respect to the establish-
ment of maximum age limitations for entry into some positions within 
the competitive service. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 1. 
Question was raised regarding the possibility of delegating to 
the staff authority to reply to requests from the Office of Management

and Budget for views on draft bills on subjects that did not appear 
particularly relevant to the Board's functions. Members of the Board 
expressed the view that it would desirable to consider handling such 
letters either under such a delegated authority or by way of the con-
sent calendar. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Mr. Rommel: 
This is in response to your request for the Board's 
views on a draft bill proposed by the Civil Service Commission. 
At present the law prevents the establishment of maximum age 
limits for entry into the competitive^service. Under the bill 
CSC would be authorized to establish such limits x^hen age is 
found to be a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably 
necessary to the performance of the duties involved. 
The proposal does not apply to the Board, and it has 
no comments on the draft bill to offer for your consideration. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon
