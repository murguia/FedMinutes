Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and Dallas on July 9 and by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City on July 13, 1970, of the rates on discounts and advances

question of a delegation of authority to approve applications for 
membership in the Federal Reserve System.

Colorado CNB Bankshares. After consideration of staff documenta-
tion that had been distributed, the Board unanimously approved the 
application of Colorado CNB Bankshares, Inc., Denver, Colorado, to 
acquire shares of The Bank of Glenwood, Glenwood Springs, Colorado. 
The Board also authorized the issuance of an order reflecting this 
decision in the form attached as Item No. 4. 
Other holding company cases. The Board authorized the issuance 
of orders (copies attached under Item No. 5) reflecting approval on 
June 30, 1970, of applications of Fidelity American Bankshares, Inc., 
Lynchburg, Virginia, to acquire shares of The Buchanan National Bank, 
Buchanan; The Bank of Natural Bridge, Natural Bridge Station; and the 
successor by merger to Bank of Hampton Roads, Newport News. 
The Board also authorized the issuance of orders reflecting 
approval on June 25, 1970, of applications of Southeast Bancorporation, 
Inc., Miami, Florida, to acquire shares of Citizens Bank of Brevard, 
Melbourne, and First National Bank of Satellite Beach, Satellite Beach, 
and denial of its applications to acquire shares of First National Bank 
of Eau Gallie, Melbourne, and Indialantic Beach Bank, Indialantic, along 
with a statement relating to all four of the applications. Copies of 
the orders and statement are attached under Item No. 6. 
Minority lending program. Consideration was given to a request 
by the American Bankers Association, discussed in a memorandum dated 
July 8, 1970, from the Division of Supervision and Regulation, that the 

2 0 7 9 
7/14/70 
-4-
Board, along with other Federal bank supervisory agencies, issue a 
statement relaxing certain aspects of bank examination policy. 
Governor 
Brimmer had presented reservations about the request in a memorandum of 
July 13, which he supplemented with comments at today's meeting. 
The Association hoped that the requested statement would 
encourage banks to participate in its billion-dollar campaign to 
finance minority businesses, on the assumption that bank examiners 
would be less prone to criticize loans to minority businesses that 
might involve high risks. Governor Brimmer believed that the issuance 
of the proposed statement might generate great pressure on small 
minority-owned banks to make risky loans. In his opinion the ABA 
proposal represented primarily a public relations gesture. 
Therefore, 
he recommended that the Board request the other supervisory agencies 
and the Association to reconsider the proposal. If this recommendation 
was not acceptable, he advocated review by the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Bank Regulation. 
Governor Daane found Governor Brimmer's reasoning persuasive. 
He suggested reference to the Coordinating Committee as a first step, 
after which the Board,if necessary, could make known its reservations 
to the Association. 
Governor Sherrill noted that if in fact an additional billion 
dollars could be made available to minority businesses, that would be 
worthwhile. He was willing to refine the proposal, but he would not 

2 0 8 0 
7/14/70 
-5-
be disposed to discourage the effort to provide additional credit. He 
believed that pressure on small minority-owned banks to grant high-risk 
loans was already severe and would not be increased appreciably. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that, although no one 
would want to stand in the way of providing an additional billion 
dollars of credit, the proposed statement would not achieve that result. 
Other mechanisms, such as development banks, held greater promise. He 
agreed that the matter should be referred to the Coordinating Committee 
for further study. 
Chairman Burns also expressed misgivings about a relaxation of 
examining standards, especially under present circumstances. On the 
other hand, he thought the effort being made by the ABA was commendable 
and should be encouraged if possible. He believed that the suggestion 
for study by the Coordinating Committee might be the best course. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that the 
question would be taken up with the Coordinating Committee and that the 
substance of Governor Brimmer's memorandum would be made available to 
the Committee. 
Truth in lending survey. In a memorandum dated July 10, 1970, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended that the Board 
authorize a contract with Chilton Research Services of Philadelphia to 
conduct a second survey of consumer awareness of credit finance charges 
and interest rates in September 1970. The purpose was to provide a basis 

7/14/70 
-6-
for evaluating the effectiveness of the Truth in Lending Act in achiev-
ing its goal of assisting consumers in the informed use of credit. The 
information gained would be compared with that collected in the first 
benchmark survey conducted just prior to the effective date of Regula-
tion Z. The cost of the second survey would be $99,000, which would be 
a budget overexpenditure. 
Questions raised during discussion were whether the survey could 
be postponed and whether its cost could be reduced by confining its cover-
age to a particular region or to a smaller number of communities across 
the country, or by reducing the size of the sample. 
It was recalled that some degree of commitment had been given 
to the Congress to conduct a second survey, which would provide a better 
basis for the year-end report on administration of the Truth in Lending 
Act. Limitation of coverage to a particular region or to selected 
cities would not achieve comparability with the first survey. Some 
reduction of the sample size might be possible, but exploration would 
be needed to determine whether a savings could be made without jeopardiz-
ing objectives. 
It was agreed that staff would study that question and 
report to Governor Robertson. 
The Board then authorized entering into the contract for the 
survey, and the resulting budget overexpenditure, subject to clearance 
with Governor Robertson of the question of reducing the cost.

Bank subordinated notes. In a memorandum dated July 10, 1970, 
Governor Sherrill referred to the recent amendments to Regulation D, 
Reserves of Member Banks, and Regulation Q, Interest on Deposits, 
exempting from the definition of "deposits" subordinated obligations 
issued by banks that meet certain requirements and are approved by the 
Comptroller in the case of a national bank and by the Board in the case 
of a State member bank "as an addition to the bank's capital structure." 
Governor Sherrill recommended that authority to give approval under this 
provision be delegated to the Reserve Banks. 
Discussion developed agreement to defer the question of delega-
tion in view of questions, as reported by Governor Robertson, that had 
been raised by the Comptroller of the Currency regarding standards that 
should be applied. 
Interpretation of Regulation Q. The Legal Division, in a 
memorandum dated July 1, 1970, stated that several inquiries had been 
received from Federal Reserve Banks regarding the effect of the action 
of the Board removing interest rate ceilings for single maturity time 
deposits of $100,000 or more with maturities from 30 to 89 days. The 
major questions were described and a draft interpretation was attached. 
The interpretation was approved unanimously. A copy thereof 
is attached as Item No. 7. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance.

Notes of agricultural organizations. 
Governor Brimmer commented 
on a meeting he and Governor Robertson expected to have this afternoon 
with representatives of the American Bankers Association regarding the 
growing practice of Federal Land Banks and Federal Intermediate Credit 
Banks in selling, through related organizations, notes in small denomina-
tions with interest rates as high as 6.5 per cent. 
The ensuing discussion included the observation that while the 
national total of such notes sold might not be great, in smaller agri-
cultural communities their competitive impact could be important. 
It 
was understood that the Treasury was aware of the problem and was 
following developments. 
Contingency planning. The report of a staff group on contingency 
planning was presented in documents attached to a memorandum dated July 13, 
1970, from Mr. Holland. One memorandum proposed operational procedures 
for "earmarked" (or conduit) loans; a suggested list of guidelines for 
Reserve Banks in administering such loans was attached. A second 
memorandum outlined circumstances in which direct loans under paragraph 3 
of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act might be considered. 
Related 
documents discussed legal and administrative considerations, a suggested 
revision of a Board circular under which paragraph 3 loans last were 
administered, and a suggested list of supplemental guidelines. A 
memorandum prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discussed 
developments in the financial market bearing upon the possible need for 

2 0 8 4 
7/14/70 
-9-
Federal Reserve lending under paragraph 3 and suggested procedures that 
might be appropriate in connection with such lending. 
Mr. Holland reported that the staff group was in agreement on 
the guidelines now presented, with the exception of the extent to which 
Federal Reserve support should be given to earmarked loans. Some of 
the group felt that the Federal Reserve should carry the loan for the 
conduit member bank for whatever period of time was necessary for the 
ultimate borrower to discharge the indebtedness. Others felt that, if 
it became apparent that the member bank's liquidity position had eased 
to the extent that it could make repayment without hardship, it should 
be invited to do so. 
In response to an inquiry regarding distinctions seen by the 
staff between loans that would be made through a conduit and under 
section 13(3), it was explained that basically the latter authority 
would be used when the public interest was considered to justify accom-
modating borrowers less creditworthy than those for whom member banks 
were willing to accept the risk of acting as a conduit. However, any 
direct loan would be one that was considered to be ultimately sound. 
Expressions regarding the question of the liberal versus the 
conservative approach to earmarked loans suggested that the choice 
might depend on circumstances. 
Chairman Burns indicated that if the 
plans were to be implemented now, he would choose the conservative 
path, but if and when the need for action came the situation might 

2
0
8

7/14/70 
-10-
require the liberal approach. Governor Daane advocated leaving both 
approaches open, although he leaned toward being liberal. Governor 
Brimmer believed that the Federal Reserve should be prepared to do 
what it could to forestall catastrophes, but he did not think it should 
be willing to take on whatever credits a member bank frowned upon. 
Governor Sherrill thought the merit of doing everything possible through 
earmarked loans rather than under the third paragraph of section 13 was 
clear; resort to the latter authority would be an admission that the 
end of the line had been reached, and it would be significant that the 
risk would be shifted from the commercial banks to the central bank. 
He favored a two-step approach to earmarked loans, with a conservative 
attitude at first, broadened to a liberal one if necessary. Governor 
Robertson also spoke in favor of exhausting possibilities for earmarked 
loans before making direct loans available. 
Chairman Burns noted that in forthcoming testimony before the 
Joint Economic Committee he might be asked whether the Federal Reserve 
had made contingency plans, and he inquired whether any harm would 
result if he replied in the affirmative. Governor Brimmer expressed 
the view that harm would result if the banking community was aware that 
plans were in readiness because it would be inclined to call upon the 
Federal Reserve rather than use its own resources. The ensuing discus-
sion indicated agreement that no specific terms or sequence of steps 
should be chosen now. Thus, a proper response to any Congressional 

mm 
7/14/70 
-11-
inquiry could be that the Federal Reserve was always making contingency 
plans, that the plans were only under construction, and that the specific 
terms of any plan would be determined according to any particular need 
that arose. Keeping the plans fluid also would have the merit of 
obviating the need to publish in the Annual Report the adoption by the 
Board of any particular plan that it had not been necessary to implement. 
If the public became aware of the adoption of a plan, apprehension might 
be created that crises could be expected. 
Chairman Burns observed that, although the use of section 13(3) 
was the more remote contingency, it was desirable to have an understand-
ing of how it would be implemented if necessary. He noted that the 
statute permitted use of the authority only in unusual and exigent cir-
cumstances, and with five affirmative votes. He inquired whether, with 
expected absences on the part of members of the Board, it would be 
defensible to obtain votes by telephone if a sufficient number of 
members could not be physically present. Responses indicated that 
votes obtained by telephone could be deemed to comply with the statute 
(1) because of the urgency of the circumstances in which such an action 
would be contemplated, and (2) because the action would have been pre-
ceded by discussions such as today's when five or more members were 
present. There was agreement that, if the occasion for use of the 
authority should arise at a time when any members of the Board were 
absent, an effort would be made to reach all absent members in order 

2087 
7/14/70 
-12-
to obtain their votes, even though sufficient affirmative votes could 
be recorded by members who were physically present. Inability to 
reach any particular member, however, would not preclude action if the 
other members could record the vote required by statute. 
There was also the question of acquainting Reserve Banks with 
the status of the contingency planning. The staff had already con-
sulted several discount officers, and it was suggested that other 
discount officers might be brought in for briefing. However, a con-
sensus developed in favor of first making the Reserve Bank Presidents 
aware of the plans, through discussion and the distribution of appro-
priate documentation at a meeting prior to next Tuesday's meeting of 
the Federal Open Market Committee. 
All members of the staff then withdrewn except Messrs. Holland, 
Kenyon, Hackley, and F. Solomon. 
Financial developments. Mr. Holland reported on developments 
in the commercial paper market, which appeared generally favorable 
except with regard to a particular finance company that had found it 
necessary to make further resort to bank credit lines. 
Parsons Group banks. Governor Robertson reported on further 
steps that had been taken or were in contemplation by supervisory 
authorities in dealing with the problems of the so-called Parsons Group 
banks. It was his view that the situation had reached the stage, or 
would shortly so develop, that it was necessary to delegate negotiating 

2088 
7/14/70 
-13-
responsibility to one member of the Board. That member should be 
relieved of the requirement of reporting to the Board and obtaining 
a decision on each step in the negotiating process, but he would be 
expected to report to the Board on significant developments and to 
check with the Board at critical points. 
After discussion, Governor Robertson was designated to assume 
the aforementioned negotiating responsibility on behalf of the Board, 
subject to the conditions indicated and with the understanding that 
the Board was interested in having negotiations conducted in a manner 
that would not force banks of the Parsons Group, particularly Bank of 
the Commonwealth, into insolvency. 
Chicago Bank. In response to a question raised by Governor 
Robertson with respect to the contemplated appointment of Robert P. Mayo 
as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Board concluded 
that it would be appropriate for Governor Robertson to advise Mr. Mayo 
and the Chairman of the Chicago Bank that in the view of the Board a 
Reserve Bank President should not own, directly or indirectly, stock 
of any member bank or bank holding company and should not be indebted 
to any member bank in his District; but that the Board would be agree-
able to such interim arrangement as Mr. Mayo and the directors of the 
Chicago Bank might work out, provided that at the time Mr. Mayo took 
office all bank stock and stock of bank holding companies would be 
placed completely out of Mr. Mayo's own control, preferably in an

irrevocable trust, with the further condition that the stock would be

completely disposed of within six months thereafter. 
(A copy of the

letter sent by Governor Robertson to Mr. Mayo has been placed in the 
confidential files of the Office of the Secretary.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

Organization Committee, 
Monroe County Bank, 
Sweetwater, Tennessee. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
approves the application made on behalf of Monroe County Bank, 
Sweetwater, Tennessee, for stock in the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Atlanta, effective if and when the bank opens for business 
under appropriate State authorization, subject to the numbered 
conditions hereinafter set forth,, 
1. 
Such bank at all times shall conduct its business and 
exercise its powers with due regard to the safety of 
its depositors, and except with the permission of the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, such 
bank shall not cause or permit any change to be made in 
the corporate powers exercised by it at the time of 
admission to membership. 
2. 
The net capital and surplus funds of such bank shall be 
adequate in relation to the character and condition of 
its assets and to its deposit liabilities and other cor-
porate responsibilities. 
3. 
At the time of admission to membership, such bank shall 
have paid-in and unimpaired capital stock of not less 
than $200,000, and other capital funds of not less than 
$400,000.' 
In connection with the foregoing conditions of membership, 
particular attention is called to the provisions of the Board's 
Regulation If, regarding membership of State banking institutions in 
the Federal Reserve System, with especial reference to Section 208.7 
thereof. A copy of the regulation is enclosed.

If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's 
charter is made, the bank should advise the Federal Reserve Bank, 
furnishing copies of any documents involved in order that it may 
be determined whether such change affects in any way the bank's 
status as a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
Acceptance of the conditions of membership contained in 
this letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the 
board of directors after the bank's Certificate of Authority to 
Commence Business has been issued. The board of directors should 
also adopt, at the. same time, a resolution ratifying the action which 
has been taken in the bank's behalf in making application for membership 
in the Federal Reserve System. A certified copy of each resolution, 
together with advice of compliance with the provisions of condition 
numbered 3, should be transmitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta. Arrangements will thereupon be made to accept payment for 
an appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock, to accept the 
deposit of the required reserve balance, and to issue the appropriate 
amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock to the bank. 
The time within which admission to membership in the Federal 
Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished is limited 
to 6 months from the date of this letter, unless the bank applies to 
the Board and obtains an extension of time. When the Board is advised 
that all of the requirements have been complied with and that the 
appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock has been issued to 
the bank, the Board will forward to the bank a formal certificate of 
membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board of Governors sincerely hopes that you will find 
membership in the System beneficial and your relations with the 
Reserve Bank pleasant. The officers of the Federal Reserve Bank will 
be glad to assist you in establishing your relationships with the 
Federal Reserve System and at any time to discuss with representatives 
of your bank means for making the services of the System most useful 
to you. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.

Mro Co William Fischer, for 
Assistant Director for Legislative Reference, 
Bureau of the Budget, 
Washington, D. C. 20503 
Dear Mr. Fischer: 
This is in reply to your memorandum received on June 25, 1970, 
requesting the Board's views on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's 
draft letter dated June 15 to the House Committee on Banking and Currency 
relating to H«R. 16234, a bill "To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act." 
H.R. 16234 would amend subsection (b) of section 5A of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1425a). As presently in effect 
that subsection provides that Federal Home Loan Bank members must main-
tain certain liquidity requirements, which may be (1) in cash, "(2) to 
such extent as the Board may approve for the purposes of this section, 
time and savings deposits in Federal Home Loan Banks and commercial 
banks," and (3) as approved by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in 
obligations of the United States and its political subdivisions, and in 
bankers' acceptances. Clause (2) of this subsection would be amended by 
H.Rc 16234 to read, "(2) unpledged deposits in a Federal Home Loan Bank 
°r in a State bank performing similar functions and in operation on 
February 6, 1970, and to such extent as the Board may approve for the 
purposes of this section, time and savings deposits in commercial banks,.. 
The Board of Governors understands that the only private 
institution in operation on February 6, 1970, which might be construed 
as a State bank performing functions similar to those of a Federal Home 
Loan Bank is the Bank for Savings and Loan Associations, Chicago, Illinois 
(the "Bank")„ 
(The Board notes the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's view 
that the Bank does not perform the similar functions of a Federal Home 
Loan Bank.) The Board further understands that the Bank is owned by 
savings and loan associations in the State of Illinois, and that its 
deposits are not insured by any State or Federal agency. 

mm 
Mr. C. William Fischer 
- 2 -
The purpose of H.R. 16234 appears to be to require the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board to permit members of Federal Home Loan Banks to 
satisfy their liquidity requirements by deposits in the Bank. The 
amount of these deposits would not be subject to regulation by the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board as would be so in the case of deposits in 
commercial banks. Deposits in the Bank, which is not Federally regulated, 
would be treated on a parity with deposits in Federal Home Loan Banks, 
which are so regulated. The Board is unaware of any reason why the Bank, 
a private institution, whose deposits are uninsured and which is not 
subject to Federal regulation, should be given such a preferred status 
and is therefore not in favor of the proposed legislation. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.

Item No. 4 
7/14/70 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
COLORADO CNB BANKSHARES, INC., 
Denver, Colorado, 
for approval of the acquisition of at 
least 80 per cent of the voting shares 
°f The Bank of Glenuood, Glenwood Springs, 
Colorado. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF 
BANK STOCK BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1042(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), the application of Colorado CNB Banlcshares, Inc., 
Denver, Colorado ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding company, for 
the Board's prior approval of the acquisition of at least 30 per cent 
of the voting shares of The Bank of Glenwood, Glenwood Springs, 
Colorado ("Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
notice of receipt of the application to the Colorado State Bank Commissioner 
and requested his views and recommendation. The Colorado State Bank Com-
missioner advised the Board that the State Banking Board recommended neither 
approval nor disapproval of the application. 

2 0 9 6 
-2* 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on Hay 26, 1970 (35 Federal Register 3252), providing 
ar* opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views with 
respect to the proposal. A copy of the application was forwarded to the 
United States Department of Justice for its consideration. Time for 
filing comments and views has expired and all those received have been 
considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
ar*d the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Upon such 
consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant has four subsidiary banks with aggregate deposits of 
$303.9 million, which represents 7.7 per cent of the total deposits in 
tlie State. It is the third largest banking organization and third largest 
bank holding company in Colorado. (All banking data are as of December 31, 
1969. adjusted to reflect holding company acquisitions approved by the 
Board to date.) Bank, with deposits of $5.7 million, is the smallest of 
tv>o banks in Glenuood Springs, and is the fourth largest of the five banks 
located within the relevant market, which includes parts of Garfield, 
Eagle, and Pitkin Counties. Applicant's closest subsidiary is 160 miles 
east of Bank. Three of Applicant's subsidiary banks do not compete at all 
with Bank. Applicant's lead bank, which now serves as Bank's principal

correspondent, derives sorae business from Bank's service area; however, 
its activity has been directed to loans beyond the resources of Bank. 
Bank's affiliation with Applicant should foster competition by enabling 
Bank to become a stronger competitor within the existing banking structure. 
Consummation of the proposed acquisition therefore would not eliminate 
meaningful competition or foreclose significant potential competition, 
and would not have any undue adverse effects on other banks in the area 
involved. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
the proposed acquisition would not adversely affect competition in 
any relevant area. The banking factors are regarded as consistent with 
approval of the application. Considerations relating to the convenience 
and needs of the communities to be served lend some weight in support of 
approval since Bank, through affiliation with Applicant, will be able 
t o provide trust services and larger credit lines. It is the Board's 
judgment that consummation of the proposed acquisition would be in the 
P^lic interest, and that the application should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, on the basis of the Board's findings 
summarized above, that said application be and hereby is approved, 
Provided that the action so approved shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order

ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), the application of Fidelity American Bankshares, 
!nc., Lynchburg, Virginia ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding 
company, for the Board's prior approval of the acquisition of 80 per cent 
°r more of the voting shares of The Buchanan National Bank, Buchanan, 
Virginia ("Buchanan National"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
bitten notice of receipt of the application to the Comptroller of 
the Currency and requested his views and recommendation. The 
Comptroller recommended approval of the application. 

2100 
- 2 -
Notice of receipt of the application was published in 
the Federal Register on May 23, 1970 (35 Federal Register 7999), 
Providing an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
W a s forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
consideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired and 
all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect 
o f the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Upon 
such consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant controls two banks with aggregate deposits of 
million, representing 3.5 per cent of total bank deposits held by 
all commercial banks in the State of Virginia. (All banking data are 
a s of December 31, 1969, adjusted to reflect holding company formations 
an<* acquisitions approved by the Board to date.) The acquisition of 
^uchanan National (deposits $2 million) would increase Applicant's control 
deposits in the State by 0.03 per cent. Applicant has two concurrent 
aPPlications pending before the Board for the acquisition of The Bank 
o f Natural Bridge, Natural Bridge Station, Virginia (deposits $3 million), 
an<J Bank of Hampton Roads, Newport News, Virginia (deposits $19 million), 

2101 
- 3 -
the consummation of which would increase its deposits an additional 
per cent. After the acquisition of the three banks, Applicant 
would remain the smallest bank holding company and the eighth largest 
banking organization in the State. 
Buchanan National is the smaller of two banks located in 
Buchanan, Virginia, the fourth largest of five banks located in Botetourt 
County, and it controls 12 per cent of commercial bank deposits in the 
county. It is situated 45 miles from Applicant's nearest present sub-
sidiary, located in Lynchburg, Virginia, and it appears that no significant 
competition between Buchanan National and Applicant's present subsidiaries 
Would be eliminated by consummation of this proposal. As regards the 
Proposed subsidiaries, Buchanan National and The Bank of Natural Bridge are 
located 18 miles apart in contiguous counties, with no intervening banV.s. 
However, it appears that only a minimal overlap of business has developed 
because they serve separate areas with no established commuting patterns, 
and for this reason future competition between them is not projected. 
Bank of Hampton Roads, a third proposed affiliate of Applicant, located 
approximately 200 miles southeast of the Buchanan and Natural Bridge 
banks, does not compete with Buchanan National or The Bank of Natural Bridge. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse effect on competition 
in any relevant area. The banking factors as they pertain to Applicant 
and its subsidiaries are regarded as consistent with approval. Applicant's 

2102 
- 4 -
ability to furnish management succession to Buchanan National lends 
8ome weight toward approval of the application. Consummation of the 
proposal would enable Buchanan National to improve its services to the 
public by drawing on the resources of Applicant in such areas as increased 
lending capabilities, credit cards, trust services, and investment 
counseling; and these considerations lend some weight in favor of approval 
the application* It is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest, and that the application 
should be approved. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, for the reasons set forth above, that 
said application be and hereby is approved, provided that the acquisition 
so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar 
day following the date of this Order or (b) later than three months after 
fche date of this Order unless such period is extended for good cause by 
Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond pursuant to

There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to

or more of the voting shares of The Bank of Natural Bridge, Natural 
Bridge Station, Virginia ("Natural Bridge Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
written notice of receipt of the application to the Commissioner of 
Banking for the State of Virginia, and requested his views and recommendation. 
The Commissioner recommended approval of the application.

Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on May 22, 1970 (35 Federal Register 7912), providing 
an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and views 
vith respect to the proposal. A copy of the application was forwarded 
to the United States Department of Justice for its consideration. Time 
for filing comments and views has expired and all those received have

The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the Applicant and the banks concerned, 
and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Upon 
such consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant controls two banks with aggregate deposits of 
$249 million, representing 3.5 per cent of total bank deposits for the 
State of Virginia. 
(All banking data are as of December 31, 1969, 
adjusted to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved 
by 
the Board to date.) The acquisition of Natural Bridge Bank (deposits 
$3 million) would increase its control of deposits in the State by 
per cent. Applicant has two concurrent applications pending before 
the Board for the acquisition of The Buchanan National Bank, Buchanan, 
Virginia (deposits $2 million), and Bank of Hampton Roads, Newport News, 
Virginia (deposits $19 million), the consummation of which would increase 

2 1 { ) 5 
- 3 -
its deposits by an additional 0.3 per cent. After the acquisition of the 
three banks, Applicant would remain the smallest bank holding company 
and the eighth largest banking organization in the State. 
Natural Bridge Bank is the fifth largest of seven banks in 
Rockbridge County and controls 7 per cent of the commercial bank deposits 
in the county. Its only office is located in Natural Bridge Station, 
approximately three miles outside the town of Natural Bridge, and 
approximately 37 miles northwest of Lynchburg. The nearest office of 
Applicant's present subsidiaries is the Boonsboro Branch of The Fidelity 
National Bank in Lynchburg which is 32 miles from Natural Bridge. It 
appears that, because of the distance involved, consummation of the 
proposed acquisition would not eliminate any substantial amount of 
existing competition between Applicant's present subsidiaries and 
Natural Bridge Bank or foreclose potential competition between them. 
As regards the proposed subsidiaries, Natural Bridge Bank and The Buchanan 
National Bank are located 18 miles apart in contiguous counties, with no 
intervening banks. However, it appears that only a minimal overlap of 
business has developed because they serve separate areas with no 
established commuting patterns, and for this reason future competition 
between them is not projected. Bank of Hampton Roads, a third proposed 
affiliate of Applicant, is located approximately 200 miles southeast of 
the Natural Bridge and Buchanan banks, and does not compete with either 
of these banks.

There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to

the Board's prior approval of the acquisition of 100 per cent of the 
v°ting shares of a new insured nonmember bank into which would be merged 
Bank of Hampton Roads, Newport News, Virginia ("Hampton Bank"). The 
n ew insured nonmember bank has no significance except as a vehicle for 
accomplishing the acquisition of the bank to be merged into it; the 
Proposal is therefore treated herein as one to acquire shares of Hampton Bank.

As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written 
notice of receipt of the application to the Commissioner of Banking for 
fche State of Virginia and requested his views and recommendation. The 
Commissioner recommended approval of the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the

State of Virginia. 
(All banking data are as of December 31, 1969, 
adjusted to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved

*ould increase its control of deposits in the State by 0C27 per cent.

Applicant has two concurrent applications pending before the Board for 
the acquisition of The Buchanan National Bank, Buchanan, Virginia 
(deposits $2 million), and The Bank of Natural Bridge, Natural Bridge 
Station, Virginia (deposits $3 million), the consummation of which would 
increase its deposits by an additional 0.08 per cent. After the 
acquisition of the three banks, Applicant would remain the smallest 
hank holding company and the eighth largest banking organization in the State. 
Hampton Bank controls 7.6 per cent of total deposits in the 
Newport News-Hampton area, and is the fifth largest of 10 banking 
organizations operating therein. Applicant's closest present subsidiary 
is located in Portsmouth, a distance of about 16 miles. Because of the 
distances involving toll bridges and the presence of intervening banks, 
n° significant competition has developed or is likely to develop between 
the two banks. As regards the proposed subsidiaries, Hampton Bank is 
over 200 miles southeast of Applicant's two proposed affiliates, The 
Buchanan National Bank and The Bank of Natural Bridge, and does not 
compete with either of them. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the proposed acquisition would not have an adverse effect on competition 
in any relevant area. The banking factors as they pertain to Applicant 
and its subsidiaries are regarded as consistent with approval. Applicant's 
ability to furnish management succession to Hampton Bank lends some

area, and these considerations lend some weight in favor of approval

action would be in the public interest, and that the application should

Pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of 80 
Per cent or more of the voting shares of the following Florida banks: 
(!) Citizens Bank of Brevard, Melbourne ("Melbourne Bank"); (2) First 
National Bank of Satellite Beach, Satellite Beach ("Satellite Bank"); 
O ) First National Bank of Eau Gallie, Melbourne ("Eau Gallie Bank"); and 
(4) Indialantic Beach Bank, Indialantic ("Indialantic Bank"). 
Although each of the applications has been separately considered 
and is the subject of a separate Board Order, because of facts and 
circumstances common to the four applications, this Statement contains 
tl*e Board's findings and conclusions with respect to all four.

Views and recommendatjjons^f supervisory authorities. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, notice of receipt of the applications 
given to, and views and recommendations requested of, the Comptroller 
°f the Currency and the Florida Commissioner of Banking. The Comptroller 
and the Commissioner recommended approval of the respective applications 
Emitted to them. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
Monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
Monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part 
o f the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed acquisition 
the effect of which, in any section of the country, may be substantially 
t° lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any 
°ther manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds that 
the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly 
outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction 
In meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. In 
Gach case the Board ia required to take into consideration the financial 
Qtld managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company 
° n d the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities 
t o be served. 
Competitive effect of the proposed transactions. - Applicant, 
t h e second largest banking organization in Florida, controls five banks

which hold deposits of $798 million, or 6.5 per cent of total State 
deposits.1/ if all of the proposed acquisitions were approved Applicant 
would remain the State's second largest banking organization and would 
increase its control of State deposits to 6.7 per cent. 
The four banks involved are located in the coastal section of 
Brevard County. They are situated at their closest 2.3 miles apart and 
at their farthest 6 miles. 
All of Applicant's present subsidiaries are located over 140 miles 
from the market area involved, and none competes to any significant extent 
with any of the proposed subsidiaries. Further, it is unlikely that such 
competition would develop in the future. 
Two of the banks, Satellite Bank (deposits $8 million) and 
Indialantic Bank (deposits $4.7 million) are located on the beach portion 
°f Southern Brevard County, whereas the others are located on the mainland 
the opposite side of the mile wide Indian River. Melbourne Bank (deposits 
$5.8 million) and Indialantic Bank are located almost directly across from each 
other with a nearby causeway connecting the two areas, and a similar 
geographical relationship exists between Eau Gallie Bank (deposits $13 
m lHion) and Satellite Bank. 
In the area immediately affected (an eleven mile coastal section 
°f southern Brevard County), there are eight banks ranging in size from 
l.1 All banking data are as of December 31, 1969, adjusted to reflect holding 
company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board to date. 

£122

2»5 million to $30 million in deposits. These banks hold 42 per cent of 
county deposits. The four area banks not involved in the instant proposal 
are controlled by three bank holding companies. The four proposed 
subsidiaries control 31.5 per cent of deposits in the area; further, 
Satellite Bank and Indialantic Bank are the only banks in the beach 
area between Vero Beach and Cocoa Beach, 54 miles apart. Eau Gallie 
Bank and Melbourne Bank have identical service areas. Indialantic Bank 
Serves most of the same area, as well as the beach communities of 
Indialantic and Melbourne Beach. Satellite Bank serves a smaller area 
al°ng the beach side of the Indian River with almost no service area overlap. 
Management of Eau Gallie Bank organized Indialantic Bank in 1963, 
and the two banks have been closely related through a degree of common owner-
slliP and management since that time. Also>since its organization in 
l963, Satellite Bank and Melbourne Bank have been related through substantial 
common stock ownership and have cooperated closely. In 1969, Melbourne 
Bank was suffering financial difficulties because of a lack of capable 
Management, and was sold, along with Satellite Bank, to parties controlling 
other two banks. Thus, last year, the two pairs were joined under 
c°mmon control. Applicant states that the intent at that time was to 
f° r m a bank holding company and to liquidate the debt incurred to finance 
fch 
G acquisition of Melbourne Bank and Satellite Bank. These plans have not 
Materialized 
and the individuals involved have indicated a desire to dispose 
o f their recently acquired interests.

Therefore, although the relationship now existing between the two pairs 
°f banks precludes the existence of meaningful competition between them, 
the 
circumstances suggest that the relationship may not be permanent, 
and increase the likelihood of future competition. Approval of Applicant's 
acquisition of all four banks would foreclose that potential competition. 
This anticompetitive effect is compounded by the fact that such approval 
would perpetuate the near monopoly in the beach area. Under these cir-
cumstances, the Board does not believe that approval of all four of the 
proposed acquisitions would be justified, under the standards of the Act, 
absent the most compelling considerations bearing upon the convenience and 
needs of the communities involved. 
From the foregoing analysis, it is also clear that approval of 
any two of the applications involving Eau Gallie Bank, Melbourne Bank, 
and Indialantic Bank would involve similar detriment to competition, in 
view of the fact that all three serve essentially the same area. Of the 
three, competitive considerations weigh most strongly in favor of approval of 
proposal relating to Melbourne Bank. Acquisition of that bank by Appli-
cant would not only break the existing affiliation, but, with Applicant's 
guidance and support, that bank, which has not yet fully recovered from the 
e^fects of recent operational difficulties, could become a stronger competitor 
tl*an is otherwise likely. On the other hand, acquisition of Eau Gallie Bank, 
largest of the three, would deprive Melbourne Bank of a present source 
o f strength, thus making less likely its development as a strong competitor, 
while acquisition of Indialantic Bank would leave standing the existing 
filiation between Eau Gallie Bank and Melbourne Bank, which, based on 

2

their location, would otherwise be the most direct competitors. For these 
reasons, it is the Board's view that the application involving Melbourne 
Bank should be approved, and those with respect to Eau Gallie Bank and 
Indialantic Bank should be denied. 
The acquisition by Applicant of Satellite Bank, in addition to 
Melbourne Bank, would not involve serious anticompetitive effects. Not 
°nly is the overlap of the area served by Satellite Bank and Melbourne 
Bank much less significant than between Melbourne Bank and each of the other 
Proposed subsidiaries, but, as earlier noted, Satellite Bank has been 
closely related to Melbourne Bank since its organization. Moreover, pro-
competitive effects would result from acquisition of Satellite Bank, to 
the extent that it would become a competitor to Indialantic Bank for 
busines8 on the beach side of the Indian River. 
In summary, it is the Board's conclusion that approval of all 
^°ur applications would have the effect of substantially lessening future 
competition in the southern portion of Brevard County. However, acquisition 
Melbourne Bank and Satellite Bank would not only be procompetitive but 
°uid be most in the public interest because of its probable effect on the 
viabiiity and effectiveness of Melbourne Bank. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant's financial condition, management and prospects are regarded as 
satisfactory. These conditions also apply to the five subsidiary banks 
which Applicant has in operation. 
Eau Gallic's financial condition and management are generally 
tegarded as satisfactory, and its long-range prospects appear favorable.

The Board's action in splitting the two groups should have a favorable 
effect on Bank's executive management, which at present spreads its 
efforts among all four banks. 
The financial condition and management of Indialantic Bank 
a re satisfactory, and prospects are regarded as favorable. 
The financial condition of Melbourne Bank is regarded as only 
fair despite recent efforts toward improvement. The bank has asset weak-
nesses which its management, spread among the four subject banks, has not 
thus far fully corrected. These problems would receive appropriate atten-
tion under the strong management leadership which could be provided by 
Applicant, and Melbourne Bank's prospects would be improved thereby. 
The financial condition and management of Satellite Bank are 
reasonably satisfactory, although there are some asset weaknesses. While 
its prospects are not unfavorable, they would be significantly bettered 
under Applicant's ownership and direction. 
Considerations under these factors provide strong support for 
Applicant's proposal to acquire Melbourne Bank and some support toward 
fche approval of Satellite Bank. They provide less weight in favor of 
the acquisition of Eau Gallie Bank and Indialantic Bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - The 
c°nvenience and needs of customers located in areas served by Applicant's 
Present subsidiaries would not be affected by the proposed acquisition. 
The convenience and needs of the South Brevard market area 
aPpear to be adequately met by the four banks to be acquired and the three 
°ther existing banking organizations. However, the likely strengthening 
o f Melbourne Bank's operations under Applicant's control would enable it 
t o better serve its community. 

2 1 2 6 
The convenience and needs factors are consistent with approval 
°f all of the applications, but provide weight toward approval 
only with respect to the application involving Melbourne Bank. 
Summary and conclusion. - Based upon the foregoing, it appears 
that consummation of Applicant's proposed acquisition of Melbourne Bank and 
Satellite Bank would promote competition in the South Brevard area, and 
would lead to needed improvements in the financial and managerial condition 
°f the banks. Acquisition by Applicant of Eau Gallie Bank and Indialantic 
Bank, however, would have anticompetitive effects which are not outweighed 
by any other considerations. 
On the basis of all relevant facts contained in the record, and 
i n the light of the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, it is 
the Board's judgment that: 
1. The proposed acquisitions of Melbourne Bank and Satellite Bank 
Would be in the public interest and that those applications should be 
aPproved; 
2. The proposed acquisitions of Eau Gallie Bank and Indialantic 
Bank would not be in the public interest and those applications should be 
denied.

; 
5 217.150 Rate payable when higher rate is payable only on 
short-term deposits. 
The Board of Governors considers that the change in the 
Supplement; to Regulation Q, effective June 24, 1970, which permits 
tlle payment of interest at any rate on single maturity time deposits 
$100,000 or more with maturities of 30 to 89 days (while retaining 
the existing limitations on interest rates for such deposits maturing 
i n <J0 days or more), should be applied as follows: 
(a) A member bank may amend the rate paid on a $100,000 
c°rtificate with an original maturity of 30 to 89 days issued before 
une 24, 1970, to pay any interest rate for the period subsequent 
t o that date. 
(b) A member bank may not: amend the rate paid on a $100,000 
C G rtifi c a t c Wj_th an original maturity of 90 clays or more to pay interest 
hereon for any period at a rate in excess of that specified in the 
PPlement for such a deposit with the particular maturity. Since such 

a deposit is not a 30 to 89 day deposit; - the only kind of deposit 
tree fro;a interest rate control - it is not affected by the change 
in the regulation,. 
(c) A member bank may extend the maturity of a $100,000 
certificate which originally provided for a maturity of 30 to 89 
days, and pay interest at any rate during the extended term, if the 
new maturity is (1) later than the original maturity and (2) 30 to 
days from the date of the extension. 
(d) A member bank may not extend the term of a certificate 
°riginally issued for 90 days or more and pay interest on the deposit 
at a rate in excess of that applicable to the original deposit, even 
the new maturity meets the conditions in the preceding paragraph, 
does not apply, of course, to extension or icnewal at maturity. 
(e) A member bank may pay interest at any rate on a certifi-
cate originally issued in an amount less than $100,000 to which the 
depositor adds sufficient funds to increase the deposit to $100,000 
°r more, if and only if (1) the original maturity of the certificate 
is 30 to 89 days, and (2) the maturity date is 30 to 89 days after 
tlle date of the addition of such funds. 
(f) Member banks may not make use of contracts for future 
o 
epos its to permit a depositor to commit his funds for more than 89 
^ays and obtain interest at a rate in excess of that applicable to a 
deposit with a longer maturity. For example, a bank and its depositor 

2129 
-3-
micht agree on August 1, 1970 that the depositor will deposit, on 
that date and again on October 20 (80 days later), $100,000 for 
days, on which the bank will pay interest at the rate of 10 per-
cent. Such an arrangement would be an effort to evade the purposes 
the Regulation, which permits payment of rates of interest 
Without legal restriction only on deposits of 30 to 89 days. The 
Board considers that the substance of such a transaction would be 
a deposit for 160 days. 
(If the depositor lias an option, by contract 
0 r understanding, Lo withdraw funds at the end of the first 80 days 
°r to leave them on deposit for the second 80 days, the deposit would 
subject to the limitations of the Supplement to Regulation Q 
QPplicable to multiple maturity deposits payable at intervals of 
*Gss than 90 days.) The Board's view would be the same even though 
tlie agreements - formal or informal - were entered into at different 
tim.es, if they were so related as to be, in reality, a single arrange-
