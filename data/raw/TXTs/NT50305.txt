First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 of the Federal Re-
serve Act, to establish a branch in London, England, and to operate and 
maintain such branch subject to the provisions of such Section and of 
Regulation M. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for busi-
ness on or before August 1, 1969, all rights granted hereby shall be 
deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted will 
automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago, when the branch is opened for business, fur-
nishing information as to the exact location of the branch. The Board 
should also be promptly informed of any future change in location of 
the branch in London. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, funds 
provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated capital, 
advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign assets for pur-
Poses of the foreign credit restraint effort. In view of the Board's 
concern with minimizing the impact of foreign investments on the bal-
ance of payments, the above consent is given with the understanding 
that in the conduct of the branch's operations, maximum reliance will 
b e placed on resources obtained outside the United States. Accordingly, 
it is understood that any investment required will be made within the 
guidelines established under the foreign credit restraint effort now 
in' 
effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities 
your bank, and that due consideration is being given to the priori-
ties contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Gentlemen: 
In 
response to your request received under cover of a 
letter dated April 8, 1968, to Vice President Campbell, Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Board of Governors grants con-
sent for your wholly-owned subsidiary, New World Development Corpora-
tion ("NWDC"), to purchase and hold approximately 150 additional 
shares of Deutsch-Iberoamerikanische Entwicklungs-Aktiengesellschaft, 
Frankfurt, Germany, at a cost of approximately $37,500. 
Your attention is drawn to the provision of the guide-
lines for banks under the foreign credit restraint program which 
requests that no new nonexport credits be made to developed coun-
tries of continental Western Europe. In accordance with that pro-
vision, the Board would regard the use of the capital funds of NWDC, 
°r other funds obtained by NWDC from residents of the United States 
f°r the purpose of making loans and investments in developed coun-
tries of continental Western Europe as not being consistent with the 
guidelines. It is understood that arrangements have already been 
roade for obtaining" funds for the proposed investment from sources 
outside of the United States. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal
