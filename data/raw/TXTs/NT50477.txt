Foreign banking matters. 
Unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to Continental International Finance Corporation, Chicago, 
Illinois, granting consent to continue to hold shares of Continental 
Development Bank, Beirut, Lebanon, subsequent to the establishment 
by the latter of a branch in Dubai, Trucial State of Dubai. A copy 
is attached as Item N o . 1. 
Unanimous approval was given to a letter to First National 
t 
City Overseas Investment Corporation, New Y o r k , New York, granting 
permission to acquire the shares of First National City Development 
Finance Corporation, Bangkok, Thailand, and shares of Bangkok 
Investment Company, Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand. 
A copy is attached as 
Item N o . 2. 
Unanimous approval was given to a letter to First National 
City Bank, New Y o r k , New Y o r k , granting permission to acquire stock 
of Banco de Comercio e Industria de Guatemala, S.A., Guatemala City, 
Guatemala.

Report on competitive factors. 
A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of First National B a n k , 
Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and First National Bank & Trust Co., 
Washington, Pa., Washington, Pennsylvania, was approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. 
The conclusion 
read as follows: 
There is little or no existing competition between First 
National Bank, Charleroi, and First National Bank & Trust Co., 
Washington, Pa.; however, there is some potential for develop-
ment of competition between them. 
Both banks are now in direct 

21 
t 
6/27/69

competition with branches of substantially larger banks, 
and upon consummation of this proposal, the resulting 
bank might be a more effective competitor. 
The overall 
competitive effect would be slightly adverse. 
Communications system. 
Unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stating that the 
Board agreed to comply with applicable provisions of an agreement 
entered into between the Bank and Western Union Telegraph Company 
for the provision of terminal equipment, circuit terminal equipment, 
and support services incident to the new Federal Reserve communica-
tions system, and to prepare the sites at the Board for installation 
of terminal equipment and circuit terminal equipment. 
A copy of the 
letter is attached as Item No. 4. 
Truth in lending. 
After discussion, unanimous approval was 
given to a letter to the Acting Bank Commissioner of the State of 
Maine explaining that the Board was not in a position to grant to 
the State an interim exemption from the requirements of the Federal 
truth in lending law, but that the Board expected to promulgate shortly 
a supplement to its Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, under which it 
would consider requests from States for exemptions, and that the 
request of the State of Maine for such an exemption would then be 
Processed under the terms of that supplement. 
A copy of the letter 
is attached as Item No. 5. 
Bank loans on life insurance policies. 
The Board considered 
a proposed reply to a request from Congressman Patman for information 

2 1 2 3 
6/27/69 
-4-
about bank loans "collateralized by questionable insurance policies." 
Several questions were raised with regard to the sufficiency of the 
information proposed to be supplied, and in the circumstances the 
matter was held over with a request that the staff endeavor to obtain 
additional information. 
Israel Discount Bank. 
The Board considered a memorandum from 
the Legal Division dated June 26, 1969, with regard to a request from 
the Israel Discount Bank for a ruling under the Bank Holding Company 
Act and, after discussion of several questions raised in that connec-
tion, approved unanimously a letter in the form attached as Item N o . 6. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Reserve Bank officer salaries. 
Unanimous approval was given 
to letters to the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, St. Louis, and 
San Francisco approving the payment of salaries to specified officers, 
including certain new appointees, at 
annual rates fixed by the directors 
of the respective Banks. 
Copies of the letters are attached as Items 7-
9 y inclusive. 
Investment Bankers Association. 
It was agreed to extend an 
invitation to members of the Government Borrowing Committee of the 
Investment Bankers Association to meet with available members of the 
Board and appropriate staff on Tuesday, July 29, 1969. 
Labor Relations Panel. Mr. O'Connell reported to the Board 
concerning communications received from a union official citing alleged 

2129 
a 
6/27/69 
-5-
unfair labor practices on the part of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco, the telegram of acknowledgment sent over Governor 
Sherrill's name, and subsequent conversations with officials of the 
Reserve Bank. 
Mr. O'Connell said it was Governor Sherrill's recommendation 
that action be taken to name the members of the System Labor 
Relations Panel provided for in the Board's recent policy statement 
on labor relations. 
After some discussion, Governors Mitchell and Sherrill were 
named as the members of the Board to serve on the Panel, and it was 
agreed that efforts to develop a list of persons who might be con-
sidered for the post of public member of the Panel would be undertaken 
upon the return of Governor Sherrill. 
Proposed survey of capital spending. Mr. Holland referred to 
a telephone call received from President Hickman of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Cleveland with regard to a question raised by a source within 
the Administration as to whether the Reserve Banks would undertake a 
survey of selected corporations within their respective districts with 
respect to capital spending intentions. President Hickman, while 
favorably inclined, inquired regarding any views that might be held as 
to procedures that should appropriately be followed in dealing with 
this request. 
In discussion, it was noted that surveys of this kind had 
typically been conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

2130 
6/27/69 
-6-
and the Department of Commerce. 
It was also mentioned that a survey 
such as proposed might have to be cleared with the Bureau of the 
Budget. 
It was the consensus that President Hickman should be advised 
to proceed as he saw fit within the Fourth District, but that any 
request to the other Reserve Banks to participate in such a survey 
should be issued through the Board's offices. It was understood that 
the Board's staff would pursue the matter with the office where the 
request had originated and that the staff could tender the information 
recently obtained on the same subject in response to a Board letter 
to the Chairmen of the Reserve Banks in order to determine whether such 
information would be helpful and perhaps be considered sufficient to 
obviate the need for the requested survey. 
Personnel matters. 
Following up on yesterday's general approval 
of proposed officer assignments within the Division of Research and 
Stat istics, the Board approved the promotion of Peter M . Keir, pre-
sently Assistant Adviser, to the rank of Associate Adviser, effective 
June 30, 1969, with annual salary at the rate of $28,500, and approved 
the appointment of Joseph C. Zeisel, presently Chief of the National 
Income, Labor Force, and Trade Section, as Assistant Adviser, also 
effective June 30, 1969, with annual salary at the rate of $28,000. 
The Board also approved the naming of J. Charles Partee and 
Kenneth B. Williams as members of the Editorial Committee of the 
Federal Reserve Bulletin. 

6/27/69

In addition, the Board approved the payment of salary to 
Donald E . Anderson, Project Representative in the Annex Building 
Construction function, at the annual rate of $21,000 effective 
July 13, 1969. 
Regular salary schedule. 
As indicated by Governor Sherrill 
at yesterday's meeting, the Division of Personnel Administration 
had furnished a memorandum under that date proposing a general 
adjustment of the Board's regular salary schedule effective July 13, 
1969, and making certain related recommendations with regard to 
implementation of the proposal. 
The recommendations in the memorandum, a copy of which is 
attached as Item N o . 10, were approved unanimously. 
The Board's 
action included approval of any resulting overexpenditures in the 
pertinent accounts of the 1969 Board budget. 
Money market review. Members of the research divisions 
entered at this point and presented the usual weekly money market 
review, including a report on gold and foreign exchange markets, 
with special reference to developments in the wake of the announce-
ment yesterday of the Board's proposal to impose a marginal reserve 
requirement against Euro-dollar borrowings by U . S . banks, and reports 
on the Government securities market and bank credit developments. 
Copies of the statistical materials prepared for today's review 

6/27/69

and of the foreign briefing have been placed in the Board's 
files. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
In accordance with the request contained in your letters 
of April 21, 1969, the Board of Governors grants consent for your 
Corporation ("FNCOIC") to purchase and hold all of the shares of 
First National City Development Finance Corporation ("FNCDFC") and 
50 per cent of the shares of Bangkok Investment Company, Ltd. ("BICL"), 
both to be established in Bangkok, Thailand, at a cost of approximately 
$1,000,000 and $2,500,000, respectively, provided the shares are 
acquired and 25 per cent paid for within one year from the date of 
this letter. 
In this connection, approval is also granted for the 
purchase arid holding of shares of FNCDFC and BICL in excess of 1.0 per 
cent of your Corporation's capital and surplus. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and holding 
of shares of BICL by FNCOIC is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) 
That FNCOIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in BICL if BICL at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, 
with the consent of the Board of Governors, purchase 
and hold stock, or if BICL establishes any branch or 
agency or takes any action or undertakes any operation 
in Thailand or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to FNCOIC; 
(2) 
That, when required by the Board of Governors, FNCOIC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of BICL as it may require from time 
to time; and 
(3) 
That any share acquisitions or dispositions by BICL be 
reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if BICL were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve A c t .

of shares of FNCDFC by FNCOIC is granted subject to the same condi-
tions prescribed in the immediately preceding paragraph with respect 
to the shares of BICL, except for the substitution of "FNCDFC" for 
"BICL" where BICL appears. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board

national Banking Corporation, and First National City Bank (Inter-
national), and that due consideration is being given to the priorities 
contained therein.

letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed holding of shares of 
Banco by FNCB is granted subject to the following conditions: 
< 
(1) 
That such shares be disposed of as promptly as

will furnish the Board with such reports regarding

Dear Mr. Heflin: 
This acknowledges your letter of June 3, 1969, 
summarizing the current status of the new Federal Reserve 
Communications System and enclosing a copy of Agreement 
entered into on May 16, 1969, between the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Richmond and the Western Union Telegraph Company 
for the provision of Terminal Equipment, Circuit Terminal 
Equipment, and support services. Relative to the afore-
said Agreement, and pursuant to the provisions thereof, 
you have requested that the Board transmit its agreement 
to comply with applicable provisions of Articles X and XV 
of the Agreement. 
The Board hereby agrees to comply with all 
applicable provisions of Articles X and XV of the afore-
said Agreement and, upon receipt of necessary information 
from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, agrees to 
prepare the sites at the Board for installation of 
Terminal Equipment and Circuit Terminal Equipment.

Mr. Irl E . Withee 
Acting Bank Commissioner

State of Maine

Dear Mr 0 Withee: 
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 20, 
1969, requesting an interim exemption from the requirements of the 
Federal Truth in Lending law pending a more formal determination 
after the Board has promulgated its final draft of Supplement II. 
The Board is not in a position to issue an interim exemp-
tion, for under the law it must proceed "by regulation," and it may 
exempt any class of transactions from the requirements of Chapter II 
of the Truth in Lending Act ". . . if it determines that under the 
law of that State that class of transactions is subject to require-
ments substantially similar to those imposed under this chapter, and 
that there is adequate provision for enforcement." 
The Board is 
not in a position to make a determination regarding any class of 
transactions within any State until it has adopted suitable regulations. 
It is anticipated that this will be accomplished through the promul-
gation of Supplement II to Regulation Z about July 1, 1969. 
Thereafter, 
the Board must analyze carefully the applicable State statutes and 
regulations and determine that they are, in fact, substantially 
similar to the Federal requirements and that there is adequate pro-
vision for enforcement. 
We are aware of the provision in your Act which suspends 
its effective date until an exemption from the Federal statute is 
obtained. 
Certainly, it is not our desire to have you terminate your 

M r . Irl E . Withee 
- 2 -
enforcement staff and then attempt to reconstruct it if a Federal 
exemption is granted. 
However, during the reasonably short time 
which we anticipate will be needed to make a determination, we 
understand that you will be able to utilize your field staff in 
various examination and enforcement functions of your office. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

AIR MAIL 
George M . Shapiro, Esquire, 
Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn, 
300 Park Avenue, 
New York, New York. 
10022 
Dear M r . Shapiro: 
This is in response to your request for a Board ruling 
with respect to the applicability of the Bank Holding Company Act of 
1956 to a situation involving Israel Discount Bank Limited ("ID Bank"), 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, IDB Trust Company, and a closely-owned 
corporation in Israel ("Familyco") which owns more than 25 per cent of 
the voting shares of Israel Discount Bank. 
Your letter of June 21, 1969 indicates that ID Bank is an 
Israel banking corporation which operates 116 branches in Israel and 
also has two branches in New York City, which accept demand deposits. 
Because such branches of a foreign bank are ineligible for Federal 
deposit insurance and are inhibited by provisions of New York law from 
rendering full trust services, ID Bank recently acquired all of the 
shares of an existing bank chartered by the State of New York. 
That 
bank, the name of which has been changed to IDB Trust Company, is 
scheduled to open on July 1, 1969 in new quarters located in the build-
ing that houses the principal New York City branch of ID Bank. 
IDB 
Trust Company does not presently accept demand deposits, but proposes 
to begin doing so on July 1. Since Familyco directly owns over 25 per 
cent of the voting shares of ID Bank, and indirectly owns all of the 
shares of IDB Trust Company, that corporation would be within the defi-
nition of "bank holding company" set forth in section 2(a) of the Act 
if both ID Bank and IDB Trust Company are regarded as "banks" within 
the meaning of section 2(c). 
A "bank" is defined by section 2(c) to mean "any institution 
that accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw 
on demand, but shall not include any organization . . . that does not 

George M . Shapiro, Esquire 
- 2 -
do business within the United States." 
Applying that definition to 
the present situation, it appears that a foreign bank which, like ID 
Bank, has offices in the United States which accept demand deposits, 
is covered by the definition, and the Board has previously so held. 
Since IDB Trust Company does not presently accept demand deposits, it 
is not a "bank" within the meaning of the Act. At such time as it does 
begin accepting demand deposits, however, it will be within the defi-
nition. 
Therefore, unless prior to that time the Board approves an 
application by Familyco to become a bank holding company, a violation 
of section 3(a)(1) of the Act will have occurred. 
The Board has considered your contention that ID Bank and 
IDB Trust Company should be regarded as a single institution, and thus 
a single bank, for purposes of the Act, but is unable to reconcile such 
a construction with the terms or purposes of the Act. While it might 
be argued that a single banking "operation" is involved, it is impossible 
to overlook the separate corporate status of the two institutions, espe-
cially in the light of the different legal powers inherent in that separate 
status, so as to conclude that a single institution is involved. 
With regard to the intent of Congress in enacting the statute, 
the Board is unable to agree that the fact that the Act was adopted in 
1956 indicates that no consideration was given to the status of branches 
of foreign banks, which, you state, were not in existence at that time. 
The definition of "bank" in the present section 2(c) is not the same as 
that contained in the Act as originally enacted, but was adopted by 
amendment to the Act in 1966, six years after the passage of the New York 
legislation which permitted foreign banks to establish branches in that 
State. Moreover, while it is certainly true that the legislation was 
not principally directed at foreign banks, the fact that Congress specif-
ically excluded from the definition "any organization that does not do 
business within the United States" indicates an intention to encompass 
foreign banking organizations which accept demand deposits in this country. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Board has declined to grant the 
ruline which you requested. 
In so doing, the Board is cognizant of the 
consequent disruption in IDB Trust Company's plans to commence accepting 
demand deposits on July 1, and wishes to assure you that any application 
which Familyco might file under the Bank Holding Company Act in order to 
remedy the situation will be acted upon as expeditiously as possible, 
consistent with the provisions of the Act and with the Board's responsi-
bilities thereunder. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Robert P . Forrestal

Dear M r . Morris: 
The Board of Governors approves the appointment of, 
and the payment of salaries to, officers of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston listed below for the period July 1 through

Subject: 
General Adjustment to the 
fom Division of Personnel Administration 
Board's Regular Salary Schedule 
The Federal Salary Act of 1967, Public Law 90-206, provided 
implementation of comparability of Federal civilian employees' salaries 
with rates paid in private enterprises, to be accomplished by three 
adjustments effective in October 1967, July 1968, and July 1969. 
The 
first two adjustments were accomplished on schedule. On June 16, 
President Nixon signed an Executive Order to effect the final phase of 
the three-part adjustment, effective with the first full pay period on 
or after July 1, 1969. The Executive Order provides a percentage in-
crease ranging from 3.0 to 10.3. It does not provide for any increase 
at the Grade 1 level. 
Re c ommend a t i on 
In keeping with the Board's policy of maintaining its employees' 
salary structure comparable to that of other agencies of the Federal Gov-
ernment, it is recommended that the Board approve the attached revision of 
its Regular Salary Schedule, effective July 13, 1969, which is identical 
with the revised Government General Schedule, with the exception of Grade 1 
which provides for a one step increase, approximately 3 percent. 
In connection with the implementation of this recommendation, the 
following administrative procedures are recommended, as in similar pay 
schedule changes in the past: 
(1) With the approval of the Board Member in charge of 
internal administrative affairs, the Division of 
Personnel Administration shall be responsible for 
making appropriate adjustments in the per diem and 
hourly rates of the WAE (when actually employed) 
employees, etc. 
(2) The Office of the Controller and the Division of 
Personnel Administration will use Government regu-
lations and interpretations as guides in deciding 
questions of administration and procedures. 
The Controller's Office recommends approval of any over-expenditures 
in the 1969 Salary and Employee Retirement and Insurance Benefits budgetary 
accounts resulting from approval of this proposal.

Exceptions 
According to newspaper reports, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
figures indicate that the current pay line for Grade GS-1 exceeds that for 
comparable private industry jobs. 
Nevertheless, the Civil Service Com-
mission and the Bureau of the Budget recommended a three percent increase 
for employees in Grade G S - 1 . 
However, because the current adjustments to 
the General Schedule are to arrive at comparability, the Comptroller 
General has ruled that any increase approved for Grade GS-1 employees 
would be in violation of the comparability pay law. 
The comparability pay law does not apply to the Board's salary 
administration. 
Therefore, it is recommended that each employee be given 
the equivalent of a one step increase, i.e., $130 or about 3 percent. 
This 
would be accomplished by increasing each of the present steps by $130. 
In 
this m a n n e r , employees would retain their progress increase date. 
The re-
sult will be a starting rate for FR-1 positions of $4,019 (rather than 
$3,889), which would be equitable to new hires. 
About 12 employees currently in Grade FR-1 would benefit from 
this adjustment. 
It is also recommended that the following employees under the 
Prevailing Rate Wage Schedule receive adjustments of $130 each: 
Ruth Ellis 
Cafeteria Helper 
Valeria Faina 
Charwoman 
Ruth Flowers 
Charwoman 
John C . Simmons 
Laborer 
Viola E . Mruk 
Charwoman 
Frances E . Willis 
Charwoman 
These employees were placed in saved rates, effective May 18, 
1969, when their Sections voted to change from the FR schedule to a Wage 
Board system. 
The increase will give them the amount they would have 
received had the majority decision not resulted in saved rates for them. 
Otherwise, no salary rate adjustments are included in this recom-
mendation for Board employees paid under the Metropolitan D. C . Prevailing 
Rate Wage Schedule (mechanics, gardeners, painters, chauffeurs, laborers, 
cafeteria helpers, etc.) or the Interdepartmental Lithographic Wage Board 
Pay Schedule (offset press operators, mimeograph operators, etc.). 
These 
employees receive periodic salary adjustments (usually in November) as a 
result of annual wage surveys.
