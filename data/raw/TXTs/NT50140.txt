Gentlemen* 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
approves the establishment by Depositors Trust Company, Augusta, 
Maine, of a branch on the east side of the Kennebec River, off 
the Rotary Traffic Circle, across from Cony High School, Augusta, 
Maine, provided the branch is established within one year from 
the date of this letter. 
As noted in a letter to President Haselton dated August 30, 
1967, your bank's capital position is to be carefully reviewed at 
the time of the next examination. In approving this branch, con-
sideration has been given to your bank's satisfactory management, 
and it has been determined that the proposed branch will serve the 
convenience and needs of the community and that establishment of 
the branch will not tend to create an undesirable competitive 
situation. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L. Carmichael

Assistant Secretary.
