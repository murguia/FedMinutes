Pursuant to recommendations by the Division of Federal Reserve

Birmingham, Jacksonville, Nashville, and New Orleans). 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Capital National Corporation. 
In a memorandum of May 30, 1972, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of the 

1542 
6/16/72 
-2-
application of Capital National Corporation, Houston, Texas, to acquire 
shares of Northwest National Bank, also of Houston. The Banking Markets 
Section also recommended approval. Other documentation brought out 
that although the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had recommended denial, 
it did not feel strongly about the application. 
Discussion indicated a view that the draft order that had been 
Prepared reflecting the staff's favorable recommendation should state 
ttore fully information relating to expected improvements in the capital 
Position of the holding company's present bank subsidiary. 
The application was approved unanimously and issuance of an 
order in the form attached as Item No. 10 was authorized. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Same-day substitution. On June 13, 1972, the Board discussed 
Pending proposals, which had been published for comment in April 1972, 
to limit the use of the same-day substitution privilege in margin accounts 
under Regulations G, T, and U, relating to credit for securities trans-
itions. Action was deferred pending the outcome of a conference the 
Board's staff expected to hold with representatives of the securities 
indus try. 
In a memorandum of June 15 the Division of Research and Statistics 
and the Division of Supervision and Regulation submitted a new draft of 
regulatory amendments reflecting suggestions received during the conference. 

1543 
6/16/72 
-6-
The staff also proposed an amendment to Regulation T to permit short sales 
of convertible securities on the same terms as short sales of stock. This 
amendment had been published for comment a year ago, and adoption was 
considered necessary to alleviate technical problems. 
In essence, the industry group had made two proposals during 
the conference. The first would minimize operational problems involved 
in setting up a sliding scale for selecting the accounts that would forfeit 
the same-day substitution privilege. The staff recommended adoption of 
that proposal, and the revised draft of amendments embodied it. The second 
Proposal called for adoption by the Board of a formula under which the 
margin status of the accounts selected would have to be somewhat improved 
if a same-day substitution took place, but the customer would still retain 
Part of the advantage he at present enjoyed when he made such a substi-
tution. The staff did not believe that this proposal was in accord with 
the Board's objectives, and did not recommend it. 
While different in form, the draft proposal for establishing a 
sliding scale of margin accounts according to their margin status was 
based on the same criteria as used in the earlier draft amendments, except 
that a different method was provided for calculating the status of the 
account. The method now proposed, which was described in a paper attached 
to the memorandum, would be operationally simpler, but its net effect 
would be somewhat more restrictive than that of the original proposal. 
During explanation of technical aspects of the margin status 
measurement contemplated earlier and that now proposed, the staff brought 

1544 
6/16/72 
-2-
out that although the method now recommended was somewhat more lenient 
with respect to certain individual accounts, it would have the effect 
of bringing substantially more accounts within the coverage of the 
limitations. 
It was therefore recommended that the revised proposals 
be published for comment, since they would affect a fairly large number 
of people who had not previously been put on notice. It was suggested 
that a short time be allowed for comments and that the announcement 
indicate that the Board expected to adopt the amendments on the revised 
basis at a specified time after the announcement. The staff indicated 
also that it did not recommend a suggestion by the industry representatives 
that the same-day substitution privilege be denied only to accounts in 
which debt represented more than 70 per cent of market value of stock 
collateral rather than 60 per cent as the Board's proposals contemplated. 
Other comments referred to the need to minimize back-office problems at 
brokerage houses. 
In the ensuing discussion, members of the Board expressed the 
understanding that this was merely the first of several anticipated 
steps in tightening the use of the same-day substitution privilege. There 
was general agreement to retain the 60 per cent cut-off for this step. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the Board unanimously approved 
Publishing the revised proposals for comments to be received by a short 
deadline and with an indication that the Board expected to adopt the 
revised proposals in approximately 30 days after that deadline. Attached 
under Item No. 11 are copies of the press release announcing this action, 
along with the proposed amendments.

All members of the staff then withdrew except Messrs. Holland, 
Melnicoff, Smith, R. Solomon, and Bryant. 
Governor Daane reported on a recent meeting of foreign central 
bankers in Basle, and Mr. Solomon reported on the working group meeting 
held simultaneously in Paris. 
Officer salary. The Board unanimously approved Governor Sheehan's 
recommendation that the salary of Mrs. Pauline B. Heller, Assistant 
General Counsel, Legal Division, be increased to an annual rate of $31,750, 
effective immediately. 
The meeting then adjourned.

New York, Â«ew York 10005 
Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letters of April 14 and 21, 1972, the 
Board of Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("WFBI'1) to 
cÂ°ntinue to hold the shares of Wells Fargo International Investment 
Corporation ("WFI1C") after WFIIC acquires all of the shares of Wells 
1?arg0 Assessoria Financiera Ltda. ("WFAF11) , Sao Paulo, Brazil, at a 
cost of approximately Cr$600,000 (about $100,000), provided $25,000 
is invested in the shares within one year from the date of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed indirect purchase and 
holding of shares of WFAF by WFBI is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) That WFBI shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in WFAF if WFAF at any time 
fails to restrict its activities to those per-
missible to a corporation in which a corporation 
organized under Section 2 5(a) of the Federal Re-
serve Act could, with the consent of the Board of 
Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if WFAF 
establishes any branch or agency or takes any ac-
tion or undertakes any operation in Brazil or else-
where, in any manner, which at the time would not 
be permissible to WFBI; 
<r> That, when required by the Board of Governors, WFBI 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of WFAF as it may require from time 
to time; and 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by WFAF 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K 
in the same manner as if WFAF were a corporation or-
ganized under Section 2 5(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. 

1552 
To: Wells Fargo Bank International 
-2-
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as they 
relate to restrictions on loans granted by WFAF in Brazil in the cur-
*-cr>cv of that country. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
ICEWANEE INVESTING CO??ANY 
Order Approving Action to Become a Bank Holding Company 
Kex^anee Investing Company, ICewanee, Illinois, has applied 
the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) to become a bank holding company through 
acquisition of 60,04 per cent of the voting shares of ICewanee National 
Bar*k, ICewanee, Illinois ("Bank'1). 
Notice of receipt of the application has been given in 
accordance with Â§ 3(b) of the Act, and the time for filing comments 
arid views has expired. The Board has considered the application and 
comments received in the light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) 
o f the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
\ 
Applicant is a newly organized corporation formed for the 
\ 
Purpose of acquiring the assets and assuming the liabilities of ICewanee 
Investing Company, an Iowa corporation that is a registered bank holding 
cÂ°ropany presently holding 60.04 per cent of the voting shares of Bank 
($5 million of deposits as of June 30, 1^71), the smaller of two banks 
the city of ICewanee. The proposed transaction is essentially a 
cÂ°rporate reorganization in which the ownership of Bank will be trans-
from an Iowa corporation to an Illinois corporation with the same 
stÂ°ckholders. Applicant states that the reason for the reorganization 
i s to facilitate the obtaining of additional capital at minimum cost. 
CÂ°^summation of the proposal would not alter existing banking competition 
nÂ°r 3ignificantiy affect potential competition; nor does it appear that 
fcWe would be any adverse effects on any bank in the relevant area. 

1554 
As a result of consummation of the proposal, Applicant will 
assume a large debt nox-7 held by the Iox/a corporation. The size of 
the debt to be transferred to Applicant is of serious concern to the 
T3Â°ard. However, Applicant states that it proposes to raise additional 
CaPital through a stock issue; and it appears that the change in the 
Elding company's state of incorporation to the State of Illinois would 
a reduction of the debt since the cost of raising additional 
capital through the intrastate sale of equity securities should be substan-
tially i e s s than if the holding company remained an Iowa corporation, 
^he prospect of an early reduction of the holding company's debt lends 
some weight toward approval of the application. 
No immediate benefits to convenience and needs of the community 
t o be served will result from the consummation of Applicant's proposal, 
however, the improved financial condition of Applicant which is projected 
after the infusion of additional capital and its ability as an Illinois 
CorPoration 
to raise capital more easily for the Bank if the need should 
arise should enhance Bank's financial condition, and improve its ability 
to serve the banking needs of its area. Considerations relating to 
convenience 
and needs are regarded as consistent with approval of the 
aPPUcation. 
It is the Board's judgment that the application should 
app r o v ed. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
^a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 

1555 
-3-
this Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
EXCHANGE BANCORPORATION, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Exchange Bancorporation, Inc., Tampa, Florida, a bank holding 
CÂ°mPany within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
fÂ°r the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) 
tr\ 
acquire 80 per cent or more of the voting shares of Citizens Bank of 
Clettnont, Clermont, Florida ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
5 3(b) of the Act, The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
an<1 the Board has considered the application and all comments received 
in light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(C)). 
Applicant, the tenth largest of twenty-three multibank holding 
in Florida, controls seven banks with aggregate deposits of 
^16,8 million, representing 2.15 per cent of the total deposits in 
Cotomercial banks in Florida."'' Applicant's acquisition of Bank (deposits 
fN-C 
million) would increase Applicant's share of Statewide deposits 
by n , 
Â°nly .08 percentage points. 
Bank is the fourth largest of five banks in the South Lake 
p 
Â°Unty banking market, controlling 14.35 per cent of deposits in that 
^ 
All banking data are as of June 30, 1971, adjusted to reflect holding 
mPany formations and acquisitions to date. 

1557 
-2~ 
^ k e t . No existing nor significant potential competition between Bank 
and any of Applicant's existing subsidiary banks would be eliminated upon 
cÂ°nsummation of this proposal because of Florida's restrictive branching 
laws and the distance of 32 miles which separate Bank and Applicant's 
nea*"est subsidiary banking office. On the basis of the record, the Board 
cÂ°nsiders that consummation of the proposal would not adversely affect 
competition in any relevant area nor would any competing bank be adversely 
affected. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects of 
^pPlicant, its subsidiary banks and Bank are generally satisfactory and 
cÂ°nsistent with approval. In addition, it is expected that Bank's affilia-
te n with Applicant will help Bank develop a more stable and prudent 
^anagement. Applicant will incur substantial debt in acquiring Bank. 
Hn 
Â°wever, Applicant has assured the Board that it will promptly retire 
debt from the proceeds of a public offering of securities to be 
is 
such 
8Ued shortly. In light of Applicant's assurances, the Board does not 
Â°Usider the debt involved significant enough to bar approval of this 
PvÂ°Posal. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
0Rllnunity to be served lend weight toward approval of the application, 
Sin 
e Applicant proposes to offer "through Bank, trust, travel and inter-
J-Â°nal banking services that are not presently available in Bank's 
It is the Board s judgment that the proposed acquisition would be 
^ e public interest and that the application should be approved.

On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
tlle reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
THE ROYAL TRUST COMPANY 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
The Royal Trust Company, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, has 
aPplied for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(1) of the Bank Hold-
in8 Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank hold-
ing company through acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares 
(less directors' qualifying shares) of the successor by merger to 
Inter National Bank of Miami, Miami, Florida ("Bank"). The bank 
into which Bank is to be merged has no significance except as a 
means to facilitate the acquisition of voting shares of Bank. 
Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of shares of the successor 
Â°rganization is treated herein as the proposed acquisition of 
shares of Bank, 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given 
accordance with Â§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing com-
ments and views has expired, and none has been timely received, 
^ e Board has considered the application in light of the factors 
forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant with total assets of $1.6 billion!/ is the 
latgest trust company in Canada, also operating through sub-
diaries and other interests, in Great Britain, Ireland, the 
Channel Islands, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and 
Hebrides. Applicant engages principally in trust and real

estate financing activities outside of the United States. Con-
summation of the proposed transaction therefore would not eliminate 
anY existing competition in the United States. 
Bank, with deposits of close to $43 million,!/ is the 
nineteenth largest of the 75 banks located in Dade County, Florida, 
the relevant banking market, and holds 1.26 per cent of the total 
amount of deposits in commercial banks located in that market. 
Since Applicant is not considered to be a likely potential entrant 
into the Dade County banking market other than by the proposed 
Qcqulsition of Bank, consummation of that transaction is unlikely 
t o have an adverse effect upon potential competition. Rather, it 
aPpears that consummation of the proposal may promote competition 
in that an affiliation of Bank with Applicant should strengthen 
^nk'a ability to compete in a market, a substantial proportion 
o f which is controlled by the largest bank holding company in 
F l oUda. 
The financial and managerial resources and future 
Prospects of Applicant and Bank are consistent with approval of 
t h e application, especially in view of the fact that the proposal 
h a s been structured in such a manner that, upon consummation of 
t h e transaction, Bank's capital and surplus will be increased by 
and outstanding convertible debentures in the sum of 
^Â°0,000 will be either converted to capital stock or redeemed, 
shareholders of Bank are to be accorded equal treatment.

Although the banking needs of the Dade County community are being 
Served adequately by existing institutions, consummation of the 
Proposed transaction should have a beneficial effect on the con-
silience and needs of that community in that Applicant intends 
to utilize its trust expertise in the establishment of a trust 
department in Bank and to improve the services offered by Bank's 
international department. This aspect of the proposal lends some 
Weight toward approval of the application. It is the Board's judgment 
fchat the transaction would be in the public interest and that the 
aPPlication should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be 
cÂ°nsummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the 
effective date of this Order or (b) later than three months after 
thp 
effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended 
good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of

ATLANTIC BANCORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Atlantic Bancorporation, Jacksonville, Florida, a bank 
Elding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has 
aPPlied for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
l842(a)(3)) t o acquire not less than 70 per cent of the voting shares 
o f University Atlantic Bank, Jacksonville, Florida ("Bank"), a pro-
Posed new bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
Â§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
a n d none has been timely received. The Board has considered the appli-
Cation in light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(C)). 
Applicant controls 20 banks with aggregate deposits of about 
million, representing 4.8 per cent of the total commercial bank 
deposits in the State, and is the fifth largest banking organization and 
bar*k holding company in F l o r i d a . S i n c e Bank is a proposed new bank, 
existing competition would be eliminated nor would concentration be 
creased in any relevant area. 
in a 
Bank would be located to the east of downtown Jacksonville, 
recently developing trade area with an estimated population of

20,000, and would be competing in the Duval County banking market, in 
which market Applicant controls 31.3 per cent of deposits and is the 
largest of 13 banking organizations in that market. Applicant presently 
operates six banks in the Duval County banking market, two of which, 
Southside Atlantic Bank and The Atlantic Bank of Jacksonville, compete 
the primary service area of the proposed Bank. However, Southside 
Bank is located seven miles west of Bank and is separated from Bank by 
Numerous intervening banks. Jacksonville Bank, Applicant's lead sub-
sidiary bank, is located ten miles west of Bank and is separated from 
lt by the St. John s River, The most convenient and accessible routes 
between Jacksonville Bank and Bank are by means of toll bridges. 
Applicant's share of deposits in the relevant market has 
declined over the past ten years. The second and third largest bank 
Elding companies in the market control, respectively, 23.5 and 20.8 
P er cent of commercial bank deposits there. It appears that consumma-
tion of the proposal herein would not alter adversely the competitive 
situation nor the concentration of resources in the market. Nor is 
t^ere any evidence that Applicant's proposal is an attempt to pre-empt 
a site before there is a need for a bank. 
The financial and managerial resources and the future prospects 
of 
Applicant and its subsidiary banks are regarded as generally satis-
factory. Prospects for Bank appear favorable. Bank would be able to 
Ptovide a local alternative banking source within the proposed service 
at<5a, which is experiencing rapid growth, and is presently being served 

1584

by 
banks located outside of the service area. Considerations relating 
to the convenience and needs of the area to be served lend slight 
support to, and are consistent with, approval of the application. It 
is the Board's judgment that the proposed acquisition would be in the 
Public interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
this Order or (b) later than three months after that date, and 
University Atlantic Bank, Jacksonville, Florida, shall be opened 
business not later than six months after the effective date of this

good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
CARLTON AGENCY, INC. 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
and Acquisition of First National Bank Insurance Agency 
Carlton Agency, Inc., Carlton, Minnesota, has submitted an 
amended proposal for the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(1) of the Bank 
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) to become a bank holding 
company through the acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares 
(less directors' qualifying shares) of Carlton National Bank, Carlton, 
Minnesota ("Bank"). Applicant's original application was denied by 
Board Order dated January 27, 1972 (1972 Federal Reserve Bulletin 168). 
At the same time, Applicant has resubmitted, as part of its 
amended proposal, its application for the Board's approval under Â§ 4(c)(8) 
o f the Act and Â§ 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y to engage in 
Cettain permissible insurance agency activities through the acquisition 
o f certain assets of First National Bank Insurance Agency, Carlton, 
Minnesota ("Agency"). 
Notice of receipt of these applications was published in the 
Pe<*eral Register on April 21, 1972 (37 Federal Register 7950). Time 
filing comments and views has expired, and none havo been timely 
deceived. The Board has considered the applications in light of the 
factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act, and the considerations 
sPecifi.ed i n Â§ 4(c)(8) of the Act.

-2-
Upon acquisition of Bank ($6.3 million in deposits), Applicant 
would control about 0.1 per cent of the commercial bank deposits in 
the State.!/ As the proposed transaction represents a transfer of 
an individual's ownership of Bank into a presently nonoperating holding 
company, consummation would not eliminate any existing or potential 
competition and would not result in any increase in the concentration 
Â°f banking resources in any relevant area. Bank's management and 
financial condition are consistent with approval and its capital is 
^equate. 
Applicant's original proposal was denied by the Board on the 
bounds that the acquisition debt involved presented adverse circum-
stances bearing on the financial condition and prospects of Applicant 
a^d Bank which were not outweighed by any other factors of record. 
Under the present proposal Applicant would still incur acquisition debt 
Â°f $175,000, however, due to increased capital of the Bank from 
tetained earnings this would amount to approximately 53 per cent of 
applicant1s equity rather than 66 per cent. The balance of the debt, 
$100,000, while still being held by the principal, will no longer 
b e secured directly or indirectly by the stock of Applicant since the 
Principal has pledged assets to the lending institution with sufficient 
income to amortize the installments on the debt as they come due over 
a ten-year period. Further, due to greater than projected earnings 
fÂ°r 1971 and consequent higher projected earnings in the future, 
1/ All banking data are as of December 31, 1971. 

1567 
-3-
significantly less of Bank's earnings will be needed to amortize Appli-
cant's debt than the 60 per cent present in the first proposal. The 
Board concludes that considerations relating to the acquisition debt 
involved in the present proposal are consistent with approval of the 
application. 
The convenience and needs of the community involved are con-
sistent with approval of the application, as there will result no 
change in Bank's present operations. Accordingly, it is the Board's 
judgment that the transaction would be in the public interest, and 
that the Â§ 3 application should be approved. 
Agency is the only general insurance agency in Carlton 
(1970 population 8u4) and is located on the premises of Bank, The 
operation by a bank holding company of a general insurance agency 
in a community with a population of less than 5,000 is an activity 
that the Board has previously determined to be closely related to 
hanking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)(iii)). 
There is no evidence in the record that the proposal would 
result in any undue concentration of resources, unfair competition, 
conflicts of interest, unsound banking practices or other adverse 
effects on the public interest. The acquisition would assure continuation 
Â°f the only source of general insurance in the town of Carlton and would 
ass ist Applicant in servicing its acquisition debt. Based upon the 
foregoing and other considerations reflected in the record, the Board 

15(b8 
- 4 -
has determined that the balance of the public interest factors the 
Board is required to consider under Â§ 4(c)(8) regarding the performance 
Applicant of Agency's business is favorable and that the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications to acquire 
Â®ank and Agency are approved for the reasons summarized above. The 
acquisition of Bank shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth 
calendar day following the effective date of this Order, or (b) later 
than three months after the effective date of this Order, unless such 
Period is extended for good cause by the Board or by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Minneapolis pursuant to delegated authority. The determination 
a s to Agency's activities is subject to the Board's authority to require 
feports by, and make examinations of, holding companies and their 
Subsidiaries and to require such modification or termination of the 
activities of a holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board

Capital National Corporation, Houston, Texas, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
fÂ°r the Board's approval under Â§ 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) 
to acquire a new issue of voting shares of Northwest National Bank, 
Houston, Texas ("Bank"), which would then constitute 25 per cent of the 
shares outstanding. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
Â§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired,

shares to Applicant, Inasmuch as the proposal involves purchasing newly 
issued shares which will augment Bank's capital, the absence of an offer 
to buy all outstanding shares of Bank is not regarded as inequitable to 
Â°ther shareholders of Bank. The acquisition of voting shares of Bank 
would not significantly increase Applicant's share of total deposits 
the relevant area or within the State, and would not adversely affect 
Â°ther area banks. 
A group of Applicant's officers and principal shareholders 
sponsored the organization of Bank in 1969. Bank serves the Houston 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) as a small retail bank 
^here it ranks as the eighty-fifth largest of the market's 145 banks. 
holds .2 per cent of total deposits in this area. Applicant's sub-
sidiary, CNB, also serves the Houston SMSA as the sixth largest bank, 
hÂ°lding 2.1 per cent of total area deposits. The two banks are eight 
m U e s apart, and only .3 per cent of CNB deposits and loans originate in 
the area served by Bank, and no meaningful present competition would be 
eliminated by this proposal. It also appears that no substantial amount 
future competition would be foreclosed by the acquisition because of 
state laws which prohibit branching and in view of the 21 banking offices 
intervene the densely populated area between Bank and CNB. Com-
petitive considerations are consistent with approval of the application. 
Applicant's management is regarded as capable. The Board 
i s concerned that Applicant's level of indebtedness is relatively 
However, mitigating this consideration is the fact that 

1572 
-3-
APplicant has outstanding $2 million of subordinated convertible 
debentures that possess certain features which could result in their 
conversion to equity as early as November 1972. In addition, Appli-
cant has offered for sale a parcel of real estate, the proceeds of 
which could be used to substantially reduce Applicant's outstanding 
debt. In view of these considerations and in view of CNB's earnings 
deposit growth over the past four years, it appears that Appli-
cant's projections for retirement of its total debt in four years 
are feasible. The financial and managerial resources of Bank are 
rGgarded as satisfactory. Prospects for both Applicant and Bank 
3Ppear favorable. Considerations relating to banking factors are 
consistent with approval of the application. 
The newly issued shares of Bank's stock which Applicant 
proposed to acquire will augment Bank's capital and enable it to 
fin 
a a n c e new and permanent banking quarters, thus making it possible 
Â£ 
Bank to increase its staff and provide enlarged parking facili-

Item No. 11 
-6/16/72 
Immediate release 
J u n e 1 6 > 1 9 7 2 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System proposed 
today to put into effect on August 14 a modified technical amendment to 
3-ts margin regulations designed to improve the quality of stock market 
Cl'edit. The change will strengthen the equity position of low-margin 
founts when offsetting sales and purchases of stock collateral are 
on the same day. 
The proposed amendment :1s basically the came as that published 
by thG L o a r d f o r public comment on April 28. However, because of cer-
taiu technical changes made since that time, the Board said it will 
l*eceive additional comment on the modified proposal through July 10. 
modifications affect: the manner of calculating the status of margin 
founts. 
Under the modified amendment, use of the "same-day substi-
^tion" rule would end in accounts where the debt--adjusted as defined 
Uie regulationâis more than 60 per cent of the market value of the 
8tock. collateral in the account. 
Under the "same-day substitution" rule, customers arc permitted 
to Substitute one security for another in their accounts through off-
*ettin8 purchases and sales made on the same day even if the amount is 

- 2 -
the initial margin requirement. Presently, no margin customer is 
to put up additional equity unless he buys more "securities 
tllat* ho. sells on that: day. This practice makes it possible for customers 
V'lth undermargined accounts to continue trading for extended periods 
wit-hout putting up additional equity. 
Today's action would amend the Board's regulations governing 
tensions of credit by brokers and dealers (Regulation T) and loans by 
b^Â»ks and other lenders (Regulation U and G respectively) for the pur-
of purchasing or carrying stocks registered on a national exchange 
named, in the Board's over-the-counter margin list. 
In a second action, the Board also said it intends to adopt, 
'^fective August 14, another technical amendment to Regulation T to 
short sales of stock into which bonds are convertible on the 
terms as ordinary short sales of stock. 
A copy of the amendments is attached.
