Competitive factor reports. There had been distributed a draft 
°f report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the competi-
tive factors involved in the proposed acquisition of assets and assump-
tion of liabilities of Manchester Savings Bank, Manchester, New 
Hampshire, by Manchester Trust Company, also of Manchester.

Governor Brimmer noted that the draft conclusion stated that 
the transaction would have no adverse competitive effects. It seemed 
to him the analysis of the case would support a conclusion going 
beyond that point and stating that the transaction would have a favor-
able effect on competition. 
There being agreement with that view, the report was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Corporation in a form in which the 
conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed acquisition of assets 
and assumption of liabilities of the Manchester Savings 
Bank by the Manchester Trust Company, which now has no 
deposits and is engaged solely in fiduciary activities, 
would represent the conversion of a mutual savings bank 
to a commercial bank. The transaction would have favor-
able competitive effects. 
A report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of United Bank and Trust 
Company, New York, New York, into Royal National Bank of New York, 
also of New York City, was approved unanimously for transmittal to 
the Comptroller. The conclusion stated that consummation of the 
Proposed merger would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Approved items. The following items were approved unanimously 
after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the Board. Copies are attached under the numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Telegrams to the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
1-2 
York approving the opening of accounts (1) in 
the name of Central Bank of Ireland, and (2)

salaries to officers of the Bank effective

Application of First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company 
_(Items 4-6). On the basis of staff material that had been distributed 
and a favorable recommendation by the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation, the Board approved unanimously the application of The 
First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania, to merge with Chestnut Street Trust Company (in process of 
organization), also of Philadelphia. 
The distributed material included drafts of an order and a 
statement reflecting the favorable recommendation and a memorandum in 
which the Division recommended approval of the application of Chestnut 
Street Trust Company for membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
The merger and membership applications were merely devices to 
facilitate the formation of a one-bank holding company (First Pennsyl-
vania Corporation), as described in the order and statement. 
The issuance of the order and statement was authorized. Copies 
°f the documents, in the form in which they were issued, are attached 
a s Items 4 and 5. The application for membership was approved unani-
m°usly; a copy of the letter sent to Chestnut Street Trust Company 
attached as Item No. 6.

Item No. 4 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

In the Matter of the Application of 
THE FIRST PENNSYLVANIA BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY 
approval of merger with 
Chestnut Street Trust Company 
ORDER APPROVING MERGER OF BANKS

Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
a State member bank of the Federal Reserve System, for the Board's 
Prior approval of the merger of that bank with Chestnut Street 
Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the charter of the 
Matter bank and the name of the former. Notice of the proposed 
merger, in form approved by the Board, has been published pursuant

involved in the proposed merger,

Item No. 5 
BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
12/24/68 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY THE FIRST PENNSYLVANIA BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH 
CHESTNUT STREET TRUST COMPANY 
STATEMENT 
The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ("Applicant"), with total deposits of 
$1.8 billion has applied, pursuant to the Bank Merger Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Board's prior approval of the merger 
°f that bank with Chestnut Street Trust Company, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania ("Chestnut Street Bank"), which is a newly organized 
bank, not yet in operation. The banks would merge under the name 
Applicant and the charter of Chestnut Street Bank, which is to 
be a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
The proposed merger is one step in a plan of corporate 
reorganization whereby First Pennsylvania Corporation, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, a newly organized Pennsylvania corporation, would 
become a one-bank holding company. First Pennsylvania Corporation 
Presently owns all of the stock of Chestnut Street Bank; upon the 
merger of Applicant with Chestnut Street Bank, stock of First 
Pennsylvania Corporation will be exchanged for stock of Applicant. 

The major purpose for the use of a merger transaction in 
Applicant's plan to form a one-bank holding company is to assure 
that The First Pennsylvania Corporation v;ill be able to acquire, 
except for directors' qualifying shares, all of the outstanding 
stock of the banking subsidiary. 
Statutory considerations, - From the record before the 
Board, the proposed merger of Applicant and Chestnut Street Bank--
the latter being a bank v;ith no operating history, formed solely to 
facilita te the corporate reorganization plan described above--would 
itself have no effect on either competition or the banking 
convenience and needs of any relevant area. Nor uould it appear 
that the proposal uould have any adverse consequences relative to 
the financial and managerial resources and prospects of Applicant 
Chestnut Street Bank. 
Accordingly, and in light of all of the standards set 
forth in the Bank Herger Act, the Board concludes that the appli-
cation should be approved.
