Social Security legislation (Item No. 1). Vice Chairman 
Robertson stated that he had received a telephone call from Senator 
John Williams this morning asking for information regarding the effects 
of proposed Social Security legislation and its relation to the Federal 
Reserve's position in connection with fiscal action. Governor Robertson 
stated that he would have in mind furnishing Senator Williams a copy of 
Chairman Martin's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee 
°n September 14, 1967, regarding the need for a tax increase, with the 
statement that this represented the views of the Board at the present 
time. in addition, he would contemplate furnishing whatever factual 
•^formation could be developed promptly as to the impact of the pro-
Posed Social Security bill now under discussion in the Senate on tax 
r e
venues during the first half of 1968. It might also be helpful to 
Ornish some information on the extent to which the proposed Social 
Security bill, if enacted, would affect consumer expenditures in the

Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller of 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger 
of Grant County Bank, John Day, Oregon, into First National Bank of 
Oregon, Portland, Oregon, was approved unanimously for transmittal to 
the Comptroller. The conclusion read as follows: 
There appears to be little competition existing 
between Grant County Bank, John Day, Oregon, and First 
National Bank of Oregon, Portland, a subsidiary of 
Western Bancorporation, Los Angeles, California, a 
registered bank holding company. 
The two large Oregon banks now dominate banking 
in the State through control of nearly 80 per cent of 
the total banking deposits in the State and operation 
of approximately two-thirds of all banking offices. 
Consummation of the proposed merger would increase 
an already unduly heavy concentration of banking re-
sources in the two largest banks. Overall, the effect 
of the proposal on competition would be substantially 
adverse. 
Application of Franklin County Trust Company (Items 5 and 6). 
There had been distributed drafts of an order and statement reflecting 
the Board's approval on October 25, 1967, of the application of Franklin 
County Trust Company, Greenfield, Massachusetts, to merge with The Orange 
National Bank, Orange, Massachusetts.

New York Corporation, New York, New York, to acquire the voting shares 
of Endicott Trust Company, Endicott, New York, and Dutchess Bank & Trust 
Company, Poughkeepsie, New York. A dissenting statement by Governor 
Robertson had also been distributed. 
The issuance of the orders and statement was authorized. Copies 
°f the documents, as issued, are attached as Items 7-9. A copy of Gov-
ernor Robertson's dissenting statement is attached as Item No. 10.

°f the approval by the Board on November 3, 1967, of the application of 
Central Wisconsin Bankshares, Inc., Wausau, Wisconsin, to become a bank 
holding company through acquisition of the voting shares of Mosinee

ment, did not desire to change his vote in favor of approval of the 
a
Pplication, and would have no objection to the issuance of an order

C H A I R M A N 
November 15, 1967. 
The Honorable John J. Williams 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 20510 
Dear Senator Williams: 
You have inquired concerning our views as to the 
need for fiscal restraint in the current economic situa-
tion. Let me note, first, that I firmly believe we need 
greater fiscal restraint soon to moderate inflationary 
pressures and to keep economic growth proceeding at a sus-
tainable pace. Additional fiscal restraint will be particu-
larly important in the first half of 1968, when the advancing 
pace of economic activity that began earlier this year is 
likely to accelerate and to spread through the economy. 
In a speech today before the American Petroleum In-
stitute in Chicago - a copy of which I am enclosing - Chair-
man Martin states: "We need restraint on both sides of the 
Federal ledger, and we need it as quickly as it is possible 
to get it." I strongly share that view, as does every mem-
ber of the Board of Governors. 
You also asked for the estimates of our staff re-
lating to certain aspects of the Senate Bill on Social Se-
curity. Our staff estimates that the bill's provisions would 
increase benefit payments by $4.7 billion, at annual rates, 
effective April 1, 1968.. The bill also would increase the 
tax base by an amount that would raise tax payments by $2.2 
billion at annual rates during 1968, with half of the in-
creased taxes paid by employees and half by employers. The 
increase in tax liabilities is smaller than the rise in 
scheduled benefit payments, and its economic effects would 
occur later in the year. The full $4.7 billion (annual 
rate) in benefits would be added to consumers' income dur-
ing the second quarter of 1968; additions to incomes at 

L, 
The Honorable John J. Williams:--#2 
? 
annual rates of about $3 billion and $2-1/2 billion would occur 
during the third and fourth quarters since in those quarters the 
increase in the tax base would raise tax payments. According 
to our staff estimates, from this additional income consumer 
spending would be augmented by about $3 billion, at an annual 
rate, during the second quarter of 1968, and by about $3-1/2 
billion (annual rate) in the last half of the year. 
While we are of the view that there is a need for greater 
fiscal restraint, it is not within the province of the Federal 
Reserve to attempt to determine or specify the nature of that 
restraint or the areas in which it will be applied. It is, of 
course, within the power of Congress to increase expenditures 
in one area and to offset - or more than offset - such increases 
through tax action or expenditure cuts in other areas. These are 
matters for determination by the Congress. The Federal Reserve's 
concern is with the overall fiscal posture of the government, 
rather than with specific programs. 
I trust these comments will be helpful to you. 
Sincerely, 
.»t*

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Associa-
tion) , New York, New York, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 
j
 o f
 the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in the city of 
Djakarta, Republic of Indonesia, and to operate and maintain such 
branch subject to the provisions of such Section and of Regulation M. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before December 1, 1968, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority granted 
hereby will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please inform the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank "of New York, when the branch is opened for business, 
furnishing information as to the exact location of the branch. Tba 
Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the brar.ch in Djakarta. 
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
'oreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the form 
°f allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as 
foreign assets for purposes of the voluntary foreign credit restraint 
effort.

DATE: November 9, 1967 
SUBJECT: Conference of System Trust 
Examiners 
A 
During the first full week of February the Trust Division of the 
"terican Bankers Association holds the Mid-Winter Trust Conference in New York 
Interested trust examining personnel, from all or at least nearly all 
®serve Banks, customarily attend this conference. For this reason, it has 
Q c n
 the practice to have a meeting of System personnel at the Federal Reserve 
®nk of New York on either Thursday or Thursday and Friday following the 
^"Winter Trust Conference. A meeting at this time has the twofold advantage 
c
 Minimizing expenses and loss of timefrom work. 
held 
Since 1959 a formal conference of System Trust Examiners has been 
j. each three years; in the other two years the conference has been informal. 
the triennial formal meeting is to be held, one would be held in 1968. If 
formal meeting is not held, Vice President Piderit advises that the Federal 
8
erve Bank of New York proposes to invite System personnel to attend an informal 
e e
U n g o n Thursday following the close of the Mid-Winter Trust Conference. 
t Q 
Since the time and money spent are about the same, it seeme desirable 
c
^ange the existing procedure and have a formal meeting each year. Greater 
flow from a formal meeting for agenda items customarily are solicited 
a n
 agenda prepared and sent out in advance. 
If the Board approves, a formal meeting of System Trust Examiners will 
Co f
 l d o n
 Thursday or Thursday and Friday following the 1968 Mid-Winter Trust 
t^
n f e
rence. The length of the meeting will depend on the topics submitted for 
a
8enda. The staff proposes to contact the Reserve Banks with respect to 
the
e t U
*
a n c e
 
appropriate personnel and development of a suitable agenda. Unless 
t e
 are objections it is probable a formal conference will be held each year. 
There is attached a draft letter to the Presidents of all Federal

 Banks informing them of the proposed conference.

OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY FRANKLIN COUNTY TRUST COMPANY 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH 
THE ORANGE NATIONAL BANK 
STATEMENT 
Franklin County Trust Company, Greenfield, Massachusetts 
' ^anklin"), with total deposits of about $18 million, has applied, 
Pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Board's 
p
*ior approval of the merger of that bank with The Orange National 
« jy ' 5'
v 
®ank, Orange, Massachusetts ("Orange Bank"), which has total deposits 
of 
1/ 
a
bout $4 million."" 
The banks would merge under the charter and 
n a n i e
 
Franklin, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As 
atl
 incident to the merger, the sole office of Orange Bank would become 
* Stanch of Franklin, increasing the number of its offices to three. 
Competition. - Franklin operates its head office and sole 
br 
®Bch i n Greenfield (population about 18,000); the sole office of

 6,000). In terms of deposits, Franklin and Orange Bank rank first 
third, respectively, among the five commercial banks headquartered 
P r
ankli n County (population about 55,000). 
^ ^ S u r e s are as of June 30, 1967. 
•"it vty? M*. *, 

There is no meaningful competition between Franklin and 
Orange Bank. Massachusetts lav; permits intra-county branching, but 
development of competition between the two banks through de novo 
Ranching seems improbable in view of the small size of Orange Bank and 
the community it serves. 
The principal competition for Orange Bank is furniahed by 
^ree offices of two commercial banks located within a four-mile radius 
o f
 Orange in Athol (population about 12,000), situated in adjacent 
Worcester County. It does not appear that either of these banks would 
b e a d v
ersely affected by the proposed transaction. 
The merger would have no significant adverse effects on 
Coin
Petition. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The 
Qn
fcing factors with respect to each of the banks proposing to merge 
satisfactory, as they would be with respect to the resulting bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities. - The merger would 
f e c t
 banking convenience and needs only in the area presently served 
by Q r Q
nge Bank. The larger credit needs of the area are not being met 
V

r
ange Bank, due, in part, to its lending limit of $30,000. The 
Q r
sio n of Orange Bank into an office of Franklin would provide for 
Orange community more convenient access to broader credit accommoda-
ttons n j to a generally wider range of banking services.

Summary and conclusion. - In the judgment of the Board, the 
Proposed merger uould benefit the banking convenience and needs of the 
community presently served by Orange Bank, and v/ould not have any signifi-
c
antly adverse consequences for banking competition. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the application should 
b e
 approved.

STATEMENT 
Charter New York Corporation, New York, New York ("Applicant"), 
re
8istered bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, 
Pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of all of 
t h
e voting shares of Dutchess Bank & Trust Company, Poughkeepsie, New 
Y
°rk ("Dutchess Bank"), and Endicott Trust Company, Endicott, New York 
("Endicott Trust"). 
Although the applications have been acted upon separately, 
he Board has determined that unnecessary repetition of facts and con-

Competitive effect of proposed transactions. - Applicant began 
operations as a bank holding company on July 1, 1966 with two subsidiary 
banks, Irving Trust Company> New York City ("Irving"), and The Merchants 
National Bank & Trust Company, Syracuse ("Merchants"). It is the third 
largest bank holding company and the eighth largest banking organization 
in New York State, in terms of total deposits held by its subsidiaries, 
^ e present applications are the first to be filed by Applicant since its 
formation. 
Irving, the seventh largest commercial bank in New York City, 
i s
 primarily a wholesale bank. Its $3.1 billion of deposits-^are heavily 
c
°ncentrated in large size accounts of business corporations, domestic 
b a
nks, and foreign central banks. Although Irving operates nationally 
a n d
 internationally, only about 2 per cent of its deposits of individuals, 
Pa
rtnerships, and corporations ("IPC deposits") originate in areas of 
New York State, outside New York City and the nearby counties of WestChester, 
S u f
£olk, and Nassau. 
Applicant's other present subsidiary, Merchants, has total 
P°sits of $149 million. It is the fourth largest of five banks head-
tered in Syracuse, New York, and ranks fifth in deposit size among 
2 6
 commercial banks located in New York State's Sixth Banking District. 
Endicott Trust operates four offices in the Seventh Banking

headquartered in Broome County, and the fifth largest of 34 banks in 
the Seventh Banking District, 
Dutchess Bank is headquartered in Poughkeepsie in the Third 
Banking District, and operates four banking offices with total deposits 
$28 million. It is the second largest of three commercial banks 
h 
y 
aeadquartered in Poughkeepsie, the largest (with deposits of $118 million) 
heing a subsidiary of Marine Midland Corporation, a registered bank 
holding company, and the smallest (with deposits of $15 million) being 
a
 subsidiary of Bankers Trust New York Corporation, also a registered 
bat
*k holding company. Dutchess Bank is the third largest of 13 banks 
1,11
 Dutchess County and ranks seventeenth in deposit size amoung 52 banks 
i n
 the Third Banking District. 
Acquisition by Applicant of the $79 million in deposits involved 
the two applications would increase its share of the total deposits 
by New York State commercial banks by only .1 per cent. It would 
COtiM n 
A
nue to hold just under 5 per cent of such deposits and its relative 
^ag among the State's largest holding companies and banking organi-
°ns would remain unchanged. In upstate New York (that is, excluding

areas. Also, since each of the present and proposed subsidiaries is 
located in a different Banking District and serves a distinct area, 
there would be no increase in concentration in any of the Banking Districts 
0 r
 primary service areas involved. 
Since Endicott Trust and Dutchess Bank are located 150 miles

Part in different Banking Districts, no existing or potential compe-
tition between them would be eliminated by their affiliation with Applicant. 
Either does it appear that consummation of the proposed acquisitions would

Ca
ftt's present subsidiaries. Endicott Trust is located about 200 miles

 regard to deposits or loans held by one bank but origi-

 long-standing relationships, the fact that Irving offers 
ogs not available at Dutchess Bank, or represent local deposits of

bar

by Endicott Trust and each of which is a holding company subsidiary. 
Applicant has indicated its intention to pursue, through Endicott Trust, 
a vigorous branching policy which should increase the competitive 
G
ffectiveness of the bank both within the Endicott area and within a 
larger "Triple-Cities" area which includes Binghamton and Johnson City. 
does not appear that the viability or competitive effectiveness of 
Waller banks, which are already subject to the competition of larger 
banks and holding company subsidiaries, would be adversely affected. 
Acquisition of Dutchess Bank, the last independent bank head-
bartered in Poughkeepsie, would have the effect of removing "home 
of
fice protection" from the City of Poughkeepsie, thereby permitting 
e
 introduction of new competition through de novo branching. At 
lea 
s
t one bank has already applied for supervisory permission to establish 
a
 branch in Poughkeepsie, contingent upon consummation of Applicant's 
Proposal. Dutchess Bank has itself operated conservatively with respect 
to Possible branch expansion and, to the extent that affiliation with 
Ad 
P icant encourages more extensive branching, its acquisition could 
resi, i f.

 in the introduction of a new competitive force in other areas

for 
In view of New York branching restrictions, the only possibility 
the development of competition between any of Applicant's present and 
Pto P O R , 
s
od subsidiaries through branching results from the fact that Irving 
d
 Dutchess Bank can both legally establish branches in Westchester 
-ount y* However, in view of Irving's strong inclination toward whole-
sale b anking, and in view of Dutchess Bank's size, location, and apparent

"7" 
lack of interest in extensive branching, the prospects that either one 
would do so are regarded as very improbable. 
It does not appear that the proposed acquisitions, if consum-
mated, would result in a monopoly or be in furtherance of any combination, 
conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
re
levant area. Neither does it appear probable that consummation of 
e
ither or both of Applicants proposals would substantially lessen 
competition or restrain trade in any area. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The financial 
condition, management, and prospects of Applicant and its present subsid-
iaries are regarded as reasonably satisfactory. 
Endicott Trust's financial condition and management are regarded 
satisfactory. Its prospects would probably be enhanced as a subsidiary 
1
 Applicant, but would be considered favorable even if it were to remain 
a q a
a independent institution. 
Dutchess Bank has experienced good growth and earnings and is 
°
a
sidered adequately capitalized. The bank apparently suffers to some 
e t l t
 f r o m a iacfc 0 f strength in middle management, with the result that 
t0Q much of the present workload rests on its President. In view of these 
VPa 1 
bosses and in view of the bank's limited branch system relative to 
°ther k , 
oanks in the area, the prospects of Dutchess Bank are regarded as 
l y
 
as an independent institution. The expansion of its branch 
System

Considerations bearing on the banking factors are consistent 
with approval of both applications, and lend some weight toward approval 
°f the proposed acquisition of Dutchess Bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - There is 
n
° evidence of any major banking needs presently going unserved in the 
a
reas served by Endicott Trust or Dutchess Bank. It is asserted bv 
Applicant, however, that the expertise of Irving and Merchants in special-
ized areas of lending would assist both of the proposed subsidiary banks

f
equirements of their areas for business loans, construction loans. 
res
idential mortgage loans, and consumer loans. Greater local availability 
onstruction financing is alleged to be of particular significance in 
h o
 Endicott area. Applicant also contemplates assisting both banks in 
Sloping broader branch systems to serve the needs of their communities. 
• 
The assistance which Applicant could render to Endicott Trust 
Dutchess Bank in expanding both the range of services offered and the 
8e
°Sraphic area served by them is a consideration which adds weight in 
£ 
0 r
 of approval of both applications. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
ained i n the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in

a c
tions would be in the public interest and that the applications

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
In a case such as this where two viable, independent banks, 
each an effective service component in its banking district, are pro-
Posed to be acquired by a bank holding company whose system already 
controls $3.2 billion of deposits, approval of such proposal should be 
given only if it is shown that the public interest will be better 
served thereby - i.e., by the transformation of these independent local 
sources of banking services into units of a New York City based holding 
company. 
*1 ^ 
My dissent from the Board's approval of Charter New York 
I M S - . 
r
Poration's proposal is premised upon the absence of any evidence 
f\ £ Public benefit likely to result from these acquisitions. Endicott 
Tr 
U s
t Company, a $51 million institution, will not, as an affiliate of 
barter New York Corporation, significantly improve or expand its services 
t o
 customers in the Seventh Banking District. Endicott Trust is the 
of two banks located in Endicott, New York, the second largest 
Of f-f 
i5
-ve banks in Broome County, and the fifth largest of 34 banks in 
t l l e
 Seventh Banking District. Its continued ability to render profitably 
full scale banking services as an independent institution stands un-
c
haii 
1 i e
nged in the record. The Dutchess Bank, x/ith $28 million of deposits, 
is 8
°toewhat a lesser competitive force within its service area. It is 
the 
third largest of 13 banks in Dutchess County and seventeenth in size 
of t, 
a e
 52 banks in the Third Banking District. Despite its size, it 
S G
ntly competes xjith two subsidiaries of two bank holding companies,

c 
°ne of which subsidiaries is over four times the size of Dutchess Bank, 
While Dutchess Bank's prospects might be bettered through its acquisition

y Applicant, 
there is nothing in the record before the Board to indicate 
^at the bank is not performing a valuable and profitable service as an 
independent institution. In my judgment, the sum of the benefits likely 
i 
t o
 flow from this proposal is insufficient to outweigh the adverse compet-
i^ive impact to result from expansion of Applicant's holding company system 
^ acquisition of two independent sources of banking service.

Dear Mr. Murphy: 
This is in reference to your letter of November 8, 1967, 
in which you advised that construction of quarters to house a branch 
on Halsey Street, Brewton, will not be completed until January 10, 
1968. The establishment of this branch was approved by the Board of 
Governors on December 6, 1966, provided the branch would be estab-
lished by June 6, 1967. You requested an extension of time within 
which the branch may hi opened and, on May 25, 1967, the Board of 
Governors extended the time until December 6, 1967. Due to a delay 
in completion of construction of the quarters, you now request another 
extension. 
On behalf of the Board of Governors, acting under dele-
gated authority, this Bank has approved the extension of time within 
which the Citizens-Farmers & Merchants Bank may establish a branch 
at 105-107 Halsey Street, Brewton, to February 1, 1968. 
Very truly yours, 
Harold T. Patterson 
President

Dear Mr. Lunding: 
Acting under delegated authority, the Director of the

Donald E. Mahs as Federal Reserve Agent's Representative at the 
Detroit Branch, replacing Robert W . Cook, who has been redesignated 
as an Alternate Federal Reserve Agent's Representative. 
This approval is given with the understanding that 
Mr. Mahs will be solely responsible to the Federal Reserve Agent 
and the Board of Governors for the proper performance of his duties, 
except that, during rhe absence or disability of the Federal Reserve 
Agent or a vacancy in that office, his responsibility will be to the 
Assistant Federal Reserve Agent and the Board of Governors. 
When not engaged in the performance of his duties as 
Federal Reserve Agent's Representative, Mr. Mahs may, with the ap-
proval of the Federal Reserve Agent and the Vice President in charge 
of the Detroit Branch, perform such work for the Branch as will not 
be inconsistent with his duties as Federal Reserve Agent's 
Representative. 
It will be appreciated if Mr. Mahs is fully informed of 
the importance of his responsibilities as a member of the staff of 
the Federal Reserve Agent and the need for maintenance of indepen-
dence from the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these 
responsibilities. 
It is noted from your letter that with the approval of 
this appointment by the Board of Governors, Mr. Mahs will execute 
the usual Oath of Office which will be forwarded to the Board of 
Governors .
