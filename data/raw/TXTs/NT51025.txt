2/16/73 
FIRST FLORIDA BANCORPORATION 
Order Approving Merger of Bank Holding Companies 
First Florida Bancorporation, Tampa, Florida ("First Florida"), 
a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company 
Act, has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(5) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(5)) to merge with United Bancshares of Florida, Inc., 
Miami Beach, Florida ("United"), under the certificate of incorporation 
°f First Florida and the title of United First Florida Banks, Inc. 
Notice of receipt of the application, affording an opportunity 
for interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and 
views has expired some eight months ago. The nature and scope of the 
subject proposal, hereafter discussed, including its likely direct and 
indirect effect on banking competition in Florida, has necessitated an 
unusual amount of staff analysis and Board study with the noted lengthy 
processing period. In this process, the Board has considered the entire 
r
ecord, including the application and all comments received in light of 
the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
First Florida controls 28 banks with aggregate deposits of 
$587.2 million representing 3.4 per cent of deposits of commercial banks 
in Florida, and is the sixth 
largest banking organization in the State.1/ 
United controls six banks with total deposits of $384.3 million repre-
senting 2.3 per cent of aggregate deposits in the State, and is Florida's

twelfth largest banking organization. Consummation of the proposed merger 
would result in First Florida's control of 5.7 per cent of total State 
d e
Posits, and the resulting organization would become the State's fifth 
largest banking organization. Of course these percentages have no signi-
ficance other than indicating the relative size of the named organizations. 
State of Florida is not a banking market in any meaningful sense; it 
l s
 a political entity which encompasses a large number of banking markets 
s
°me of which are interrelated. 
All of First Florida's present subsidiary banks are located in 
the northern two-thirds of Florida, and it is represented in several of 
major banking markets in that portion of the State. It is dominant 
in 
n
 none. Its shares of total deposits and the market size of the most 
significant related areas are as follows: Jacksonville $1,467 million 
(
6
 per cent); Lakeland $521 million (9 per cent); Melbourne $310 million 
per cent); Orlando $1,102 million (7 per cent); and Tampa $2,772 million 
^ per cent). United, on the other hand, is concentrated in southern 
Florida. Five of its subsidiaries are located in the Dade County banking 
Market, where it is the third largest banking organization holding approx-
imately 9 per cent of deposits, and its remaining subsidiary is located 
the nearby West Palm Beach area. Since the closest subsidiary banks 
the proponents are over 50 miles apart and the remaining subsidiaries 
a r
e more than 100 miles apart, and considering the nature of the bank, 
c
°nsummation of the proposal could not eliminate any significant amount of 
^ p e t i t i o n . 

-11-
514 
The United States Department of Justice, in commenting on 
this proposal, agreed that it would eliminate no significant existing 
competition. With respect to the effect of the proposal on potential 
competition, the Department felt that consummation of the proposal 
would eliminate the possibility that First Florida would enter the 
Dade County market through the establishment of a de novo bank or 
"foothold" bank already in the market and the possibility of United 
e
ntering the Tampa banking market through the same means. It 
therefore felt that consummation of the proposal would have an 
adverse effect on potential competition with respect to Dade County 
a
nd Tampa. Furthermore, the Department felt that Che proposed merger 
"could trigger a wave of consolidations among other large Florida bank 
holding companies and would, have a significantly adverse effect on the 
competitive structure of banking throughout the State." 
The Board recognizes that consummation of the proposal would 
foreclose the possibility that United would expand to become a State-
wide competitor of First Florida. However, the Board believes that 
a substantial adverse effect on potential competition occurs only 
where there is a probability rather than a possibility that substantial 
competition would develop between the banking organizations involved 
in the absence of the proposal. Taking into account the time lag 
involved in attempting to establish competitive effectiveness through 
a "foothold" or de novo entry, we do not believe that the record in 
this case reflects a probability that, absent this proposal, United 

515 
-11-
would expand to become a Statewide competitor of First Florida in 
the reasonably foreseeable future. Furthermore, with respect to any 
particular market, such as the Tampa market, the Board does not 
believe that the record establishes that such entry is more than a 
possibility. 
With respect to Dade County the Board believes that, absent 
this proposal, it is probable that First Florida would enter de novo 
through the acquisition of one of the smaller banks or banking 
groups in that market. However, due to the structure of banking in 
Dade County we do not believe that the foreclosure of First Florida's 
entry as an independent competitor would have any substantial adverse 
effects on competition in that market. Banking in Dade County has 
been becoming more and more competitive. While the largest banking 
°rganization in the market holds approximately 24 per cent of market 
deposits, the next five banking organizations hold market shares 
tanging from approximately 10 per cent to approximately 5 per cent. 
In addition to these six organizations, the second and fourth largest 
banking organizations in the State established a competitive presence 
in the market during 1972. Further, Edge Act subsidiaries of some of 
the nation's largest banks compete aggressively in Miami for inter-
national banking business. 
While consummation of the present proposal would eliminate 
first Florida as another potential entrant, the retail banking 
customers in Dade County are presently served by 46 banking organizations. 

516 
-11-
Foreclosure of the possibility of a forty-seventh could hardly have 
adverse effects on competition for retail business. As to the customer 
in need of wholesale and regional banking services, the proposal, 
rather than being anticompetitive, should in fact be procompetitive 
by creating a fifth institution in the Miami market with established 
relationships in Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, Melbourne and other 
Florida communities and having in the aggregate resources of approximately 
$1 bill ion. 
With respect to the question whether the proposal will have 
a significantly adverse effect on competition due to the fact that it 
"could trigger" similar consolidations among large Florida holding 
companies, the Board believes that each application before it should 
be decided on the merits of that particular application. As we have 
previously stated, each subsequent application must also receive the 
approval of the Board and will be analyzed on the basis of the competitive 
structure of the market and other facts existing at the time of Board 
consideration (57 Federal Reserve Bulletin 348). 
The financial conditions and managerial resources of First 
Florida, United, and their respective groups of banks are generally 
satisfactory and their prospects appear favorable. These considerations 
are consistent with approval of the applications. The primary banking 
needs of the areas served by both holding companies appear to be 
adequately met at the present time. However, consummation of the 
Proposal would create another regional organization with resources 

more appropriate to meeting inter-regional needs. At the .same time, the 
Board does not believe that there would be any noticeable adverse 
effects on the competitive structure of Florida banking if there were 
26 rather than 27 organizations with deposits of over $100 million. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served lend some weight toward approval. It is the Board's 
judgment that the proposed transaction is in the public interest and 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
this Order, or (b) later than three months after the effective date 
°f this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the 
Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant to delegated 
authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors,i! effective February 16, 1973.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
"518 
I would deny this application. To approve the merger of these 
two bank holding companies would not be in the public interest. 
More-
over, it would end a clearly-defined policy followed consistently by 
the Federal Reserve over the last several years which has sought the 
development of a well-balanced and competitive banking system in Florida. 
The quantitative dimensions of this proposal are far from 
trivial. First Florida Bancorporation ("First Florida") is the 
sixth largest banking organization in the State. With 28 banks and 
total deposits of $587.2 million, it controls 3.4 per cent of commercial 
bank deposits. United Bancshares of Florida ("United") ranks twelfth 
in size among banking organizations. It has six banks whose deposits 
total $384.3 million—giving United 2.3 per cent of aggregate deposits 
in the State. The combined organization would rank fifth among 
banking institutions in Florida; it would control 34 banks, $971.5 mil-
lion of deposits, and 5.7 per cent of aggregate deposits in the State 
as a whole. Consequently, the Board is not being asked to allow two 
small and struggling organizations to combine in order to survive in 
the face of vigorous competition mounted by industry giants. 
Instead, two holding companies (one already possessing an 
extensive network of banks and the other fully capable of inde-
pendent development) 
are seeking the Board
f
s approval for an action 
that would have a substantially adverse effect on potential competition 
in the Dade County area—and which would produce no significant public 
benefits.

Evolution of Bank Holding Companies in Florida 
The majority's approval of this merger is particularly 
distressing when the action is viewed against the pattern of Board 
decisions in holding company cases in Florida over the last several 
years. Bank holding companies in Florida began to expand in the mid-
1960's, but the pace of growth quickened noticeably in 1969. At the 
end of 1968, there were 10 bank holding companies in the State—controlling 
86 banks with $3.8 billion of deposits. Thus, bank holding companies 
had control of just under one-fifth of all the commercial banks and 
about one-third of all the deposits in the State. During the next 
f
our years, the number of holding companies rose to 29* the number of 
banks controlled by them climbed to 30 7, and the volume of deposits 
expanded to $10.6 billion.!/ 
So just about half of the banks and over 
two-thirds 
of the commercial bank deposits in Florida are under the 
direction of bank holding companies. 
Nevertheless, the banking structure in Florida—until n o w — 
h
as evolved in a balanced and competitive framework. At year-end, 
l 9
? 2 , the 29 multi-bank holding companies in Florida had $11.2 billion 
°f deposits, representing 66.6per cent of the State's total. 
Yet, 
a
s shown in Table 1 (attached) the degree of concentration in banking 
^sources remained quite low. For example, the four largest multi-bank 
and ulT^

holding companies were fairly close together in terms of size. Each 
had total deposits in the neighborhood of $1.0 billion, and in combi-
nation they held 26.9 per cent of aggregate deposits in the State. 
The next four largest holding companies (with deposits ranging from 
$459 million to $771 million) collectively held 14.0 per cent of 
total Florida deposits. Thus, the eight top-ranking banking groups 
controlled slightly more than two-fifths of the aggregate commercial 
bank deposits in the State. 
pattern of Previous Board Decisions in Florida 
This relatively modest degree of concentration in banking 
resources in Florida is by no means accidental. Rather it has resulted 
from the interaction of several factors which have reinforced each 
other: 
(1) as stressed above, the period of intense holding company 
consolidation in the State is of recent origin; (2) Florida contains 
a relatively large number of banks with deposits in excess of 
$100 million—and thus capable of leading sizable holding companies; 
and (3) Federal Reserve Board decisions in holding company and merger 
cases have generally prohibited large organizations from significant 
acquisitions in local markets or from entering new markets through 
acquisitions of the largest banks in those markets. 
Among these three factors, the role of the Federal Reserve 
Board has been of major significance. In making its decisions, the 
Board has encouraged the entry of holding companies into new banking 
markets through the establishment of new banks or through foothold 
acquisitions. Just how this policy has been carried out 

_ 5Z1 
-9-
in practice can be seen in the evidence summarized in Table 2. 
The 
figures show the deposit size of acquired banking organizations in 
Florida bank holding company cases during the period 1969-72. 
During 
these four years, the Board approved 136 acquisitions and denied 
13.2/ 
N o n e 
o f 
t h e 
b a n k s acquired had deposits in excess of $250 million; 
only two had deposits in the range of $100-250 million, and eight were 
in the $50-100 million deposit class. 
In fact, nearly 93 per cent of 
the banks acquired had deposits of $50 million or less, and 7 per cent 
exceeded that figure. 
In other words, the Board's emphasis on foothold 
acquisitions is clearly evident. 
Moreover, reflecting the Board's 
strong encouragement of de novo entry into particular markets, almost 
one-quarter of the acquisitions represented newly-launched banks. 
The 13 holding company applications denied by the Board 
reflected the same objective of fostering a balanced and competitive 
banking structure in Florida. 
In fact, one of the denials involved 
a number of elements paralleling those in the present application. 
In 1971, Southeast Banking Corporation (the largest banking organiza-
tion in the State with headquarters in Miami) sought to acquire 
Combanks Corporation which controlled five banks in the Orlando 
banking m a r k e t - w i t h $85 million in deposits. 
In denying the applica-
tion, the Board stressed that both existing and significant potential 
competition would have been e l i m i n a t e d - s i n c e Southeast was most likely

to. enhance its existing position in the rapidly growing Orlando 
market by establishing another new bank or through the acquisition of 
a bank with a smaller volume of deposits (58 Federal Reserve Bulletin 
54^56). 
In pursuit of its goal of encouraging a balanced and •. 
competitive banking structure in Florida, Federal Reserve Board members 
have been remarkably of one mind in deciding holding company cases. 
This conclusion stands out sharply in the statistics shown in Table 3, 
tthich summarize Board votes on Florida bank holding company cases during 
the period 1969-72. During these four years, 135 of the 149 cases 
(90 per cent) which came before the Board were decided unanimously. 
In fact, there were no dissenting votes at all in the 13 cases in which 
applications were denied. Among the 136 cases involving approvals, 
14 evoked one or more dissents. However, only one case drew three 
negative votes;!/ three cases drew two negative votes, and in 10 cases 
°nly one Member voted to deny. 
i 
Given this record of previous Board decisions in Florida 
holding company cases--and particularly in light of the earlier 
Southeast/Combanks cases--a troublesome question arises: 
to what 
elements in the present case can one point to explain such a dramatic 
break in the pattern of Board decisions which the majority is willing 
t o
 make? 
In all candor, I must say that I cannot identify any elements

which would justify approving the present proposal, and I can point to 
several reasons why it should be denied unanimously. 
Adverse Competitive Effects 
The majority admits that the merger would have adverse 
competitive effects in the Dade County banking market. United is 
not only present and competing in that market, it is the third-
ranking organization in the area—with 9.3 per cent of the total 
deposits, just behind Southeast Banking Corp. (24.2 per cent) and City 
NB Corp. (9.9 per cent). United has not been sitting by watching as 
its principal market area expanded. In 1969, it chartered a new bank; 
in 1970 it acquired an existing bank, and it opened a new bank in 1972. 
Moreover, among all of Florida banking institutions, United enjoyed 
°ne of the fastest internal rates of growth between 1965 and 1970. 
Thus, any slackening in the group's performance in recent years (as 
claimed in some of the material submitted to the Board) should be 
viewed as a temporary lapse from the long-run trend. 
The Board majority admits that--if this application were 
denied--First Florida probably would enter the Dade County banking 
Market. However, it concludes that the adverse competitive consequences 
r e
sulting from approval would not be substantial. I disagree strongly. 
In the first place, I believe that—if this application were denied — 
it is virtually certain that First Florida would be attracted to the 
Minmi mnrkftt—cither de novo or through a_foothold acquisition. 

r o i 
-7-
The company is already represented in six of the State's major banking 
markets, and its pace of expansion continues brisk. In 1972, it 
acquired one existing bank and opened three de novo banks. So far 
this year, it has acquired one existing bank, and it has another 
application pending for a proposed acquisition. 
Market Structure of Florida Banking 
Since this basic issue of potential competition between First 
Florida and United is at the core of this application, two fundamental 
questions must be answered: 
(1) What is the likelihood of First Florida 
entering the Dade County market--the home base of United? 
(2) How 
Probable is it that United will attempt to expand into the Tampa market--
the home base of First Florida--or into other markets in which First 
Florida is already competing? 
To answer these questions, one should 
have at least a rough appreciation of the market structure of commercial 
hanking in Florida and of the pattern of holding company participation 
in those markets. To facilitate this understanding, the 14 largest 
hanking markets in the State have been identified in Table 1. The 29 
multi-bank holding companies in the State have also been identified, 
a
s have been the number of banks and the amount of deposits they have 
in each of the principal market areas. 
Several features stand out in these data. Of the 14 market 
a
*eas, six are most important--each having $1.0 billion or more of total 
deposits. These are (1) Miami-Dade County ($3.8 billion); 
(2) Tampa-
St. Petersburg ($2.8 billion); (3) Fort Lauderdale ($1.6 billion); 
~~(4) Jacksonville ($1.5 billion); 
(5) West Palm Beach ($1.1 billion); 

-11-
525 
and (6) Orlando ($1.1 billion). 
In all of these six markets, multi-
bank holding companies play an important role, and in four of them these 
companies have two-thirds or more of the total deposits. 
In these six 
markets (plus two others: 
Lakeland and Melbourne-Titusville), at least 
six multi-bank holding companies have one or more subsidiaries. 
Still 
another important fact stands out in Table 1: Of the .29 multi-bank 
holding companies in Florida, only 12 have confined themselves to the 
acquisition of subsidiaries in a single banking market--while 17 have 
entered at least two of the 14 principal markets identified. 
Moreover, 
two of the 29 companies have entered 10 of the 14 markets, and 8 of 
them 
have bank subsidiaries in five or more of these markets. 
Finally, 
each of the top four holding companies has at least one subsidiary in 
the Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Orlando markets. 
Focusing specifically on the Miami-Dade County banking 
market, the following features should be noted. Of the 29 multi-
bank holding companies in the State, 14 have subsidiaries in that 
market; only four of these companies are purely local institutions, 
and 10 are active in other markets around the State. 
Furthermore, 
°f the 8 multi-bank holding companies that are active in five or 
more of the 14 leading markets, only two--Flrst Florida and Atlantic 
Bancorporation--do not have subsidiaries in the Miami-Dade County 
a
^ e a . 
It will also be noted that United has approximately the same 
volume of deposits as Pan American Bancshares ($384 million vs. 
$388 million, respectively). However, United has extended itself 
into only one other market--while Pan American has moved into five 
°f the State's 14 principal banking markets. 

-9-
The foregoing analysis of the structure of Florida's banking 
markets and the pattern of holding company participation point 
to an 
inescapable conclusion: 
both First Florida and United are caught up 
in a rapidly expanding network of multi-bank holding companies 
vigorously extending themselves Into the State's principal banking 
markets. 
Neither First Florida nor United can afford to stand aside 
from this development. 
Instead, one should anticipate that U n i t e d — 
under the impact of increasing banking competition (not only in Dade 
County but in the State as a whole) would find it mandatory to extend 
its reach into other major metropolitan areas. 
Otherwise it would 
atrophy and d e c l i n e — a prospect which United obviously would resist. 
Moreover, as the majority admits, First Florida can be expected to 
enter the Miami banking market in any case. 
This market extension 
almost certainly would occur regardless of the Board's action in this 
c
a s e . 
The only result of approving this application is to endorse 
and permit the consummation of a seriously anti-competitive merger 
carrying no substantial public benefits. 
*iack_pf public Benefits 
In fact, the parties themselves do not claim that the merger 
ttould make available any new services not already available in the 
relevant markets. 
They simply argue that--in combination--they can 
service their customers more efficiently. 
While the combined organiza-
tion could raise capital more advantageously, this is not a public 
benefit sufficient to offset the substantially adverse competitive 

-11-
527 
impact of the merger. Neither is the situation improved by the purported 
pro-competitive result claimed by the majority. They assert that 
. . as to the customer in need of wholesale and regional banking 
services, the proposal, rather than being anti-competitive, should in 
fact be pro-competitive by creating a fifth institution in the Miami 
market with established relationships in Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, 
Melbourne and other Florida communities and having in the aggregate 
resources of approximately $1 billion." This argument in support of 
anti-competitive banking combinations was declared invalid by the United 
States Supreme Court nearly a decade ago. In the Philadelphia National 
Bank-Girard Trust case, the merger parties attempted to overcome the 
anti-competitive effects of the proposal in the local area by emphasizing 
the beneficial competitive effects in the "wholesale" banking markets. 
The Court, in prohibiting the merger in June, 1963, rejected this 
argument. 
In so doing it observed that ". . . I f anti-competitive 
effects in one market could be justified by pro-competitive consequences 
in another, the logical upshot would be that every firm in an industry 
could, without violating Section 7, embark on a series of mergers that 
^ould make it in the end as large as the industry leader. For if all 
the commercial banks in the Philadelphia area merged into one, it would 
b
e smaller than the largest bank in New York C i t y . T h i s 
conclusion holds in the case of Florida banks today--for they, too, in 
combination, would not even equal the second largest bank in New York.

at 370 (1962).

528 
Financial Conditions and Managerial Resources 
The financial condition of the two holding companies and their 
managerial resources would enable them to expand independently of 
each other. The capital position of both groups of banks is generally 
satisfactory. Their managements are also quite able. Although United 
is the smaller of the merging organizations, its Chairman and President 
would become President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined 
group. The second ranking officer of the combined group would be 
Applicant's President, who would become Chairman of the Executive 
Committee. Other senior officers and directors would also be drawn 
from the two existing organizations. In general, the record shows 
that First Florida and United have a sizable cadre of able officials 
who are fully capable of expanding further the frontiers of their own 
°rganizations. Commercial banking in Florida would be far better off 
if they were left to do so separately. 
Concluding Observations 
Finally, I come away from the record in this case with a 
strong conviction. On the basis of the Board's record in previous 
Florida bank holding company cases--and after examining stage-by-
stage the evidence presented in this case--I would have predicted 
denial of this application by a substantial majority of the 
Board--and perhaps by a unanimous vote. It x^as impossible for me to 
°Verlook the obviously anti-competitive consequences, and I could 
n
°t fail to see the complete lack of any public benefits. I admit 

-12 
that considerable private benefits would accrue to the holding companies 
and their stockholders. However, these are not the factors which the 
Board must weigh under the Bank Holding Company Act. For the fore-
going reasons, I would deny the application.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BUCHER 
Approval of this application can only have an adverse effect 
°n the structure of Florida banking. First Florida is a rapidly growing 
hanking organization. Fourteen of it3 28 subsidiaries have been acquired 
^ the last three years and, in addition to the present proposal, it has 
Plans to acquire three additional banks in the near future. Its net income 
f
or 1971 showed an increase of over 25 per cent from the previous year. 
United has not undertaken as widespread expansion as First Florida. However, 
it is presently capable of doing so. It is a viable and growing organiza-
tion with its internal growth ranking among the best in the State. The 
^et result of the Board's action is to eliminate one viable competitor in 
the Florida banking market. In doing sc, the Board overlooks its previously 
stated recognition that one of the primary objectives of Congress in 
enacting § 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act was to "encourage a framework 
f
or banking structure consisting of as many separate and competitive banking 
organizations as can effectively and efficiently serve the convenience and 
needs of the banking public" (54 Federal Reserve Bulletin 925). 
The Board's action has the almost immediate effect of reducing 
^ e number of competitors in the Dade County market. The Dade County 
Market is the State's major banking market and is one of the most attractive 
f
°r entry as the ratio of population to banking office is 40 per cent 
greater than for the State as a whole. Additionally, the area ranks first 
in per capita income. The majority itself recognizes that were the pro-
posal to be denied,First Florida would certainly enter the Dade County 

535 
- 2 -
market in the near future. Such entry of an additional competitor would 
he far preferable to the acquisition of the third largest banking organiza-
tion in the market. 
Rather than seeing this proposal as an erosion of the highly 
competitive structure of Dade County banking, the majority finds it 
Pr©competitive as to the wholesale banking market. I believe that the 
market for such specialized services is already highly competitive and 
the addition of one more element in this market would have only a minor 
Procompetitive effect. This is particularly true since, despite having 
deposits of approximately $1 billion, the resulting institution would still 
he relatively small compared to the major competitors in the national 
hanking market. Any such effect is outweighed by the adverse effects on 
Potential competition in local banking markets throughout the State. 
Further, I am greatly concerned as to the effects of this 
a
Pproval on the long term competitive structure of Florida banking. 
I 
feel it is clear that, absent this proposal, First Florida and United 
w
ould be Statewide competitors in the relatively near future. The majority 
s
ees no adverse effects from this proposal in that there would still be 
2 6
 banking organizations with deposits over $100 million. The proposal 
d
°es not, however, merge two $100 million institutions, but rather merges 
a
 $587 million and a $384 million institution, the sixth and twelfth 
largest institutions in the State, respectively. As an indication of the 
magnitude of the proposal, a review of all Board decisions for the period 
^ 5 6 through 1972 indicates that the Board has only approved two holding 

536 
-11-
company formations where the resulting organization was larger than involved 
in this case. With respect to bank holding company acquisitions or mergers, 
only two have been approved where the deposits of the acquired institution 
were larger than those of United. There are only 17 holding companies in 
Florida with deposits over $200 million. Were all proposed mergers of which 
the Board has knowledge to be approved, as well as all reasonably likely 
mergers, there would only be 10 remaining holding companies with deposits 
in excess of $200 million. 
I realize that each application must be examined on its merits. 
However, this proposal is part of a clearly developing trend toward con-
centration in the Florida banking structure. Any such proposal should only 
be approved on a clear showing that approval is required by considerations 
bearing upon the public convenience and needs. The record in this case 
is devoid of any such considerations favoring approval. I would, there-
fore, deny the application.

"537 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
As indicated by the majority, this case has received an 
extraordinary amount of attention, as befits a case of this importance. 
I agree with Governor Brimmer and Governor Bucher that the application 
should be denied. My reasons are essentially the same as theirs, and 
hence there is no purpose to be served by reiteration. However, I 
would add just a note. 
To my dissent in the application of First International 
Bancshares, Inc., Dallas, Texas, to form a bank holding company through 
acquisition of successors to First National Bank in Dallas and Houston-
Citizens Bank & Trust Company, Houston (approved by the Board in 
% 
November 1972) (F.R. Bulletin, December 1972, p. 1028 et se^.) I 
attached an article by Art Buchwald describing an absurdly ludicrous 
result of mergers and mergers on top of mergers. 
I did so because, 
in a humorous way, Mr. Buchwald had put his finger on a real and 
important problem. At the time I did not regard the piece as in any 
v
a y prophetic. Now I am not so sure, because if I were the commanding 
official of a bank holding company, I would read the decision in this 
c
ase as letting down the bars. No longer would I think in terms of 
applying for permission to buy a bank here, another one there, and 
another one somewhere else. That takes time and lots of hard work. 
I would short-cut the laborious task of getting "big" by working toward 
a
 merger with another holding company, and thus acquire a whole parcel 
banks at one time (as here). But why should I think small? 
Why 
should I think in terms of acquiring just one holding company in my 

538 
-2-
State? Why not try to buy up several companies - rtaybe all but one 
of them - and merge them into mine? 
(I would want at least one to 
remain unaffiliated so that the Department of Justice could not assert 
that I was eliminating all competition, and possibly institute a 
legal action which would stymie the whole venture.) 
By this means I could achieve my principal purpose (which 
the majority opinion here seems to endorse), namely, to have a pool 
of lendable funds big enough to meet the borrowing desires of the 
biggest corporate businesses. I could do that by pooling the lendable 
funds of all my controlled banks - and profitably too, because it 
costs less to handle a few big loans than to handle many small ones. 
Of course, if I loaned a large portion of the funds of my 
b
anks to the big borrowers, there might not be enough left over to 
take care of local housing needs, small businesses, and consumers. 
But let someone else worry about that. Maybe they will be taken care 
by the saving and loan associations, the mutual savings banks, or 
the smaller commercial banks which have the ability and grit (of which 
it takes a lot these days) to remain independent of holding companies. 
However, I am not the commanding official of a bank holding 
company; rather, I am just one of seven Federal Reserve Governors, 
w
ith just one vote to cast out of seven. I cast it on the side of 
denial.
