Reports on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller 
of the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The Bank of Greenwood, Greenwood, Mississippi, into First 
National Bank of Jackson, Jackson, Mississippi, was approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller. The conclusion, which had been

revised in the light of comments made at the meeting on February 29, 
1968, read as follows: 
There is little, if any, competition between 
First National Bank of Jackson and The Bank of 
Greenwood, although there is some potential for 
competition between them through de novo branching. 
The Bank of Greenwood is by far the largest bank in 
the Greenwood area; since this position would be 
assumed by one of the two large banks in the State, 
the overall competitive effect is adverse. 
A report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Deposit Guaranty National 
Bank, Jackson, Mississippi, and City Bank & Trust Company, Natchez, 
Mississippi, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptrol-
ler. The conclusion read as follows: 
There is little, if any, competition between 
Deposit Guaranty National Bank, Jackson, Mississippi, 
and City Bank & Trust Company, Natchez, Mississippi, 
although there is potential for greater competition 
between them through de novo branching. City Bank 
& Trust Company is the largest bank in the Natchez 
area; since this position would be assumed by one 
of two large banks in the State, the overall com-
petitive effect is adverse. 
Report on S. 3097 (Item No. 1). Unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and 
Currency reporting on S. 3097, a bill "To amend the Defense Production 
Act of 1950, and for other purposes." A copy of the letter is attached 
as Item No. 1. 
Vault construction and protection (Item No. 2). 
Consideration 
of the Cincinnati Branch building program at the Board meeting on 

3/13/68 
-3-
February 13, 1968, revolved around questions relating to the use of 
18-inch walls as opposed to 24-inch walls, both reinforced with Steel-
crete, in the main security vaults of Federal Reserve Banks. The 
Divis ion of Bank Operations was requested to prepare a report that 
would bring together available information that might be considered 
by the Board in developing guidelines for Reserve Bank vault construc-
tion and protection. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated March 5, 
1968, from the Divis ion of Bank Operations that summarized and com-
mented on the various factors involved. On the basis of this analysis 
the Division recommended that (1) copies of the report be sent to all 
Reserve Banks for comment before any System-wide standards were set 
for vault construction; (2) a preference for 18-inch Steelcrete walls 
be indicated by the Board in those cases where Reserve Bank building 
programs demanded an early decision on vault specifications; and (3) 
the Board indicate a belief that the alarm systems and guard forces 
Â°f a Reserve Bank were more important than the thickness or reinforc-
ing of vault walls in protecting valuables, and should be put on a 
"fail safe" basis to the extent possible. 
At today's meeting Mr. Farrell reviewed in some detail the 
Principal topics covered in the document. Among other points he noted 
that there was some division of opinion on the question of construction 
of vault walls. Mr. Bouck of the Secret Service, who had been acting 

103 
3/13/68 
-4-
as the Board's consultant on security matters, doubted that the extra 
protection afforded by a 24-inch wall would be worth the extra cost; 
rather he recommended that every effort be made to insure strong guard 
forces and reliable alarm systems. In this connection the Division 
suggested that the subject of vault protection measures involving 
guards be discussed at the System conference of officers in charge of 
Reserve Bank protection departments that was to be held at the Board's 
building on Friday, March 15. Also, the Division of Bank Operations 
would continue to work toward the development of guidelines for Federal 
Reserve alarm systems. 
Mr. Farrell said that Mr. Witherell, the Board's Consulting 
Architect, had expressed the view that specifications for Federal 
Reserve vaults should meet more than the minimum requirement for top 
insurance ratings; accordingly, he recommended 24-inch Steelcrete 
walls for the new Cincinnati vault. A slight majority within the 
Divi sion of Bank Operations leaned toward 18-inch walls, with Steel-
crete reinforcing, as being sufficient. The minority agreed that such 
walls would probably be about as effective against penetration as the 
24-inch walls. However, they felt that the 24-inch Steelcrete walls 
would promote a better image of impregnability. 
At the instance of Governor Mitchell, there followed comments 
on the extent to which the factors now discussed by the Division of 
Bank Operations with respect to alarm and guard systems supplemented 

1.03 
3/13/68 
-5-
or went beyond the recommendations made by the Secret Service in its 
recent survey of protection at the Federal Reserve Banks and branches. 
There was general agreement that the factors now being discussed 
reached into new areas of the problem of protection. However, Governor 
Robertson noted that the experience gained in the surveys should be 
useful in developing recommendations that would remedy existing defi-
ciencies and provide guidelines for new installations. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that the Division memoran-
dum approached the problem too much in the vein that the Federal Reserve 
Banks were private rather than public institutions. From that point of 
view, several of the ideas set forth in the document seemed to him 
inappropriate. 
In particular he would object to hooking up the Reserve 
Banks to a system of outside surveillance that included commercial 
banks or other private institutions. 
Standards that might be appropri-
ate for the latter appeared to him inadequate for Federal Reserve pur-
poses. He pointed out certain parts of the memorandum that illustrated 
his concern. 
Mr. Farrell clarified that the tentative suggestions set forth 
in the memorandum were intended to be aimed almost exclusively at night 
and weekend protection. He explained alternative procedures that might 
be followed, with the advantages and weaknesses of each, and stressed 
the importance of the alarm and guard systems. The memorandum, he 
said, was intended principally to elicit comments and suggestions from 
a variety of sources.

Governor Robertson agreed that the current report should be 
regarded as just one step in a continuing study. In connection with 
the building program at Cincinnati, attention had focused on the ques-
tion of the thickness of the vault walls. Although this study empha-
sized that particular question, the Board and the Reserve Banks would 
benefit from distribution of the document as a vehicle for obtaining 
the views of everyone concerned on a number of questions relating to 
adequacy of protection. 
Governor Sherrill also agreed that the problem should be a 
matter of on-going study. The thickness of the vault wall was only 
one phase of the problem; other phases were as important, in fact more 
so. He suggested that if the memorandum was sent to the Reserve Banks, 
the point should be stressed. 
Governor Maisel suggested that several points needed clarifi-
cation. For example, in terms of cost-benefit analysis, what other 
benefits could be gained in exchange for less costly walls ? Another 
point related to procedures for dealing with hostages; if rules were 
not already in effect, they should be promulgated. Then there was the 
question of the responsibility, if any, of the national defense estab-
lishment with respect to protection of the vaults of the central bank. 
In further discussion additional areas for study were mentioned 
and suggestions made for changes in the memorandum that would meet some 
of the views expressed at today's meeting.

Unanimous approval was then given to a telegram to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland interposing no objection to revised plans 
and cost estimates for the new Cincinnati building that would include 
a vault the walls, floor, and ceiling of which would be of 18-inch 
concrete reinforced with Steelcrete. A copy of the telegram is 
attached as Item No. 2. 
It was understood that an amended version of the memorandum 
on vault construction and protection would be transmitted to the Presi-
dents of all Federal Reserve Banks for comment, after which the sub-
ject would be considered further by the Board. 
(A copy of the memo-
t 
randum, in the form in which it was subsequently transmitted, has been 
placed in the Board's files.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This refers to your letter of March 6, 1968 
requesting a report by the Board of Governors on the bill, 
S. 3097, "To amend the Defense Production Act of 1950, and 
for other purposes," which would extend that Act, as 
amended, for two years to June 30, 1970. Under the Board's 
Regulation V and pursuant to Title III of the Act and 
Executive Order No. 10480 dated August 14, 1953, the Federal 
Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents of the United States in 
issuing guarantees authorized by the various defense procure-
ment agencies, covering certain loans made by private lenders 
to finance production of goods and services considered 
essential to the national security. 
The Board has no objection to the proposed exten-
sion of this legislation. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.
