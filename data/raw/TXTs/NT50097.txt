Mr. James R. Smith, 
Assistant Counsel, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,

Dear Mr. Smith: 
This refers to your letter of May 4, 1967, in which you advised 
that Mr. Joseph A. Hall, III, Vice President and Comptroller of the 
Citizens and Southern National Bank has requested a ruling by the Board 
on the question whether it would be unlawful, under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956 ("the Act"), for Citizens and Southern Holding Company 
\ C&S ) to acquire, without prior Board approval, an entire issue of 
convertible debentures proposed to be issued by a bank in which the 
^olding company has a 5 per cent stock interest. It is understood that, 
ith respect to the proposed acquisition, the conversion right is desired 
nly for the purpose of enhancing the value of the debentures in the event 
* a later sale of them by C&S; and that under provisions of Georgia 
t,aW ( G e o- C o d e Ann. § 13-207) prohibiting a company from acquiring more 
ian 5 per cent of the voting shares of a bank, C&S would not be in a. 
osition to, and has no intention to, exercise the aforementioned con-
version rights. 
s t
 
l t i s the Board's view that, in the above-described circum-
^ances, section 3(a) of the Act does not make it unlawful, without prior 
^ard approval, for C&S to acquire such convertible debentures; but that 
iwould be unlawful, without prior Board approval, for said holding 
ac q
P a n y t 0 c o n v e r t such debentures into voting stock or otherwise to 
and k* d i r e c t o r indirect control of any stock of the said bank over 
above a 5 per cent interest. 
s e C f 
T h e B o a r d h a s a l s o examined the C&S proposal in the light of 
abo v
J O n 
o f t h e A c t a n d h a s concluded that, on the facts herein-
its ? f
S t a t e < 1> the proposed investment in convertible debentures, by 
With- 
a S 3 s i n g l e transaction, will not be deemed by the Board to fall 
for l n, t h e Provisions of section 4(a)(2) of the Act that make it unlawful 
b'1 ^ a n k h 0 l d i n S c o mP a ny "to engage in any business other than that 
anking or of managing or controlling banks".
