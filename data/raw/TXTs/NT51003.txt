Orting State Bank, Orting, Washington, and Eatonville State Bank, 
Eatonville, Washington, would eliminate only a small amount of

tration of deposits in the market's second ranking bank, and the 
overall effect on competition would be slightly adverse.

t h e Legal Division in a memorandum of December 12, 1972, the Board 
UnanimoUsly approved the request of First Security Corporation, Salt

the 
°ivision of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets 
Sect j 
n> after review of the nonbanking activities of First Railroad

termination of permanent grandfather authority under the Bank 
Ho • 
lng Company Act, but that property development activities proposed 
by 
company and by First Georgia Development Corporation be permitted 
y through leasing the property to outside developers. 
A question was raised during discussion whether Georgia Railroad 
Batlk & T 
•*• rust Company, the bank subsidiary of the holding company, made 
loaris to M 
cne nonbanking subsidiaries. Informal inquiry was made regard-
that Point during the meeting, and a report returned that there had 
be6n 1 Ho K

was intended. The Board thereupon unanimously agreed with the conclu-
sion of the staff and authorized issuance of a determination to that 
effect. A copy of the determination subsequently issued is attached 
a s Item No. 9. 
Grandfather privileges. In a memorandum of December 13, 1972, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Banking Markets 
Gction expressed the conclusion that Perpetual Corporation and Pierce 
National Life Insurance Company, both of Los Angeles, California, did 
n°t control Houston-Citizens Bank and Trust Company, Houston, Texas, 
° n dune 30, 1968, and therefore were not eligible for permanent grand-
father authority under the Bank Holding Company Act. 
The Board unanimously agreed with that conclusion and authorized 
lssuance of a determination to that effect. A copy of the determination 
fluently issued is attached as Item No. 10. 
Foreign joint ventures. At the meeting on December 14, 1972, 
Board deferred action on a staff proposal for definition of Board 
Po 1 i 
cy on the participation of U.S. banks in foreign joint ventures. 
rther analysis of policy considerations was contained in a memorandum 
December 18, 1972, from the Division of International Finance and 
the n-i 
division of Supervision and Regulation. 
At today's meeting suggestion was made that discussion of 
Policy question be deferred but that an attempt be made to arrive 
clsions regarding three applications that the Division of Supervision 

3739 
12/21/72 
-8-
and Regulation had presented in memoranda dated December 12 and cited 
a s illustrating the problems encountered in foreign investments in 
n°nfinancial businesses by Edge corporations and bank holding companies. 
Discussion indicated reluctance on the part of most of the 
members of the Board to make decisions on the individual applications 
without the guidance of an agreed-upon policy position. 
It was 
Suggested that the staff proposal for a policy statement be published 
comment and in the interim be used as a basis for decisions on the 
three applications. However, further comments resulted in agreement 
to expedite consideration of the policy question, in preparation for 
which the staff was requested to amplify its analysis of available 
a*ternatives in the light of the findings by Governors Mitchell and 
D a a n e regarding their recent study of foreign operations of U.S. banks.

Northwest Bancorporation. Today's agenda called for further 
consideration of the application of Northwest Bancorporation, Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, to acquire shares of Farmers and Merchants State Bank of 
Stillwater, Stillwater, Minnesota. Action on the application was 
deferred in late 1971 pending a public hearing, which was held early 
In 1972. In a memorandum of November 1, 1971, the Division of Super-
Vlsion and Regulation recommended denial, as did the Banking Markets 
c 
ection. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and its Bank Exami-
nations Department recommended approval, while the Bank's Research 
Apartment recommended denial. These recommendations were reiterated 
after receipt of the report of the hearing examiner. Discussion at 
feting on November 22, 1972, indicated that of the members of the 
d 
three 
^°ard then present, three were disposed to deny the application and 
were disposed to approve it. Action was again deferred until 
a time when all members could participate. 
At today's meeting Chairman Burns and Governors Mitchell, 
> and Sheehan voted for approval, while Governors Robertson and 
Br i 
mmer voted for denial. Governor Bucher at first expressed an adverse 
P°siti0n but later said that, since he regarded the considerations as 
ab0u t-
UL evenly balanced, he would vote with the majority for approval. 
The application was thereupon approved, Governors Robertson 
and R 
nrimmer dissenting. It was understood that implementing documents 
°uld be drafted for the Board's consideration, and that a dissenting 
stat-ement or statements might also be prepared.

Reserve Bank officer. Governor Sheehan stated that the Commit-
tee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans recommended that 
the Board interpose no objection to the appointment of Edwin S. Willock 
a s General Auditor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, effective 
January 1, 1973. He distributed to the members of the Board a draft 
letter that would so inform the Reserve Bank. 
Discussion included suggestions for changes in the letter, and 
i f-was understood that Governor Sheehan, with Messrs. Holland and 
^cIntosh, would develop revisions to reflect the views expressed. The 
^°ard unanimously approved the sending of the letter as thus revised. 
A 
copy 0f 
letter in the form in which it was transmitted is attached

Budge t review. The Board unanimously agreed to defer final 
action on its 1973 budget and on the budgets of the Federal Reserve 
^anks f o r tfie first half of 1973, and to authorize the Federal Reserve 
B a n k s to continue spending at current rates for the time being, it 
expected that final action would be taken on their budgets for 
the first haif Qf 1973 by j a n u ary 15, 1973. A copy of the telegram 
sent co the Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 14, It was also 
that review of the salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presi-
dent 
b or the Federal Reserve Banks would be deferred, but that when 
thesp 
salaries were approved they would be made retroactive to Jan-
Uacy 1, 1973.

. Adjustment of salary schedule. In a memorandum of December 21, 
the Division of Personnel Administration noted that, based on 
recommendations by the Office of Management and Budget and the Civil 
Service Commission as a result of a comparison of Federal salaries with 
average private enterprise salaries, President Nixon had signed an 
executive order providing an average 5.14 per cent increase in the 
General Schedule covering classified Federal employees. In keeping 
^th the Board's policy of maintaining its employees' salary structure 
c°mParable to that of the other agencies of the Federal Government, 
the 
e Division recommended that the Board approve a revision of its 
Regular Salary Schedule, effective January 7, 1973. The proposed 
evision, which was attached to the memorandum, was identical to the 
revised Government General Schedule. 
The Board unanimously approved the revised schedule. A copy 
the Division's memorandum is attached as Item No. 15. 
The Board delegated to Governor Sheehan discretionary authority 
§rarit relief from the promotion and hiring freeze recently instituted 
£ o 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. 
The meeting then adjourned.

FIRST STATE BANCSHARES CORPORATION 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
First State Bancshares Corporation, Wellston, Missouri, has 
aPPlied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding 
ConiPany Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding 
c°mPany through acquisition of 100 per cent of the voting shares (less 
Sectors' qualifying shares) of First State Bank & Trust Company, 
Alston, Missouri (v First State"), First North County Bank and Trust 
CoinPany, Jennings, Missouri ("First North County"), and First Northwest 
Bank> St. Ann, Missouri ("First Northwest"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
perSons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
p r 
3<b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
and none has been timely received. The Board has considered the 
aPPHcation in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
(l2 U-S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant was organized in 1970 for the purpose of becoming 
Citibank bank holding company with respect to the three proposed 
banks. Consummation of the proposal herein would result in 
Applicant controlling approximately $193.7 million in deposits, repre-
6nting 1.5 p e r 
c e n t 
0f total commercial bank deposits in the State, 
Applicant would thereby become the tenth largest banking organization 
in Missouri. 
X/ Bank deposit data are as of June 30, 1972. 

-2-
All three proposed subsidiary banks are located in the St. 
0uis banking market and the distance separating any two of them ranges 
between 4 3/4 and 11 miles. First State ($80.8 million in deposits) 
c°ntrols 1.42 per cent of market deposits and ranks as the 12th largest 
0f ^ e i n banks in the market; it is located on the fringe of the city 
*llnits of St. Louis in an area which has shown some economic decline in 
t e C e n t years. First North County ($81.1 million in deposits) controls 
1.42 
Per cent of market deposits, ranks as the 11th largest bank in the 
Hiatket-
» and is located in an area which has experienced considerable 
Mansion i n the past several years. First Northwest ($31.8 million in 
P°sits) controls 0.56 per cent of market deposits, ranks as the 53rd 
r8est bank in the market, and is also located in an area characterized 
y sl8nificant growth. 
As indicated in the record, there is no significant existing 
^etition between the three proposed subsidiary banks due, in part, to 
° n shareholder control.*^ There is some overlap of service area 
aiU°n£ th 
n e subsidiary banks; however, because of the many alternative 
s°utces n f , 
o t banking services existing in the relevant market and in view

of the long-standing affiliation between the banks, the effects of con-
summation of the proposal on existing competition will be insignificant. 
in view of the strong affiliations, it appears unlikely that any 
substantial amount of future competition will develop. The Board concludes 
that consummation of this proposal would not have an adverse effect on 
competition between competing banks in the market nor on the concentration 
of banking resources. 
The financial condition and«managerial resources cf Applicant 
a n d its proposed subsidiaries are generally, satisfactory although the 
CaPital positions of the banks- are somewhat low. Prospects of all are 
favorable in view of Applicant's proposal to add up to four million 
hilars i n equity capital to the subsidiaries and these considerations there 
f r» 
r e lend weight toward approval. Considerations relating to the 
l e n i e n c e 
and needs of the communities to be served are consistent with 
aPproval. It is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction 
W°Ulti be in the public interest and that the application should be 
aPproved. 
• 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
r e a so n s summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated (a)

on appears remote. Moreover, in view of the relatively 
Slnall size of Bank, its localized service area, and the presence 
OjF 
a number of intervening banks, it appears that consummation of Applicant's 
pt0Poaal would not eliminate any meaningful existing or future competition 
between Bank and any of Applicant's subsidiary banks. Nor would consura-
5lation of this proposal raise barriers to entry by other bank holding 
Sanies into the expanding Houston market because of the large number 
Affiliated 
banks which will remain in this area after this transaction. 
On the record before it, the Board concludes that consummation 
of A 
PPlicant's proposal would not result in a monopoly nor be in further-
ance nf 
or any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business 
bai*king i n a n y a r e a > n o r have any substantially anticompetitive effect. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of Applicant 
a n d its 
U 
subsidiaries appear satisfactory and future prospects of all 
favorable. The financial condition, management resources and pro-
mts of ti. i 
, 
°ani'., as a subsidiary of Applicant, appear consistent with approval 
th-f 
s aPPlication. Soon after acquisition, Applicant has agreed to 
a e n the somewhat low capital position of Bank through the immediate 
Hlitio n °f capital funds. Although the banking needs of residents of Bank's 
a 
r ea are adequately served by existing institutions operating in •* 
spe 
Of

uSh A Pplicant in Bank's service area should contribute positively to 
the

c°nsiderations are consistent with approval of this application.

NORTH SHORE CAPITAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
North Shore Capital Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
h a s applied for the Board's approval under 5 3(a)(1) of the 
Bat*k Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation 
o f a bank holding company through acquisition of 50 per cent 
°r more of the voting shares of The North Shore National Bank 
o f Chicago, Chicago, Illinois ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given 
i n accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing com-
ments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the 
aPPlication and all comments received in light of the factors 
8 e t forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant is a newly-formed organization and has no 
°Perating history. Upon acquisition of Bank ($105.8 million 
o f ^posits), Applicant would control 0.3 per cent of the com-
m e t c l a l bank deposits in Illinois. (All banking data are as of 
30» 1972.) The Board notes that the principals of Appli-
cant 
r e also principals of four other one-bank holding com-
b e s i n i n i n o i S ) w h i c h h o l d deposits of $52, $36, $24, and $7 
mill J 
i0n> respectively. However, consummation of the proposed transaction 

-2-
not likely to adversely affect existing competition in that 
tlle service areas of the other banks controlled by these 
principals do not appear to overlap with that of Bank. The 
barest of these, Citizen's National Bank of Chicago, is 
^Proximately 12 miles distant from Bank. 
On Hay 2, 1972, the Board denied an application by 
applicant to become a bank holding company through the acqui-
8ition of shares of Bank (1972 Federal Reserve Bulletin 809). 
Th 
denial was based on the Board's conclusions that the 
"proposed transaction represented an assumption by Appli-
cant nf an excessive amount of debt to be retired over an 
X C e S s i v e length of time; that the then-proposed financing 
Plan 
apparently would prevent Applicant from meeting the 
esent and future capital needs of Bank; and that the then-
°Posed transaction contemplated payment by Bank of an apparently 
jUstified 
flnnual "consulting" fee to Applicant that would 
operat 
e unduly to the detriment of minority shareholders of Bank. 
The 
lnstant application represents a substantial modification of 
APPU( 
B°ard 
car*t's original proposal. Under the present proposal, the 
concludes that the leverage contemplated is not excessive 
9tld th 
a t no unfair treatment of minority shareholders is involved. 
The 
Proposed "consulting fee" has been eliminated. Applicant's 
tot*l a 
ucquisition debt will be significantly less than that 

; 3755 
-3-
origitially proposed; its equity capital significantly greater. 
Although Applicant intends to incur additional debt to augment 
Bank's equity capital base, its total debt to equity ratio 
W o u l d still be less than that contemplated by the original proposal, 
Utlder the instant proposal Applicant's projected earnings appear 
to be sufficient to service the debt which it will incur upon 
Co Summation of the proposed transaction, without adversely 
Meeting Bank's capital structure. The Board therefore con-
C l u d e s that the financial and managerial resources and future 
pr°spects of Applicant are satisfactory. In view of Applicant's 
^Pressed intention to infuse additional equity capital into 
Bank t-u 
> cne financial and managerial resources and prospects 
of 
n K are also considered satisfactory since Bank would have 
CaPital account positioned for growth. 
Although the convenience and needs of the communities 
to b e served are already adequatedly being served, consummation 
of t, 
e Proposed acquisition would provide the added flexibility 
•^ent in a holding company structure. Considerations relating 
to the o 
convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
etefore lend slight weight for approval. It is the Board's 
8n)ent that the transaction would be in the public interest 
and 
for 
t^ a t the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
fch 
6 reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not 
°nsummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following

Georgia Railroad (incorporated in 1833) conducted both a

Section 2(b) of the Act defines "company covered in 1970" as
