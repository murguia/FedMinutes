Mr. Martin W. Bergin, 
Secretary, Retirement System, 
of the Federal Reserve Banks, 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 
New York, New York. 10045 
Dear Mr. Bergin: 
By means of a letter dated September 30, 1965 the Retire-
ment System was advised that the Board of Governors interposed no 
objection to increasing the benefits under the Board Plan of the 
Retirement System of the Federal Reserve Banks to conform to the 
increased benefits provided by Public Law 89-205 to retirees and 
survivor-annuitants of the Civil Service Retirement System. 
The U. S. Civil Service Commission recently announced 
that, as a result of a further rise in the Consumer Price Index of 
3 per cent or more over the base month of October 1966, an addi-
tional cost-of-living increase of 3.9 per cent effective May 1, 
1968, will be granted to those annuitants and survivor-annuitants 
on the retirement rolls as of April 30, 1968. This increase is 
also applicable to the future annuity of each designated survivor 
of a retiree on the rolls as of April 30, 1968. 
The Board of Governors has approved the payment of the 
cost of providing these latest increases on a "terminal-funding" 
basis. as was done in the case of the cost-of-living increases 
effective January 1, 1966 and January 1, 1967. Therefore, it will 
be appreciated if the Retirement System would bill the Board for 
the amount the Actuary determines is necessary to fund the 3.9 
Per cent increase over the life-expectancy of the annuitants and 
survivor-annuitants on the rolls as of May 1, 1968, plus the desig-
nated survivor-annuitants of those retirees on the rolls as of 
that date. 

Mr. Martin W. Bergin 
- 2 -
There is enclosed a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Aubrey 
N. Heflin, President, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, authorizing 
the Bank to pay to the Retirement System the sum which the Actuary de-
termines necessary to fund a similar increase in the annuity of Mrs. 
Maurice P. Flagg.

Dear Mr. Heflin: 
Following the Civil Service Commission Retirement System's 
recent announcement of an increase of 3.9 per cent in the annuities 
°f its retired employees and survivors, effective May 1, 1968, a 
similar increase is being made in the annuities of the retired 
employees and survivors of the Board Plan of the Retirement System 
°f the Federal Reserve Banks. 
In order that the widow of Mr. Maurice P. Flagg may con-
tinue to receive the same benefits as those payable under the Board 
Plan, as outlined in your Bank's letter of September 9, 1955, the 
Board of Governors authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 
to pay to the Retirement System of the Federal Reserve Banks the 
amount determined necessary to fund an increase of 3.9 per cent in 
her annuity for the period of her remaining life. 
It is understood that the Retirement System will bill the 
fiank for the cost of funding this benefit as soon as this cost has 
been determined by the Actuary. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland, 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.
