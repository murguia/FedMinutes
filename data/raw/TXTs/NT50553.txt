Boston building program. On December 11, 1969, the Board 
had authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to spend $9,853,000 
for the purchase of eight of nine parcels of real estate composing a 
new building site. In a letter of December 19 the Bank requested 
authorization to spend an additional $287,650 representing real 
estate commissions on five of the eight parcels, that amount having 
been omitted from the costs mentioned earlier by the Reserve Bank. 
Pursuant to the recommendation in a memorandum from the 
Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations dated December 24, 1969, 
the Reserve Bank's request was approved unanimously. A copy of the 
telegram sent to the Bank is attached as Item No. 3. 
Interest Equalization Tax. The Bureau of the Budget had 
requested the Board's views on a proposal by the Treasury under which 
the exemption of certain Japanese debt obligations from the Interest 
Equalization Tax would be terminated. 
After comments by Governor Brimmer favorable to the proposal, 
unanimous approval was given to a reply to the Budget Bureau in the 
form attached as Item No. 4. 
Monetary Fund matters. Governor Brimmer commented on, and dis 
tributed material prepared by the staff with respect to, problems 
being encountered by the International Monetary Fund incident to the 
forthcoming increase in Fund quotas.

Governor Daane reported his understanding that the Executive 
Board of the Fund appeared to be moving toward a fundamental decision 
on the question of purchases of South African gold by member countries. 
Reserve Bank budgets. Pursuant to the understanding at the 
meeting on December 22, 1969, further consideration was given to the 
proposed budgets of the Federal Reserve Banks and branches for the 
first half of 1970. 
With respect to a suggestion by the Division of Federal 
Reserve Bank Operations that the Atlanta Reserve Bank might be asked 
to postpone its plans for a money museum (an educational exhibit that 
would be located in the head office building), Governor Brimmer sum-
marized discussion that he had had with President Kimbrel concerning 
the project, which he said was thought of primarily as a display that 
would be of interest to visitors to the Bank building. 
Governor 
Brimmer noted that the cost involved would be relatively modest and 
recommended that no objection be interposed. Other members of the 
Board agreed that the budget provision should not be questioned. 
The remainder of the discussion concerning the Reserve Bank 
budgets was devoted to questions that had been raised at the December 22 
meeting with respect to the exercise of surveillance, on an ongoing 
basis, over plans of the respective Banks for expansion or upgrading 
of data processing systems. Pursuant to a suggestion that had been 
made at the earlier meeting, it was agreed that a letter should be 
sent to the Reserve Banks asking them to submit information with 

3936 
12/24/69 
-4-
regard to their present data processing systems. Such a census, 
it was thought, would provide a starting point from which to work 
out procedures for monitoring new computer projects as they were 
developed around the System. 
As to arrangements that might be made for building up within 
the Board's staff a capability for intelligent review of Reserve 
Bank plans for major changes in data processing hardware, several 
alternatives were explored. Governor Sherrill then commented that 
one possibility would be to assign overall leadership responsibility 
for such an undertaking to the Division of Federal Reserve Bank 
Operations, with technical advice from the Division of Data Pro-
cessing and perhaps other sources. It was agreed, however, that 
the matter should be studied at more length. Accordingly, Governor 
Sherrill was assigned responsibility for developing a satisfactory 
surveillance arrangement and for advising the Reserve Banks of the 
procedures to be followed. 
The proposed budgets of the Federal Reserve Banks were then 
accepted, but with the understanding that the New York Bank would be 
asked to submit additional information on a proposed expansion and 
upgrading of computer facilities for the research function before 
committing itself to a study by a computer software firm for which 
$60,000 had been provided in the budget.

A copy of the telegram sent to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Boston reflecting acceptance of its budget for the first half 
of 1970 is attached as Item No. 5; the telegrams sent to the other 
Banks, except New York, were similar in form. A copy of the telegram 
sent to the New York Bank is attached as Item No. 6. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, 
Kakalec, and Halley withdrew at this point. 
Board Budget. Upon resumption of discussion with respect 
to the Board's budget for calendar 1970, Governor Maisel expressed 
the view that it was important at this stage to develop a statement 
of principles. Referring to the posture of the Federal Government 
as a whole, he noted that the Budget Director was being asked to 
hold increases to about 4 per cent, whereas there were built-in 
requirements of 8 or 9 per cent, which meant cutting back programs 
in place to meet the goals of fiscal policy. The Board, he felt, 
should be cognizant of that situation and guide itself accordingly. 
Therefore, he would think in terms of a maximum Board budget for 
1970 of approximately $18.5 million, which was the level of the program-
in-place budget. He would then review the additional items included 
in the capability budget and make allowance for those that were approved 
by requiring equivalent cuts in the program-in-place budget. The 
manner in which those cuts could be made might be left to the dis-
cretion of the respective division heads, subject to approval by 

3938 
12/24/69 
-6-
Governor Sherrill, and the decisions could be finalized over the 
next month or two. 
Governor Maisel added that he thought it was poor budget 
procedure simply to build from a given base. The appropriate pro-
cedure, in his opinion, would be to begin by cutting a stipulated 
amount percentagewise from the program-in-place budget and to require 
justification each year. 
Governor Sherrill agreed that an exercise of the kind pro-
posed by Governor Maisel was a standard aspect of program budgeting 
procedure. It had not been followed this year, he said, mainly be-
cause of pressures of time and because it was a difficult procedure 
to initiate. 
There followed a discussion of the overall guidelines that 
had been suggested by Governor Maisel. Three members (Governors 
Daane, Brimmer, and Sherrill) indicated that they would prefer to 
approach the budget for 1970 by concentrating on the items contained 
in the capability budget but not in the program-in-place budget. In 
going through such a process they would evaluate the items, perhaps 
assign different orders of priority from those assigned by the divisions, 
and choose among the items on a selective basis. They might also add 
certain items not provided for in the capability budget. In terms of 
the total budget, they would not be too concerned if it approached the 
level of the capability budget. 

3933 
12/24/69 
-7-
In support of their reasoning the three members observed, 
among other things, that an increasing level of responsibilities 
was being assigned to the Board, that some expansion appeared to be 
required in order to meet those responsibilities without sacrificing 
quality of performance, that the Board had deliberately followed 
stringent budget policies for a number of years, and that a certain 
amount of catching-up therefore seemed to be justified if the Board's 
functions were to be discharged adequately. They also suggested that 
at times like the present when the country was faced with critical 
economic and financial problems, responsibilities of the kind per-
formed by the Board appeared to deserve a higher priority, when 
thought of in budget terms, than those performed by certain other 
agencies of the Government. Similarly, the Board's budget was not 
in the same order of magnitude as those of the major departments and 
agencies of the Government, and a moderate increase therein, though 
it appeared substantial percentagewise, could result in an ability to 
contribute more significantly in vital areas. 
It was stated at this point that Chairman Martin had expressed 
his desire not to participate in decisions on the Board's budget for 
1970. In reply to a question from the Acting Chairman, the view was 
expressed that Governor Robertson's general budget philosophy would 
be similar to that of Governor Maisel. 
Governor Mitchell commented that in principle he was inclined 
to sympathize with the position that the Board should not exceed a 

39* 10 
12/24/69 
-8-
certain budget level and also with the view that there should be 
some retrenchment mixed with expansion. He then explored the possi-
bility of deferring final budget decisions, perhaps even until after 
the new Chairman of the Board had assumed his duties. For a variety 
of reasons, however, a delay of more than a temporary nature did not 
appear feasible, and other Board members indicated that they were 
prepared to proceed. Accordingly, Governor Mitchell suggested that 
the Board move forward with a review of the proposed division budgets 
against the background of the presentations that had previously been 
made concerning them, with the understanding that the right was re-
served to ascertain the views of Governor Robertson on any narrow 
issues if that should appear desirable. 
Governor Sherrill then called attention to a document in 
which the Controller had estimated the cost of certain activities 
not provided for in the division budgets as originally submitted but 
mentioned during the Board meeting of December 19, 1969. After dis-
cussion of those items, it was decided that provision for the conduc-
ting of a second survey of consumer awareness of credit terms ($100,000) 
should not be included in the budget of the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation, although the staff could present the proposal for con-
sideration by the Board during the year as a special item if it so 
desired. It was decided to include in the budget of the Division of 
Federal Reserve Bank Operations an amount of $75,000 for architectural 

39 
12/24/69 
-9-
consulting services and to include in the budget of the Division 
of Personnel Administration three items totaling $37,000 to provide 
for recruiting among minority groups and for additional training 
opportunities. For the Division of Administrative Services, it was 
decided to include in the budget $23,600 for improvement of cafeteria 
services (Governor Maisel dissenting) and $25,800 to provide for 
additional cars and chauffeurs (Governor Maisel favoring the inclusion 
of only $16,400 for that purpose). Other items included in the Con-
troller's tabulation were rejected. 
The Board then reviewed the capability budgets of several 
divisions and decided upon certain adjustments therein, among them 
deletion of funds provided in the budget of the Division of Research 
and Statistics for conducting a business loan survey and deletion of 
funds provided in the budget of the Office of the Secretary for power 
file equipment. Although Governor Maisel did not disagree with the 
deletions, his preferred approach would have been to award only a 
percentage of the dollar amounts included in the capability (but not 
the program-in-place) budgets. 
It was understood that the Board would review the capability 
budgets of the remaining divisions later. 
The following staff members returned to the room at this 
point: Messrs. Molony, Farrell, Solomon (Supervision and Regulation), 
Kiley, and Mcintosh, and Mrs. Semia. The following additional staff

Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of The Commercial Bank and 
Trust Company of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, with 
Citizens Bank of South Carolina, Dillon, South Carolina, was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpor-
ation, the conclusion reading as follows: 

12/24/69 
-11-
There is no competition existing between 
The Commercial Bank and Trust Company of South 
Carolina, Columbia, and Citizens Bank of South 
Carolina, D i l l o n , and there would seem to be only 
a remote potential for development of competition 
between them in the foreseeable future. Thus, the 
proposed merger would have no adverse competitive 
effects. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the 
proposed purchase of assets and assumption of deposit liabilities 
of Bank of Grand Cane, Grand Cane, Louisiana, by First National 
Bank in Mansfield, Mansfield, Louisiana, was approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency, the conclusion 
reading as follows: 
The proposed acquisition of Bank of Grand 
Cane, Grand Cane, Louisiana, by First National 
Bank in Mansfield would eliminate such competition 
as exists between them. Due to the small size 
of Bank of Grand Cane and its limited competitive 
capability, the potential for greater competition 
appears minimal. Overall, effect of the proposal 
on competition would be no more than slightly adverse. 
Government check procedures. A letter to the Fiscal 
As sistant Secretary of the Treasury with regard to Federal Reserve 
participation in a proposed study of Government check procedures was 
approved unanimously. A copy is attached as Item No. 7. 
Rights of the Congress to information. A letter to Chairman 
Moss of the Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee 
Â°f the House Committee on Government Operations in response to his 
letter of November 7, 1969, presenting several questions with regard 

12/24/69 
-12-
to the basic rights of the Congress to information was approved 
unanimously. A copy is attached as Item No. 8. 
Emergency credit assistance. In a memorandum of July 3, 
1969, the Division of Research and Statistics had outlined a con-
tingency plan for providing emergency credit assistance to nonmember 
depositary institutions in the event liquidity problems at such in-
stitutions became widespread. That plan had focused on aid to 
mutual savings banks and nonmember commercial banks because the 
Federal Home Loan Bank System appeared to have ample resources to 
meet any immediately foreseeable call on its responsibility as 
lender of last resort to the savings and loan industry. 
With a memorandum of December 23, 1969, the Research 
Division provided an updating of its earlier contingency plan. 
Activation thereof would be accomplished by the sending of a letter 
to the Federal Reserve Banks containing groundrules and authorization 
for the extension of emergency credit assistance. With the letter 
there would be transmitted selected passages from the section on 
emergency credit assistance of the System Committee Report on Re-
appraisal of the Federal Reserve Discount Mechanism; the sending of 
those passages would indicate endorsement by the Board of the princi-
ples set forth therein. 
However, the December 23 memorandum pointed out that it 
n
ow appeared to be a distinct possibility that the Home Loan Bank 

394 
12/24/69 
-13-
System would not have sufficient resources of its own to continue 
serving the savings and loan associations as an effective lender of 
last resort. This suggested that a decision on the part of the 
Board to activate an emergency credit assistance program should 
include provision for aid to the savings and loans. It appeared 
to the Board's staff that any Federal Reserve program of emergency 
credit assistance to the savings and loan industry could be most 
effective if such assistance were provided through the Federal Home 
Loan Banks, either under the last paragraph of section 13 of the 
Federal Reserve Act or under a conduit loan arrangement, rather than 
directly to individual savings and loan associations. That approach 
could be activated more quickly than other alternatives, and problems 
of coordination with the Home Loan Bank System would be minimized. 
Nevertheless, the memorandum pointed out, the Federal Reserve 
Board was hardly in a position to make a final decision at this junc-
ture since an anticipated document from the Home Loan Bank Board 
evaluating possible means of providing emergency Federal Reserve 
assistance to the savings and loan industry had not yet been received. 
(Note: During today's meeting it was reported that the Bank Board 
paper was en route.) 
In the circumstances, while there was a general discussion 
of incorporation into a Federal Reserve program of plans for emergency 
credit assistance to the savings and loan industry, it was recognized 

3946 
12/24/69 
-14-
that a decision would have to be deferred. The comments made 
indicated that the conclusion of the Board's staff that it would 
be preferable to extend assistance through the Home Loan Banks 
rather than directly to savings and loan associations was supported 
generally by the members of the Board. When it came to savings and 
loan associations that were not members of the Home Loan Bank System, 
there was some difference of opinion. At least one Board member 
felt rather strongly that it would be desirable to work out an arrange-
ment whereby the Home Loan Banks would function as intermediaries; 
however, it was not clear whether that would be acceptable to the 
Home Loan Bank Board, and one Board member expressed the view that 
pressure should not be exerted on the Bank Board. In any event, a 
decision could not be made on that point at this stage, and it was 
noted that only a relatively small segment of the savings and loan 
industry was involved. For the present, the possibility of provid-
ing emergency Federal Reserve credit assistance to such institutions, 
either on a direct or conduit basis, would be established under the 
terms of the authorization contained in the proposed letter to the 
'â¢S-*'.V.;' 
. 
Federal Reserve Banks. 
Subject to the understanding that the question of making 
emergency credit assistance available to the savings and loan industry 
generally would be considered further at a later date, today's dis-
cussion indicated that the members of the Board were prepared to 

3947 
12/24/69 
-15-
activate the contingency plan for providing emergency credit 
assistance to other types of nonmember depositary-type institutions 
by transmitting appropriate guidelines and authorization to the 
Federal Reserve Banks. 
(Note: As to life insurance companies, the 
staff concluded in the December 23 memorandum that the extent of 
any further liquidity squeeze in the near term was not likely to 
be sufficient to warrant a special Federal Reserve assistance 
program for those institutions. No view to the contrary was ex-
pressed at today's meeting.) 
Certain minor technical adjustments, as suggested by the 
staff, in the proposed letter to the Federal Reserve Banks were 
accepted by the Board. The principal discussion therefore related 
to suggestions that had been made by the Committee on Discounts and 
Credits of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
with respect to an earlier draft letter, as follows: (1) that refer-
ences to rates that would be charged on advances to or discounts for 
member banks that were providing conduit loans to nonmember institutions 
be deleted: 
and (2) that the rate charged on loans by member banks to 
nonmember institutions under conduit loan arrangements be required to 
be the same as that charged by Reserve Banks under the last paragraph 
of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act. 
The question of what statements to include in the letter to 
the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to rates was debated at some 

3948 
12/24/69 
-16-
length and several possible alternatives were mentioned, including 
the option of not making any statement with regard to rates at this 
time. Two Board members (Governors Daane and Sherrill) were inclined 
toward taking advantage of that option. Eventually, however, it was 
decided that the statement of principles in the letter, as it applied 
to conduit loans (indirect extensions of credit to nonmember institu-
tions through a member bank or banks) should include a statement that 
it would be desirable that the rate charged be no more than two per-
centage points above the rate set on advances under section 10(b) of 
the Federal Reserve Act. It was also decided to retain in the letter 
the suggestion contained in the draft that the rate on advances to 
individuals, partnerships, and corporations other than member banks 
under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Act be established uni-
formly in all Federal Reserve districts at 7-1/2 per cent. 
Unanimous approval then was given to the sending of a letter 
to the Federal Reserve Banks in the form attached as Item No. 9. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, 
Kakalec, and Halley then withdrew from the meeting. 
Board budget. The Board resumed its consideration of the 
Board budget for 1970 and reviewed the proposed budgets of the 
remaining divisions, that is, those whose budgets had not been reviewed 
earlier during this meeting, with the results summarized in the follow-
ing paragraphs. 

394 
12/24/69 
-17-
As to the Division of International Finance, the full 
capability budget was approved, although Governor Maisel would 
have favored reducing somewhat the amount provided for travel. 
Governor Maisel also expressed the view that a relatively low 
priority should be assigned to studies of economic trends in less-
developed countries. After some discussion of that point, and of 
a suggestion by Governor Brimmer that consideration be given to a 
more extensive travel program incorporating visits to areas not 
generally visited by members of the Board and staff, Governor 
Sherrill observed that from the standpoint of the budget the 
questions involved were not particularly significant and that the 
basic issues appeared to deserve study within a somewhat different 
framework. 
The full capability budget of the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation was approved except for one item in the amount of 
$35,000, the reduction reflecting an understanding that the Division 
would negotiate with the Federal Reserve Banks to ascertain their 
willingness to assume part of the cost of the program designed to 
Provide special training for bank examiners in electronic data pro-
cessing techniques. 
For the Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations the 
capability budget was approved, Governor Maisel stating that he would 
have favored providing for the high priority items only. 

3950 
12/24/69 
-18-
The high priority items in the capability budget of the 
Division of Personnel Administration were approved, with the 
notation that the Board also had approved earlier during this 
meeting the inclusion of certain other items not contained in 
the capability budget as submitted by the Division. 
For the Division of Administrative Services, the Board 
approved everything listed in the high priority section of the 
capability budget except a $27,000 item for public information 
facilities and also approved, on a selective basis, several items 
in the remainder of the capability budget. These were in addition 
to the items not included in the budget, as originally submitted, 
that had been acted upon by the Board previously during this 
meeting. 
The capability budget of the Office of the Controller was 
approved, along with the budget submitted by the Office of Defense 
Planning. 
For the Division of Data Processing, Governor Maisel sug-' 
gested a flat increase of $100,000 over the program-in-place budget. 
However, after discussion of the extent to which user requirements 
W e
r e mirrored in the Division's budget and a statement by Governor 
Sherrill that in another year arrangements might be made to push 
some of the budget back to the using divisions, the Board approved 
approximately half of the items listed in the capability budget, with 

3951 
12/24/69 
-19-
the understanding that Governor Sherrill could return to the Board 
during 1970 for further consideration of the Division's program if 
The Controller reported that after making adjustments 
reflecting the Board's decisions the overall budget figure stood 
at $20.3 million. 
Governor Maisel then moved that a cut of $1 million be made 
from the proposed budget so as to establish an expenditure ceiling 
of $19.3 million, which would be approximately $800,000 in excess 
of the amount necessary to continue programs in place. The motion 
was lost for lack of a second. 
With Governor Maisel dissenting, the Board then approved a 
budget totaling $20.3 million for calendar 1970, the make-up being 
as indicated in the documentation attached under Item No. 10. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
substantial difficulties were encountered.

M E M B E R OF THE BOAR a 
December 20, 1969 
The Honorable John E. Moss, Chairman, 
Foreign Operations and Government 
Information Subcommittee, 
Committee on Government Operations, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C.. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
i 
This is in reply to your letter of November 7, 1969, in 
which you requested the Board to respond to several questions designed 
to reaffirm and clarify the basic rights of the Congress to information 
from its delegate agencies. 
Before replying to the specific questions posed in your 
letter, I should like to say that the Board s position in this matter 
has always been that the Board of Governors, as a statutory body 
ereated by the Congress, is fully responsible to Congress and the 
Board fully recognizes the rights, privileges and duties of Congress 
3.n discharging its Constitutional responsibilities. 
In this regard 
the Board has always endeavored to be fully responsive to requests 
information from Congress and its constituent Committees. 
The following are our answers to the specific questions 
which ycu raised: 
1. "Does your Board claim, under any circumstances, the 
r
ight to withhold facts or information from the Committees of Congress 
having jurisdiction over your agency under the rules of the respective 
Houses or the Reorganization Act of 1946?" 
The Board does not claim the right to withhold facts or 
information from the Committees of Congress having jurisdiction over 
t^e Board under the rules of the respective Houses or the Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1946. However, in discharging its statutory responsibilities 

The Honorable John E. Moss 
-2-
in the areas of monetary policy and bank supervision and regulation, 
the Board obtains a great deal of statistical and other information 
from bantcs and other institutions, some of which is confidential in 
nature. Much of this information is cf a type which such businesses 
would not make public for competitive reasons, and would be reluctant 
to provide to the Board without assurance of its confidential treat-
ment. Occasionally, requests for such information have been received 
from Congressional Committees. Since it is more useful to a Committee 
to have information that can be released, and the purpose for which the 
information ii sought can usually be accomplished through provision of 
information that can be released, we try in these instances to work out 
with the Committee a method of satisfying the request in that manner. 
At times when such an arrangement could not be made, we have furnished 
the information on a confidential basis. 
Similarly, the Board would be reluctant to furnish to 
Congressional Committees documents whose premature release could damage 
this country's international relations or handicap the Federal Reserve 
System in carrying out its statutory responsibilities or redound to 
the special advantage of sophisticated participants in the money markets, 
unless wa could be sure that their contents would not be made public. 
However, we believe that these considerations are understood and respected 
b
>' the Committees concerned. 
2. "If any such claim is made or has been made, describe the 
circumstances of the claimed right and cite the specific authorities upon 
which you rely, including statutes, court decisions, legal opinions, etc." 
Not applicable. 
3. "If the claim is based on statute, is the Congress specif-
ically named as being excluded from having access to information regard-
ing your agency's activities?" 
Not applicable. 
4. "Please state specifically whether your agency recognizes 
right of Congressional Committees in exercising oversight over your 
agency's activities to have access to all facts during the entire course 
consideration of matters pending before your agency." 
The Board does recognize the right of Congressional Committees 
to have access to all facts during the course of the Board's considera-
tion of matters pending before it. The Board would, of course, refrain 
from commenting on the merits of an application pending before it. 
5. "If the answer to Number 4 is in the negative, 
"(a) State the specific conditions which would cause the 
a
gcncy to withhold facts or information from Congress. 

The Honorable John E. Moss 
-3-
%J J D i V 
"(b) Cite specifically and in precise detail the statutes, 
court decisions, legal opinions, etc. on which the agency relies and 
relate them specifically to inquiries by Congressional Committees. 
'(c) Define in detail 'adjudicatory' process if a right 
to withhold is claimed during such process." 
Not applicable. 
6. "Describe in detail the process through which your agency 
makes decisions regarding the availability of information to Congres-
sional Committees." 
Routine requests for information are handled by the Board''s 
staff, often by furnishing the requested information on the telephone. 
Routine mail from Members of Congress is answered by the Chairman of 
the Board, or by another Board member in his absence. Requests for 
c o m m e n t s on legislation and other requests involving policy decisions 
are considered by the Board and answered in a letter signed by the 
Chairman, or by another Board member in his absence. 
7. "Do you or members of your Commission or Board keep 
detailed records qf ex parte contacts formally or informally made during 
the time you c?re considering matters pending before your Board or which, 
in all probability will be pending at an early date? 
Give details." 
We assume that by "ex parte contacts", the Committee means 
contacts made by or on behalf of one party involved in a proceeding 
or other matter pending before the Board. Board members do not enter-
tain such ex parte contacts during the consideration of pending matters. 
In most matters that come before it, t'.ie Board solicits the views of 
the pub lie and any factual issues raised by a member of the public, 
formally or informally, are brought to the attention of the applicant, 
so that i-j may be av/are of all facts in the record which might be adverse 
to its proposal. From time to time, the Board holds hearings or oral 
presentations on matters involving bank supervision and regulation at 
which interested parties may appear following publication of notice of 
such proceeding in the Federal Register. Detailed records of such 
proceedings, generally in the form of a stenographic transcript, are 
kept by the Board. 
8. "Do you regard inquiries from the appropriate Committees 
of Congress exercising their responsibility of oversight as constituting 
'ex parte' contacts?" 
No. 

The Honorable John E. Moss 
-4-
9. "Do you regard your responses concerning access to infor-
mation by the Committees of Congress applicable also to individual Member 
of Congress? 
If not, please explain." 
The Board is fully responsive to requests by individual Members 
of Congress for general information solicited on behalf of their constit-
uents. With respect to confidential information in its possession 
the 
Board would be reluctant to provide an individual Member of Congress 
with such information without assurance that its confidentiality would 
be respected in the same manner as by a Congressional Committee. 
I hope that this information will be useful to the Subcommittee 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) George W. Mitchell

Q D A R D 
December 24, 196$ 
C'ear Sir: 
The sharp further advance in market yields during the fourth 
quarter; the unusually large net savings withdrawals at depositary 
institutions in the October quarterly reinvestment period; and pre-
liminary reports of rather poor savings experience in some areas thus 
f 2 r 
l n
 Uecen:ber hnve all created considerable concern in industry 
circles about the possibility of substantially enlarged savings attri-
tion at such institutions during late December and January. 
In these 
circumstances the Board believes th'at as a matter of general policy 
the Reserve Banks should be prepared-as :.n the summer of 1966-to 
Provide emergency credit facilities 
to nonmember depositary institu-
tions in difficulty as to the adequacy of their liquidity reserves. 
Because the Federal Home Loan Bank System is responsible for 
Providing a lender of last resort accommodation to its members, the 
B
Â°ard believes that it is more efficient for the Home Loan Banks to 
continue exercising full responsibility for providing such assistance 
0 5
 long as their resources permit. There is some possibility, however, 
t h
Â« t the Heme Loan Banks will exhaust their own liquidity in the period 
ahead. 
if this should happen, the FHLBB would have the option of 
c
 rawing on its statutory borrowing line at the Treasury. Hence the 

task of providing an ultimate source oÂ£ liquidity to members of the 
Home Loan Bank System may be viewed as a joint responsibility of the 
F11LBB, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve. 
In order to coordinate possible measures that might be take 
by all three or these agencies in meeting any emergency liquidity 
needs of the savings and loan industry, the Board is currently explor 
ing ways in which Federal Reserve assistance mi^ht be supplied throng 
the Home Lean Banks rather than directly to individual S and L's, As 
soon as appropriate procedures have been developed to achieve this 
Purpose y you will be advised of any ways in which they affect your 
operations. Such procedures would probably not become operative in 
Â°
n
y event, however, until other sources oi liquidity available to the 
Home Loan Bank Sv.item had been substantially usod up. 
In the meantime, Reserve Banks r.eed be prepared to provide 
emergency credit assistance only to mutual savings banks, other banks 
a
nd savings arid loan associations that are members of neither the 
t G r
leral Reserve nor the Federal Home Loan Bank Systems. 
Emergency 
credit to these latter types of institutions should be provided in 
Accordance with the following principles: 
1. Any such institution experiencing a deposit 
drain too large to be handled through internal 
portfolio and other operating adjustments with-
out severe loss unrelated to the quality of assets 
should make the fullest use possible of its 
existing credit lines and other arrangements with 
member commercial banks. The member banks, in 
turn, should be expected to honor their customer 
commitmentsâwith such institutions as well as 

with other customers--without being given special 
treatment at the discount window. The Reserve 
Banks should be prepared to accept, collateral 
pledged by the nonmcmber institutions with member 
banks as security for advances to member banks 
under Section 13 or Section 10(b) of the Federal 
Reserve Act, but the resulting advances to member 
banks should be on short-term notes and subject 
to the usual administration and policy discipline 
of the discount window. 
The Reserve Banks should stand ready to extend 
credit directly to applicable nonmetnber institu-
tions thai: have exhausted their private sources of 
credit in accordance with paragraph 1 above to the 
extent that appropriate collateral'can be provided. 
Such credit assistance would include advances 
directly to such institutions 011 the collateral of 
Government and Federal agency securities under the 
thirteenth paragraph of Section 13 of the Federal 
Reserve Act and also the discount under the third 
paragraph of Section 13 of any eligible paper such 
institutions may have. Extensions of credit under 
eit.he r paragraph should be for periods of 30 days 
or ju;ss, subject to renewal. Utilization of any 
available collateral for such direct assistance 
under these paragraphs shoul.1 precede activation 
of indirect lending arrangements for individual 
institutions as provided in paragraph 3 below. 
In the event that an applicable nonmember 
institution has exhausted both its private credit 
sources and its supply of collateral eligible 
to support direct credit extensions from the Reserve 
Banks, arrangements to extend credit indirectly 
through a member bank or banks should be activated. 
Such arrangements should be initiated only as the 
n:?ed is indicated for individual institutions. 
Federal Reserve credit should be extended to the 
member bank involved in such arrangements on the 
basis of ordinary advances or discounts or through 
Section 10(b) advances. 
In cither event, 
renewable notes of 30 days or less should be 
utilized, and any such "conduit" credit rhould 
be considered as separate from and in addition 

3967 
to the member bank's normal access to discount 
r-r facilities. 
It would be expected that such special 
treatment as to discount policy would provide the 
basis for close Reserve Bank supervision of the 
terms and conditions of any credits extended by 
memb?.r banks under the arrangement. 
In particular, 
it would be desirable that the ra:e charged be no 
more than 2 percentage points above the rate set on 
Section 10(b) advances and uhat the policies and 
practices with respect to repayment requirements 
be comparable to those observed by the Reserve 
Bank in its direct credit extensions to these or 
similar institutions. 
In order to provide for prompt implementation of such a program 
for extensions of emergency credit facilities during the next few weeks, 
the Board haa taken the following actions: 
Effective today and until April 1, 1970: 
(a) member banks are permitted pursuant to Section 19(e) 
of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.3.C. 374) and 
section 2.01.5 of Regulation. A, to use as security 
for advances from your Bank, whether under Section 13 
or Section 10(b) of the Act, assets acquired from 
mutual savings banks, other banks, and savings 
and loan associations, that are members of neither 
the Federal Reserve nor the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Systems, but only in accordance with, and subject 
to the limitations provided in paragraphs 1 and 3 
above; and 
(b) your Bank is authorized, in accordance with the 
third paragraph of Section 13 of -.he Federal 
Reserve Act, in unusual and exigent circumstances 
to disccunt for the same types of nonrr.ember institu-
tions paper of the kinds described in that para-
graph, subject, however, to the limitation therein 
contained and in accordance with, and subject to, 
the limitations contained in paragraph 2 above. 

Wo specific Board action is required for direct advances by 
your Bank to any such nonmember institutions pursuant ro the thirteenth 
Paragraph of Section 13 of the Federal Rererve Act; but any such 
advances should be wade in accordance with paragraph 2 above. 
There is likewise no necessity for any specific Board action 
as a prerequisite to the acceptance by ycisr Bank as security for 
advances to member banks of any assets acquired by the member banks 
Â£rorr, ncnmc-mbr-.r institutions of the types indicated that are not banks 
i o r
 purposes of the Federal Reserve Act, but any such indirect exten-
sions of Federal Reserve credit to such institutions should be made in 
accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 above. 
Since the provisions of the third paragraph of section 13 
the Federal Reserve Act have never heretofore, been utilized, no 
,;
al:e of discount has been established for discounts under that para-
graph. while it seems unlikely that resort to the authority contained 
11
 this paragraph will be necessary under the current program, it is 
Su
8gestc.ci Chat, if such resort should appear inxvtnent, your Lank might 
V/
ish to establish, subject to review and determination by the Board, 
the same discount rate as that now established for direct advances to 
Individualo, partnerships, and corporations other than member banks unde 
the. thirteenth paragraph of section 13. 
It is also suggested that 
this latter rate be established uniformly in all Reserve districts at 
^"1/2 poj: cent. 

w '6 u 
3969 
To keep abreast of any special credit assistance granted in 
accordance with this program, the Board would appreciate receiving, 
as of the close of business each day in which such credit assistance 
is outstanding, a special telegraphic borrowing report containing the 
following information, identified by iten number as noted: 
I, Out standing borrowing by member banks secured by 
collateral received from nonmember institutions 
of the types indicated in the first full paragraph 
on page 2, but subject to usual Regulation A 
restraints (in accordance wiith paragraph 1 above); 
(a) Number of banks '.'orrowing

; 
Total amount outstanding

Outstanding borrowing by such nonmember institutions 
(in accordance with paragraph 2 above):

outside usual Regulation A restraints, for proposes 
of relending to a depositary-type institution (in 
accordance with paragraph 3 above); 
(a) Number of banks borrowing 
(b) Total amount outstanding 
Such telegraphic, reports should bo addressed to Mr. Ring at the 
Board; a coy/ should also be sent to Mr, Weidner, Market Statistics 
Department, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The daily wire should 
ke supplemented by a daily m i l report addressed to Mr, Ring at-'the 
fioard, listing the name of each institution initiating renewing, repaying, 
otherwise changing borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank in the 
banner specified under items I, II, or III above, and the outstanding 
amount of such borrowing by that institution, classified by type of 
collateral.

No general publicity is being given to this program at this 
time. However, it is expected that the Reserve Banks will make 
reasonable effort-, to bring the arrangements for special assistance 
to the attention of those financial institutions that may find 
themselves in need of such special assistance. 
It is important: that the policies and procedures of the 
Federal Reserve B.tnks be reasonably uniform in the event any sizeable 
number of emergency assistance loans are made. For this purpose

Under-present conditions, sophisticated open market opera-
tions enable the System to head off general liquidity crises, but 
such operations are less appropriate when the System is confronted 
vith seriouw financial strains among individual firms or specialized 
groups of institutions. At times such pressures may be inherent in 
the nature of monetary restraint, in the sense that monetary policy 
actions, no matter how impersonally applied, often have, in fact, 
excessively harsh impacts on particular sectors of the economy. At 
Â°ther times underlying economic conditions may change in unforeseen 
^ ' s , to the detriment of a particular financial substructure. 
And, 
Â°t course, the possibility of local calamities or management failure

 Electing individual institutions or small groups of institutions is 
ever-present. 
It is in connection with these limited crises that 
discount winch;*? can play an effective role as "lender of last resort." 
This responsibility is not cons.rued as placing the Federal 
Reserve in the position of maintaining the financial structure in status

ircumstancer., require loans to institutions other than member banks. 
The apparent general approval of recent instances of lending and offering 
to lend tc lvmmembtr institutions has strengthened the belief that the 
System's ability to carry out this function should be readily available 
use when needed. 
In. contrast to the case o:: membar banks, however, 
Justification for Federal Reserve assistance to nonmember institutions 
must be i.n terms of the probable impact of failure on the economy's 
financial structure. 
It would be most unusual for the failure of a 
s i n g l e 
institution or small group of institutions to have such significant 
r e
percussions as to justify Federal Reserve action.â
1
'' 
An exception might be made in a case where the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation requested Federal Reserve assistance for a 
nonmember commercial bank while the FDIC carried out a program 
to remedy the situation. 

*> i

The Federal Reserve Act places no exp-.icit limitations 
on the types or institutions eligible for direct emergency credit 
assistance, since it authorizes direct advances to ''any individual, 
partnership, or corporation.
1
''; but in fact, rather stringent limita-
tions are imposed by the requirement that these advances be secured 
by 'direct obligations of the United States,
rr
 
(and since September 
9 / 
I960 obligations if U, 3. agencies).- 
In effect this means that, 
in an emergency, credit in any significant: amount could probably be 
extended to nonmember> at least nonbank, institutions only by us'i.r.g 
a member bank as a conduit. That is. the Federal Reserve would lend 
funds to cooperating member banks that would in turn make loans to 
nonmember irs titmions. The relevant Federal agency can also sometime 
serve in ths role of a conduit, so long as that agency has lending 
authority and assets eligible for Federal Reserve acquisition. 
Thus 
the current law is not prohibitive of indirect lending to nonbank 
institutions, although it does involve additioral arrangements and 
costs over those >;hat would be involved in direct loans. 
Decisions as to what types of institutions will be regarded, 
under justifiable circumstances, as eligible fcr emergency credit are 
In unusual and exigent circumstances the Board of Governors, by 
the affirmative vote of at least five members, may authorize any 
Federal. Reserve Bank to discount eligible paper for any individual 
partnership, or corporation which is unable to obtain adequate 
credit accommodation from other banking institutions. 
However, 
in practice this provision is of little use, since nonmember 
institutions typically have only very limited holdings of 
eligible paper. 

o ( 
o f fcj - t

best made in the light of the surrounding circumstances and relative 
severity of particular situations. Therefore, no inclusive or 
exclusive list of the types of institutions to -vhich emergency 
credit may b- extended should be established in advance of anticipated 
possible developments. 
Federal Reserve cvedit would be advanced to 
nonmember institutions only after other avenues of relief have been 
exhausted. Depositary institutions, the suppliers and holders of 
the nation's liquidity, are the most likely to encounter situations 
where this in necessary, and for this reason emergency credit would 
b
o accorded, in all but the most extraordinary circumstances, only 
to those institutions. 
Supervised nonmember financial institutions would be 
required to cbrain the support and assent of the relevant super-
visory agency to receive Federal Reserve emergency credit. 
On the. 
other hand, the Federal Reserve should not be obligated to lend to 
nonmembers merely on the reqiest of their supervisor. While institu-
tions can be declared insolvent only by the chartering authority or 
th'--
" courts (and such a declaration would effectively preclude Federal 
Reserve lending), the System should retain the option to reject 
r e
quests for assistance even when the other agency considers the 
institutions solvent. 
When lending to nonmembers, the System will require, in 
c
Â°operation with the relevant supervisory agency, that the institutions 
develop and pursue a workable program for alleviating rheir difficulties 
a
nd vjj.il follow the progress of the agreed-upon program closely. 

Credit v?ill be prcvided only at a significant penalty rate vis-a-vis 
that charged member banks. This penalty rate can be thought of as 
offsetting, in part, the cost of maintaining reserves with the System 
which is continuously borne by member banks.
