revision of the preliminary draft entry for April 19. The entries were 
now presented for approval by the Board. 
After discussion, the entries were approved unanimously. 
It 
was understood that they would be distributed to the Reserve Bank 
Presidents, primarily for information but with an indication of the 
date by which any further comments should be received. 
It was contem-
plated that the April 19 entry would be released to the press about 
July 18 and the April 30 entry about July 29, 1968, following final 
review by the Board. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Sterling balances credit package. At the request of Chairman 
Martin, there was distributed a draft of a paper entitled "Proposal 
for U.S. Participation in Sterling Balances Credit Package" dated 
June 27, 1968, and reading as follows: 
It is proposed that the Treasury, through the ESF, 
participate as principal in the arrangement with the BIS. 
That is, the Treasury would undertake a commitment to make 
3-month renewable dollar/sterling swaps with the BIS for 
the U.S. share (approximately $600 million). As outlined 
in the BIS plan, such swaps could be drawn upon by the 
BIS--to finance draw-downs of sterling balances â€” during a 
three-year period and, after a two-year grace period, 
would be repayable during a five-year period ending 10 
years after the initiation of the scheme. 
When and to the extent that the swap was drawn upon 
by the BIS, the dollars would be made available by the ESF. 
If the resources of the ESF are insufficient to meet these 
and other commitments, the Federal Reserve would be pre-
pared to warehouse for the ESF necessary portions of the 
sterling it acquires as a result of the swap with the BIS.

In view of the principle that the Federal Reserve 
should confine its foreign operations to short-term 
maturities, the Treasury will provide assurance to the 
Federal Reserve of its readiness to take back the ware-
housed sterling within a reasonably short period. 
In 
any event, the Treasury will stand ready, one year after 
each drawing is warehoused, to reacquire it on three 
months notice from the Federal Reserve. 
Chairman Martin stated that at a meeting yesterday at the 
Treasury he had made the point that if the Federal Reserve were to 
participate there would have to be united support for the plan within 
the Government. 
There would have to be no question but that the pro-
posal had been agreed to by everyone concerned. He understood that 
the plan for U.S. participation in a sterling balances credit package 
was to be presented to the President today or Monday. 
If the President 
approved, steps would have to be taken to obtain an authorization from 
the Federal Open Market Committee to permit Federal Reserve participa-
tion since the Treasury did not have sufficient resources in the 
Exchange Stabilization Fund to meet this and other commitments, and it 
could not obtain funds through other channels at this stage to augment 
the Stabilization Fund. 
At the Chairman's request, Mr. Solomon reviewed the resources 
of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, present and prospective, following 
which, at Governor Brimmer's request, he reviewed the nature of the 
Proposed overall sterling balances credit package, including the steps 
that would be followed in drawing upon it. 
Governor Daane returned to the room at this point. 

2488 
6/28/68

Governor Robertson noted that the Open Market Committee would 
have to increase its authorization to acquire warehoused sterling from 
$350 million to roughly $950 million. He went on to say that, cutting 
through the series of contemplated transactions, one might charge that 
this was simply a device to place Federal Reserve funds at the disposal 
of the Treasury to carry out a worthy purpose. The Federal Reserve 
would be in a better position, he thought, if it acquired the sterling 
subject to an understanding that the Treasury would take out the 
Federal Reserve at any time on demand. 
The Chairman then turned to Mr. Hackley, who pointed out that 
the Federal Reserve Banks, under direction of the Open Market Committee, 
have authority to buy foreign currencies in the open market. When the 
foreign currency program was initiated, it was concluded that the 
Stabilization Fund was a part of the open market, and purchases of 
sterling from the Stablization Fund had been made on that basis. 
On 
the face of it, therefore, the proposed transactions would amount to 
open market purchases of sterling, even though from the Stabilization 
Fund, and there was no statutory limitation on the length of time the 
Federal Reserve could hold the sterling. However, he had reservations, 
Perhaps more on policy grounds than on strictly legal grounds. 
Regard-
less of the fact that purchases of sterling under the proposed arrange-
m e n t might be called purchases in the open market from the Stabiliza-
tion Fund, they would amount to lending, through the Treasury, to a 

6/28/68 
- 7 -
foreign central bank. 
He had been concerned since 1962 that what was 
denominated as an open market operation could in effect represent a 
disguised extension of credit for a long period of time to a foreign 
central bank. 
The proposed arrangement might be so regarded, partic-
ularly if there was no specific limit on the time for which the Federal 
Reserve would be required to hold the sterling. 
It would be helpful 
if the Treasury did agree to a proposition, such as contained in the 
last paragraph of the draft proposal, whereby it would stand ready one 
year after each drawing was warehoused to reacquire the sterling on 
three-month notice. 
He also had some reservations about the plan on 
the ground that it might be regarded as indirect financing of the U.S. 
Treasury by the Federal Reserve. Nevertheless, as a strictly legal 
matter, he felt that the plan could be supported. 
After some discussion of possible alternatives, during which 
members of the Board expressed the view that it would be less desirable 
for the Federal Reserve than the Treasury to assume the role of prin-
cipal, Governor Robertson said he could fully understand that the 
Treasury would want to participate, on behalf of the U.S., in an 
undertaking so important to the whole international financial commu-
nity, and that the Federal Reserve would want to assist the Treasury. 
In his view, however, transactions of this kind should be carried on 
government-to-government, and not by the central bank. 
He asked 
whether there had been full exploration of possibilities whereby the 
Federal Reserve would be taken out at the earliest possible time. 
If 

2490 
6/28/68 
-8-
there were some assurance, for example, that the Treasury would approach 
the Congress as soon as feasible to obtain funds with which to augment 
the Stabilization Fund, he would not be so concerned. 
Governor Maisel inquired whether the terms of the credit pack-
age would be such that a new Administration could decide to withdraw 
U.S. participation, and Mr. Solomon replied that it was his impression 
that the participants would be expected to commit themselves for 10 
years. Chairman Martin also said that he thought there was expected 
to be a clear commitment, with little or no provision for opting out. 
Chairman Martin then observed that Governor Robertson would 
be attending the BIS meeting at Basle next week at which the proposed 
credit would be discussed and that it might be necessary to act fairly 
quickly if the other countries were prepared to move forward. 
Gover-
nor Robertson would have to be in a position to know whether the 
Federal Reserve was willing to go ahead. If the President approved 
the proposal today or tomorrow, contact should be made with members 
of the Open Market Committee to obtain some consensus on what Governor 
Robertson would be able to say at Basle. 
Governor Brimmer stated that he was satisfied that the Treasury 
had to act as principal and assume the long-term commitment. 
This also 
implied a commitment by the Federal Reserve, but he felt that the 
Federal Reserve should press for the right to be taken out within a 
period of less than one year. He was hopeful that the Treasury would 
agree. 

2491 
6/28/68

Governor Daane said that in discussions the position had been 
taken that it was important for the Federal Reserve to have a take-out 
from the Treasury and that the central bank should not enter into an 
agreement that would amount to signing up for a 10-year loan. 
There followed further discussion as to the possibility of 
cutting down the total period of 15 months envisaged in the last 
paragraph of the draft proposal, and Mr. Reynolds pointed out that 
it was hard for the Treasury to say when it could obtain the necessary 
funds. 
It would have to get them either through consent of the Con-
gress or as a result of activation of the special drawing rights 
mechanism. 
It would be difficult to ask the Treasury to draw on the 
International Monetary Fund for the purpose of repaying the Federal 
Reserve. 
Governor Brimmer commented that the Treasury should realize 
the magnitude of the claims to which it might be subjected by reason 
of U.S. participation in the credit package, and it should put itself 
in a position to meet such claims. The Federal Reserve apparently 
would have to serve as a backstop, but he doubted whether the Treasury 
should have as long as 15 months before it had to make arrangements to 
relieve the central bank. 
Governor Robertson suggested that it would be desirable if the 
language of the proposal could be worded in such a way as simply to 
agree to assist the Treasury to the extent necessary for the period 

6/28/68 
-10-
inimediately ahead, thus providing the Treasury time to work out other 
means of financing. He recognized that it might not be possible to 
negotiate such an agreement with the Treasury. 
After additional d iscussion Governor Daane said it appeared 
that the Board members present were in agreement that the Federal 
Reserve should accept the idea of short-term warehousing of sterling 
to the extent the Treasury's situation made that necessary. 
The main 
issue seemed to be how long the Federal Reserve should agree to retain 
warehoused sterling. He would like to see the period as short as 
possible. However, the discussions thus far had not indicated that the 
Treasury would be prepared to accept less than the draft proposal. 
Governor Robertson noted that it was clear that the Treasury 
would need backstopping for a year, perhaps 15 months, after the date 
of the agreement. Thereafter, it would seem that a total period of 
nine months should be adequate for the Treasury to make arrangements 
to provide financing through sources other than the Federal Reserve. 
Governor Brimmer expressed agreement. 
Mr. Reynolds noted that the Treasury might point out that a 
maximum of one year had been established for repaying drawings under 
the Federal Reserve swap agreements with foreign central banks, and 
Governors Robertson and Brimmer then indicated that they would be 
willing to go up to 12 months if necessary. Governor Brimmer empha-
sized that his principal concern was to make certain that the Treasury 

9 1' 
6/28/68 
-11-
accepted its obligation as principal and made financial arrangements 
consistent with the assuming of that obligation. 
Governor Daane said he subscribed to the views expressed by 
Governors Robertson and Brimmer. If such language could be worked 
into the proposal, that would be fine. It was crucial, in any event, 
for the Treasury to state that it stood ready to reacquire the sterling 
on notice from the Federal Reserve. 
Governor Maisel commented that after the first of the year 
the Treasury would have to face up to the question of whether to 
approach the Congress for funds. 
Chairman Martin brought out that Governor Robertson might find 
at Basle that the other countries were not ready to go ahead. He then 
noted that at least six members of the Board would be available on 
Monday and that certain Reserve Bank Presidents also would be in the 
Board's offices. He suggested further discussion at that time after 
members of the Board had had an opportunity to consider the matter 
over the weekend. 
In the meantime, efforts could be made to determine 
the possibility of negotiating a change in the language of the proposal 
along lines that had been suggested today. 
The meeting then adjourned.
