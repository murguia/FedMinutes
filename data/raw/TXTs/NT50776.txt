Item No. 1 
6/1/71 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
THE CENTRAL BANCORPORATION, INC., 
Cincinnati, Ohio, 
for approval of acquisition of 100 per 
cent of the voting shares (less 
directors' qualifying shares) of the 
successor by merger to The First Trust 
and Savings Bank, Zanesville, Ohio. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant 
to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve 
Regulation Y (12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by The Central 
Bancorporation, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio ("Applicant"), a registered 
bank holding company, for the Board's prior approval of the acqui-
sition of 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' qualify-
ing shares) of the successor by merger to The First Trust and Savings 
Bank, Zanesville, Ohio ("Bank"). The new bank has significance only 
a s a means of acquiring all of the shares of the bank to be merged 

1380 
-2-
into it; the proposal is therefore treated herein as one to acquire 
shares of The First Trust and Savings Bank, 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
written notice of receipt of the application to the Superintendent of 
Banks of the State of Ohio and requested his views and recommendation. 
The Superintendent recommended approval of the application. 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on April 15, 1971 (36 Federal Register 7160), pro-
viding an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments and 
views with respect to the proposed transaction. A copy of the appli-
cation was forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for 
its consideration. Time for filing comments and views has expired 
and all those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of the 
factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the effect of 
the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of Applicant and the banks concerned, 
and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Upon 
such consideration the Board finds that: 
Applicant, the ninth largest banking organization in Ohio, 
controls two banks with deposits of approximately $501 million, repre-
senting less than 3 per cent of total commercial bank deposits in the 
State. (All banking data are as of June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect 
holding company formations and acquisitions approved by the Board 

1381 
-3-
through April 30, 1971.) The acquisition of Bank, with deposits of 
$24 million, would increase Applicant's control of deposits in the 
State by only 0.1 per cent, and its present ranking among banking 
organizations in the State would not change. 
Bank has five offices and is the smallest of three banks 
located in Muskingum County, all of which are headquartered in Zanesville. 
The two larger banks control approximately 43 and 30 per cent of 
county deposits, respectively, and Bank controls 27 per cent of such 
deposits. Applicant's subsidiary nearest to Bank is located in Marietta, 
60 miles southeast of Zanesville, and the nearest offices of the two 
banks are separated by one county and five banking offices. It appears 
that there is no significant present competition between Applicant's 
subsidiaries and Bank; that consummation of the proposal could serve 
to stimulate additional competition in the Zanesville area by severing 
a present relationship between Bank and the largest bank in Zanesville. 
It further appears that the proposed acquisition would not foreclose 
significant potential competition because of Ohio's restrictive branch-
ing laws and of the distances involved; nor does it appear that any 
competing banks would be adversely affected by the proposed acquisition. 
Based upon the record, the Board concludes that consummation of the 
proposed acquisition would have no significant adverse effect on 
competition in any relevant area. 

-3-
1382 
The banking factors and convenience and needs considerations 
involved in this proposal are consistent with and lend some weight in 
favor of approval of the application. Affiliation with Applicant would 
enhance Bank's prospects, and permit Bank to improve and enlarge present 
services in its trust department, and in its installment and mortgage 
lending. In addition, Applicant would assist Bank in researching the 
feasibility of establishing other branches in northern Muskingum County 
which is apparently in need of additional banking facilities. It is the 
Board's judgment that the proposed transaction would be in the public 
interest, and that the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered, For the reasons set forth in the findings 
summarized above, that said application be and hereby is approved, pro-
vided that the action so approved shall not be consummated (a) before 
the thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order, or (b) later 
than three months after the date of this Order, unless such period is 
extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland pursuant to delegated authority. 
By order of the Board of Governors, June 1, 1971. 
Voting for this action: Vice Chairman Robertson and 
Governors Mitchell, Maisel, Brimmer, and Sherrill. 
Absent and not voting: Chairman Burns and Governor Daane.

The Honorable Abraham. A. Ribicoff, 
Chairman 
Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization and 
Government Research 
Committee on Government Operations 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 
20510 
Dear Mr. 
Chairman: 
I am writing in response to your request for a report f r o m 
the Board on S. 867, S. 1177, and S. 1205, all of which would provide 
for the establishment of one or m o r e new agencies to represent 
consumers and coordinate consumer affairs for the federal govern-
ment. 
One matter the bills do not include, and which we recommend 
be included, is the transfer to any new consumer agency of some of the 
existing consumer protection functions now lodged in various depart-
ments and agencies of the government. 
Among the functions that 
logically should be transferred to such an agency are those assigned 
to the Board under section .105 of Public Law 90-321, which requires 
the Board to p r e s c r i b e regulations for the implementation of the 
Truth in Lending Act. 
The responsibility of prescribing such 
regulations should be vested in an agency that devotes full time to 
consumer affairs. 
Furthermore, transfer of this rule-making 
function to the new agency would be m o r e consistent with the Board 
of Governors primary responsibilities in the field of monetary policy. 
There arc provisions in m o r e or less the same f o r m in 
each of the bills that would authorize the new office, agency, or 
bureau to obtain information f r o m other federal agencies upon 
request, unless compliance with such a request would conflict 
with other statutes. 
We anticipate that there would be little 

The Honorable Abraham A. Ribicoff 
- 2 - 1 3 8 5 
o c c a s i o n for e x e r c i s e of this authority with respect to matters under 
the B o a r d ' s jurisdiction, particularly if Congress accepts our 
recommendation to transfer the function of prescribing Truth in 
Lending regulations. 
In any event, the provisions r e c o g n i z e that 
such requests are to be consistent with responsibilities vested by 
statute in the agencies to which the requests are addressed. 
While we hope favorable consideration will be given to 
the B o a r d ' s suggestion, we favor the enactment of legislation along 
the general lines of the three bills b e f o r e your subcommittee. 
Sincerely, 

1386

Mr. C. William F i s c h e r 
Assistant Director for 
Legislative R e f e r e n c e 
Office of Management and Budget 
Washington, D. C.

Dea.r M r . 
F i s c h e r : 
I am writing in response to your request of May 27 for the 
B o a r d ' s views on a draft bill relating to interlocks between financial 
institutions and other companies, and to ownership of c o m m e r c i a l 
bank shares by mutual savings banks. 
The Board believes that the proposed draft is too broad in 
scope and grants too much discretion to supervisory agencies. 
The draft authorizes the supervisory agencies to prohibit 
all interlocks among depositary institutions. 
While it is m o s t unlikely 
that the agencies would go that far, such a broad grant of authority 
seems unnecessary and unwise, when for a number of years the 
Clayton Act has incorporated an objective 
standard--geographic 
p r o x i m i t y - - t h a t has worked reasonably well as a rule-of-thumb to 
identify situations where interlocks would be anticompetitive. 
The 
Board believes that it is better to retain such an objective standard 
in the statute, with modifications such as a size test to prohibit 
interlocks among institutions that do business nationwide. 
M o r e o v e r , the draft would grant similarly broad authority 
to prohibit interlocks between financial institutions and. "non-depositary 
institutions, " such as insurance companies and sales finance companies, 
and interlocks between financial institutions and companies with which 
they do business. 
If, as the Board believes, a blanket prohibition of all 

M r . C. William F i s c h e r 
1387 
such interlocks would be gravely disruptive, the Congress should 
not be asked to grant administrative agencies such power, nor should 
administrative agencies be asked to accept responsibility f o r its use 
without: statutory standards indicating how it is to be used. 
The difficulties would be compounded by dispersing such 
authority among five different agencies. 
For these reasons, the Board favors a different approach, 
in line with Chairman Burns' testimony, and a proposed draft has 
been submitted in response to a Congressional request made when he 
appeared b e f o r e the House Committee on Banking and Currency. 
A 
copy of this draft is enclosed. 
The Board does not favor the prohibitions in the proposed 
draft against ownership of bank stock by savings banks. 
The draft 
would i m p o s e much m o r e stringent requirements, including divestiture, 
on mutual savings banks that own c o m m e r c i a l banks than Congress has 
i m p o s e d on other bank holding companies in the Bank Holding Company 
Act, as recently amended. 
In view of the standards established under 
that A c t to guard against possible anticompetitive effects of bank 
holding company operations generally, the Board seesno need to 
establish stricter rules for this special class of holding companies. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon
