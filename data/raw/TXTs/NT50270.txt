Several questions were raised, however, reflecting a sense of 
concern felt by some Board members with respect to the effect of operations 
being conducted by American banks through limited-service branches in 
Nassau. It was understood that the staff would review the situation,

particularly against the background of the objectives of the foreign 
> • 
credit restraint program, and report to the Board. 
Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed acquisition of assets and assumption 
of deposit liabilities of The Independent Bank, Anaheim, California, 
by Barclays Bank of California, San Francisco, California, a subsidiary 
of Barclays Bank Limited, London, England, a registered bank holding 
company, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. The conclusion read as follows: 
There is virtually no present competition and only 
a modest potential for competition between Barclays 
Bank of California, San Francisco, California, and 
The Independent Bank, Anaheim, California. The overall 
effect of the proposed transaction on competition would 
be slightly adverse. 
Multiple maturity time deposits. At its meeting on April 17, 
1968, the Board had considered the propriety of proposals presented 
through a member bank that would have permitted the withdrawal of funds 
on various dates from a time deposit that required 90 days' written 
notice of withdrawal. 
It had been suggested at that time that the 
ruling be made the basis of a more general published interpretation 
with respect to multiple maturity time deposits in view of the numerous 
questions that had arisen. A memorandum from the Legal Division dated 
May 13, 1968, submitted a draft of such a statement. 
Members of the Board expressed the view that the proposed 
interpretation, couched in technical terms, would be understandable

to only a comparatively few parties. As explained by the staff, one 
principal purpose of the statement would be to provide a guide for banks 
in the formulation of programs. However, Board members suggested that 
a modification of the approach to include specifics and sort out the 
problem areas would make the statement more understandable and accomplish 
not only the staff's purpose but a broader objective also. 
Accordingly, it was understood that a revised statement would be 
prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Federal Advisory Council. Unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to the Secretary of the Federal Advisory Council transmitting 
topics suggested for discussion at the forthcoming meeting of the Council. 
A copy is attached as Item No. 2. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Appointment

household effects from Grinnell, Iowa, to Washington and return

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to Union Bank, Los Angeles, California, pursuant to the 
provisions of Sections 9 and 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, to estab-
lish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, and to operate and maintain such 
branch subject to the provisions of such Sections and of Regulation M. 
The foregoing permission is granted subject to any necessary approval 
of the California State Banking Department. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before June 1, 1969, all rights granted hereby shall 
be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted will 
automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, when the branch is opened for business, 
furnishing information as to the exact location of the branch. 
The 
Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in loca-
tion of the branch in Nassau. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, funds 
provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated capital, ad-
vances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign assets for purposes 
°f the foreign credit restraint effort. In view of the Board's con-
cern with minimizing the impact of foreign investments on the balance 
°f payments, the above consent is given with the understanding that 
m the conduct of the branch's operations maximum reliance will be 
placed on resources obtained outside the United States. 
Accordingly, 
l t : is understood that any investment required will be made within the 
guidelines established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in 
effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities 
your bank, and that due consideration is being given to the priori-
ties contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P . Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Board of Directors, 
United California Bank, 
Los Angeles, California. 
Gentlemen: 
The Acting Director of the Division of Examinations, on 
behalf of the Board of Governors under delegated authority, approves 
-the establishment of a branch by United California Bank, Los Angeles, 
California, at the southwest corner of La Cienega Boulevard and 18th 
Street, Los Angeles, California, provided the branch is established 
within one year from the date of this letter. 
In approving this application, it has been determined that 
your management is adequate, that the proposed branch will serve the 
convenience and needs of the community, and that establishment of the 
ranch will not tend to create an undesirable competitive situation. 
It is noted that Vice President Jennings of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a letter dated March 1, 1968, 
transmitting the most recent report of examination to your bank, 
commented upon the need for strengthening your bank's liquidity 
and capital positions. These matters deserve your close attention. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L . Carmichael 
Elizabeth L. Carmichael, 
Assistant Secretary.
