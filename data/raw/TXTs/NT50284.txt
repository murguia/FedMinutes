Indebtedness reports. Pursuant to the understanding at the 
Board meeting on April 25, 1967, the question of a general System 
Policy with respect to submission of reports on outside activities 
and certain financial transactions by Reserve Bank officers and 
employees was referred to the Presidents' Conference for review and 
recommendations.

There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 6, 1968, 
from the Division of Examinations relating to the recommendations on 
the so-called "indebtedness" reports that had been adopted by the Con-
ference of Presidents on the basis of a study made by the Subcommittee 
on Personnel. The recommendations were as follows: 
That indebtedness reports be required to be submitted 
by all officers and all employees in supervisory positions 
or in sensitive jobs regardless of grade. 
That each Federal Reserve Bank, in its discretion, 
require the submission of indebtedness reports by other 
employees or require other forms of reporting from employees 
or categories of employees where it appears that such other 
reporting requirements are warranted by special circumstances. 
That the scope of the indebtedness report be limited to 
questions concerning: outside employment and outside busi-
ness affiliations; ownership of stock of banks or affiliates 
of banks; borrowings from member banks; and other personal 
indebtedness, including liability as endorser or guarantor. 
That each Federal Reserve Bank, in its discretion, 
exempt from the reporting requirement: indebtedness for 
ordinary and current bills; and borrowings from insurance 
companies against cash value of life insurance. 
The memorandum commented on certain areas in which the Divi-
sion of Examinations recommended that the Board seek further clarifi-
cation. One point related to a definition of "sensitive" as applied 
C o jobs covered by 
reporting requirements. Over the years the Reserve 
Banks generally had regarded as security-sensitive the positions of 
employees working in areas where money and other valuables were exposed. 
However, there was a lack of uniformity among the Reserve Banks as to 
the categories of employees who would be required to submit reports 

o-ry 
tJtJ 
6/12/68

relating to financial transactions and outside activities. Another 
point related to the conclusion that the standard reporting format 
should not include provision for information on political affiliations 
or speculative dealings. It was left to the discretion of the Reserve 
Bank to determine whether to obtain information on political activi-
ties, and which categories of employees should be requested to furnish 
information on speculative dealings. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it would not be 
appropriate to inquire into the political affiliations of employees, 
and he wondered why the form was called an indebtedness report since 
it related to a variety of matters. Otherwise, he agreed with the 
approach suggested by the Division of Examinations. 
Governor Sherrill felt that the recommendations were a step 
in the right direction. It seemed to him that, if anything, they did 
nÂ°t go far enough. A review of the debts of lower-level employees 
should not be relied upon to prevent defalcations; rather dependence 
should be placed upon auditing and internal control procedures. On 
the other hand, reports from high-level employees were important from 
the standpoint of discovering conflicts of interest. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that a letter along the 
lines of a draft that had been distributed to the Board would be gen-
erally appropriate. Determination of the details of a general policy 
Would be deferred pending reconsideration of the recommendations by 

.O/CU* 
6/12/68

the Conference of Presidents. Governor Mitchell said he would go 
along with the Division recommendation. 
Unanimous approval was then given to a letter to the Chairman 
(President Ellis) of the Presidents1 Conference in the form attached 
a s Item No. 1. In view of the impending resignation of President 
Ellis, it was understood that a copy of the letter would be sent to 
President Clay, Vice Chairman of the Conference. 
Over-the-counter securities (Item No. 2). At the meeting on 
June 7, 1968, it was agreed to seek expeditious handling through the 
appropriate Congressional committees of legislation that would extend 
the coverage of margin requirements to credit granted by banks and 
other lenders for the purpose of purchasing and carrying over-the-
counter securities. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 11, 
1968, from the Office of the Secretary submitting a draft of letter 
to the Chairman of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee 
that would request an early opportunity for the Board to testify before 
that Committee on H.R. 7696, a bill to extend authority for the imposi-
tion of margin requirements to over-the-counter securities. The memo-
randum noted that a similar request to the Senate Banking and Currency 
Committee was now unnecessary since that Committee had, on June 11, 
favorably reported S. 1299, which would give the Board such authority. 
Mr. Cardon suggested certain changes, largely editorial in 
Mature, that would alter somewhat the tone of the proposed letter.

Unanimous approval was then given to the sending of a letter 
to Chairman Staggers in the form attached as Item No. 2. 
Licensing of Edge corporations to trade in gold (Items 3 and 4). 
American International Bank, New York, New York, an Edge corporation, 
had raised the question whether it would be permissible under sec-
tion 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act for that bank to obtain a license 
from the Treasury Department to purchase, import, and sell gold bullion 
to authorized industrial, professional, and artistic users in the 
United States. At the meetings on May 21 and again on June 10, 1968, 
the staff was instructed to consider the question further in the light 
of the communique relating to gold that was issued on March 17, 1968, 
following the central bank meeting in Washington. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 6, 1968, 
from the Legal Division which pointed out that Edge corporations were 
specifically authorized, under such rules and regulations as the Board 
wight prescribe, to purchase and sell coin, bullion, and exchange. It 
was the conclusion of the Division that operations of the type envis-
aged by American International Bank would clearly be legally permissi-
ble for a corporation organized under section 25(a). However, further 
consideration of the question in the light of the two-tier gold system 
inaugurated March 17 led the Legal Division to agree that there might 
be policy reasons why it would be undesirable for U.S. banks, including 
Edge corporations, to act as Treasury licensees. The Division 
> 

> i i 
6/12/68 
-6-
recommended that the Board authorize discussion with the Treasury of 
licensing regulations and procedures. 
There had also been distributed a memorandum dated June 11, 
1968, from Mr. Sammons that emphasized the need for distinction between 
commodity gold and monetary gold. It was the view of the Division of 
International Finance that licenses to banks to deal in gold should be 
terminated at the earliest possible date. Attached to the memorandum 
was a proposed letter to the Secretary of the Treasury that would 
express reservations about the propriety of granting gold trading 
licenses to commercial banks and Edge corporations in view of the 
March 17 communique. It would suggest that existing licenses granted 
to commercial banks not be renewed when they expired and that no new 
lie enses be issued to commercial banks or Edge corporations. 
Mr. Reynolds stated that in conversation this morning a member 
of the Treasury staff appeared sympathetic to the reasoning advanced 
for the removal of banks from the picture as licensees. However, the 
staff member pointed out that there would be practical problems in 
developing alternatives. He would not object to exploring possibili-
ties of phasing the banks out, but he thought it would be a mistake 
to take such action immediately. 
Mr. Shay then proposed certain changes in the draft of letter 
to the Secretary of the Treasury that would shift the emphasis away 
from the legal basis for Treasury action to the policy question raised 

6/12/68 
-7-
by the March 17 communique. Mr. Shay also pointed out that the letter 
did not make clear what course the Board would follow with respect to 
other Edge corporations that might subsequently make inquiry. 
Following a rather lengthy discussion of various provisions of 
law relating to the powers of national banks and Edge corporations, 
Governor Mitchell suggested that the proposed letter to the Treasury 
be amended so that the tone would be one of prospective action rather 
than immediate urgency. An indication by the Board of an awareness 
of the practical problems that would have to be resolved would, he 
thought, make for a more persuasive presentation. Governor Brimmer 
suggested persuasion through conversations to the extent possible, 
with reliance on the letter principally as a means of focusing on 
the problem. 
Governor Robertson noted that the Board was not really dealing 
with a legal problem and that the attempt therefore must be to persuade 
the Treasury to change its policy on the basis of inconsistency with 
the March 17 agreement. He suggested certain language changes in the 
draft letter. 
It being understood that the changes agreed upon during the 
discussion would be incorporated, unanimous approval was then given 
to the transmittal of a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury in the 
form attached as Item No. 3, along with a letter to American Inter-
national Bank in the form attached as Item No. 4.

Agency issues. Governor Robertson referred to the bill pend-
ing in the Congress that would extend for an additional year the pro-
visions of Public Law 89-597, providing authority for coordinated 
regulation of the maximum rates payable by Federally-insured financial 
institutions. The bill would continue to authorize the Federal Reserve 
Banks to buy and sell in the open market obligations of any Federal 
agency. When the bill was under consideration in the Senate, at Com-
mittee level, an amendment was proposed that would, in addition, 
authorize such purchases directly from the agencies. It would also 
express the sense of Congress that the broadened authority should be 
used "when alternative means cannot effectively be employed, to permit 
financial institutions to continue to supply reasonable amounts of 
funds to the mortgage market during periods of monetary stringency 
and rapidly rising interest rates." 
Governor Robertson noted that hearings were to be held shortly 
before the House Banking and Currency Committee on the proposed legis-
lat ion and asked for comments that might be taken into consideration 
in developing Board testimony, particularly with regard to the sense 
Â°f Congress provision. 
Board members expressed themselves on the seriousness with 
which they would regard the proposed amendment, and there followed a 
lengthy discussion of the proposal from the standpoint of envisaged 
ef fee ts on System open market operations. Governor Robertson then 

6/12/68 
-9-
suggested that testimony be drafted that would oppose the amendment 
on every conceivable ground, including technical grounds. He outlined 
several arguments that he believed might be developed effectively. 
Some Board members remarked that testimony geared to the funda-
mental policy issues might be received with greater interest by the 
Congress than testimony oriented toward technical aspects of the pro-
posal, and Mr. Cardon observed that this depended somewhat on the way 
in which "technical aspects" were defined. It was also suggested that 
if the objective of the proponents would not in fact be met by the 
proposed amendment, the Board should indicate what it believed the 
effects of the proposal would be. Going one step further, the Board 
might suggest preferable alternatives for accomplishing the desired 
objective. 
It was understood that testimony would be drafted in the light 
of these comments and distributed to the Board for consideration. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: A letter was sent 
today to First National City Bank, New 
York, New York, acknowledging receipt 
of notice of its intent to establish an 
additional branch in Peru, to be located 
in Lima. 
On June 12, 1968, action was taken on 
behalf of the Board under delegated 
authority as indicated by the follow-
ing letter, a copy of which is attached

AIR MAIL 
Mr. George H. Ellis, Chairman, 
Conference of Presidents of the 
Federal Reserve Banks, 
c/o Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 
Boston, Massachusetts. 02106. 
Dear Mr. Ellis: 
The Board has noted with appreciation the action taken by 
the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to the Board's letter of 
May 1, 1967, in causing a review to be made by the Subcommittee on 
Personnel of policies pertaining to informational reporting by 
certain categories of employees in the Reserve Banks with respect 
to their outside business activities and financial affairs. To 
confirm the Board's understanding of the recommendations of the 
Subcommittee on Personnel as amended and approved by the Presidents 
a t their meeting on December 11, 1967, the recommendations are set 
forth below: 
A. That indebtedness reports be required to be 
submitted by all officers and all employees 
in supervisory positions or in sensitive 
jobs regardless of grade. The term "indebt-
edness reports" is employed to refer to the 
report relating to outside activities and 
certain financial transactions of Federal 
Reserve Bank personnel which was the subject 
of the Board's May 1, 1967 letter to Chairman 
Swan. 
B. That each Federal Reserve Bank, in its discretion, 
require the submission of indebtedness reports 
by other employees or require other forms of 
reporting from employees or categories of 
employees where it appears that such other 
reporting requirements are warranted by special 
circumstances. 
iiuiyV 
low A -

221' 
Mr. George H. Ellis 
C. That the scope of the indebtedness report be 
limited to the questions concerning: 
1. Outside employment and outside 
business affiliations. 
2. Ownership of stock of banks or 
affiliates of banks. 
3. Borrowings from member banks. 
4. Other personal indebtedness, in-
cluding liability as endorser 
or guarantor. 
D. That each Federal Reserve Bank, in its discretion, 
exempt from the reporting requirement: 
1. Indebtedness for ordinary and current 
bills. 
2. Borrowings from insurance companies 
against cash value of life insurance. 
It will be recalled that reports of the kind described have 
been obtained 
on an annual basis over a considerable period of years 
and most recently have been reflective of the principles expressed in 
the Board's letter of February 10, 1964 (FRLS 9054). As indicated in 
that letter and earlier pronouncements on the subject, these informa-
tional reports were to be submitted by "officers and employees 
occupying responsible positions." In recent years, the policies in 
effect at the respective Reserve Banks were fairly uniform in that 
they were obtained as a minimum from all officers, all members of the 
staffs of the bank examination and auditing departments, all employees 
whose positions required the handling of cash or securities, and other 
employees in responsible positions as determined by grade classification 
other criteria. 
The Board's letter of May 1, 1967 was prompted by questions 
raised by one or two Reserve Banks whether there was need for requesting 
the reports from all employees handling valuables, particularly in the 
lowest grades. The inclusion of such employees in the reporting 
requirement was principally predicated on security considerations: The 

Mr. George H. Ellis 
-3-
information received through the reports was viewed as being of 
assistance in assuring that employees whose duties involved the 
handling or custody of cash and other valuables not engage in out-
side activities of a character that might be incompatible with their 
Reserve Bank employment, or that they not engage in speculative 
transactions or accumulate a heavy burden of debt that might possibly 
lead to breaches of trust on their part. (It is of interest in this 
connection that the case histories of embezzlements by commercial 
ank employees include many instances in which the employees who 
committed these acts were under financial pressures, and that the 
relatively few peculations by Reserve Bank personnel have generally 
involved employees in the lower grades.) 
The Reserve Banks referred to were doubtful that the reports 
Provided any material security benefit, and were of the view that the 
application of the reporting requirement to this large segment of the 
Payroll would invite invasion-of-privacy criticism. The Board noted 
at the Subcommittee on Personnel apparently was not apprehensive on 
e invasion-of-privacy issue, and attached little importance to the 
security value of the information. 
Presumably as a result of differences in views among the 
eserve Bank presidents as to whether and to what extent employees 
andling valuables should be included in the reporting requirement, 
^commendation A leaves it to the discretion of the individual Reserve 
toh 
t 0 d e t e r m i n e w h a t a r e "sensitive jobs." Since the objectives 
BÂ° 
accomplished through the subject reports are the same for all 
nks, the Board feels that substantial variances in the policies 
ursued by the respective Banks would be unfortunate. Accordingly, 
b
 e Â®Â°ard would appreciate the reconsideration of Recommendation A 
job" 6 C o n f e r e n c e o f Presidents with a view to defining "sensitive 
th S 
a<" l e a s t t o t h e extent of specifying those positions which all 
e Reserve Banks would view as sensitive. 
C q 
# 
The Board would also appreciate the Presidents' further 
ti Â®^dÂ®ration of the omission from Recommendation C of topics on 
co 
I t i c a l activities" and "speculative dealings in securities and 
Wo 
t^ e s*" Although information on these two topics apparently 
ti0n ^e elicited through separate reporting as provided in Recommenda-
t 
appears that such separate reporting would add unnecessarily 
sele m!"n:i"strat:i-ve work; also, the justification for setting up a more 
to ? C t^ v e list of employees who would be requested to report on these 
Pics seems unclear.

The Board regrets imposing further on the Conference of

that has gone into the study already it is useful to pursue these 
additional questions now in the hope that a reopening of the general 
subject any time soon may be avoided.

Dear Mr. Chairman: 
In the course of reaching its decision to raise margin 
requirements on listed securities on June 7, 1968, the Board of 
Governors also viewed with concern recent developments with respect 
t o equity securities traded over the counter which the Board has no 
Authority to subject to its margin regulations. All of the available 
indicators of over-the-counter securities market performance appear 
to suggest substantial speculative activity, partly credit-financed, 
which reemphasizes the need for appropriate legislative action in 
this area. 
As you will recall, the Board has recommended to the 
Congress and you have introduced, a bill (H.R. 7696) to permit 
position of margin requirements, to the extent appropriate, on 
Credit granted by banks and other lenders for the purpose of purchas-
e s and carrying the more widely held and actively traded over-the-
counter securities. Enactment of such legislation is needed to close 
a serious gap in the effectiveness of the Board's regulations in 
Preventing excessive use of credit in the securities markets. The 
BÂ°ard believes that current developments in those markets serve to 
E n f o r c e the need for early legislative attention to this problem, 
^he Board hopes for an early opportunity to testify before your 
Committee on the desirability of such legislation. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

June 14, 1968 
The Honorable Henry H. Fowler, 
Secretary of the Treasury, 
U. S. Treasury Department, 
Washington, D. C. 
20220. 
Dear Mr. Secretary: 
The Board has been asked by a corporation organized under 
the Edge Act (section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act) whether it 
would be consistent with that Act for the corporation to be licensed 
by the Treasury to purchase, import, and sell gold to authorized 
industrial, professional, and artistic users in this country. It is 
understood that licenses for this purpose have been issued to national 
and State banks under the regulations of the Treasury Department. 
The Edge Act contains an authorization to deal in bullion 
similar to that applicable to national banks, and the Board would be 
reluctant to raise objections to Edge Act corporations dealing in 
gold pursuant to Treasury licenses on the same basis as national or 
other commercial banks. The Board, however, has serious reservations 
as to the advisability of granting gold trading licenses either to 
commercial banks or Edge Act corporations in view of the policies 
enunciated in the central bankers' communique of March 17. 
The objective of the March 17 communique is to separate 
clearly commodity gold from monetary gold and to prevent the move-
ment of gold stocks from private to official holdings and vice versa. 
The success of this policy depends in large part on the Government's 
ability to persuade the public that this dichotomy does, in fact, 
e*ist and will be preserved. The Board realizes that it was in the 
Public interest to establish a smoothly functioning gold market in 
tbe United States as quickly as possible after March 17. That com-
mercial banks could aid in making a market in gold was, of course, 
recognized by the licensing procedure followed by the Treasury. 
However, it appears to the Board that licensing of commercial banks 
t 0 d eal in gold is tantamount to admitting that privately-held gold 
i s a monetary asset rather than merely a commodity, a view which, 
Â°f course, militates against the objectives of the new policy. 

Honorable Henry H. Fowler 
-2-
J 
The Board suggests, therefore, that the Treasury 
Department reconsider this matter with a view toward removing 
commercial banks and Edge Act corporations from the category of 
licensees as soon as feasible, and that new licenses not be 
issued to additional banks and Edge Act corporations.

Gentlemen: 
This refers to your letter of May 10, 1968 to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York requesting a determination by the Board of 
Governors whether it would be permissible under section 25(a) of the 
ederal Reserve Act for your Bank to obtain a license from the 
Treasury Department to purchase, import, and sell gold bullion to 
authorized industrial, professional, and artistic users in the United 
States. 
â 
Section 25(a) specifically authorizes Edge corporations 
to purchase and sell coin, bullion, and exchange". The exercise of 
h e authority is, of course, subject to applicable governmental 
restrictions. 
. 
# 
Your letter states that "the intended gold activities of 
will consist solely of international transactions, i.e., the 
Purchase of gold abroad and the importation thereof into the United 
ates for licensed purposes." The Board of Governors therefore 
e leves that engaging in such activities under a Treasury license 
Â° u 
b e permissible for a corporation organized under section 25(a). 
Very truly yours,
