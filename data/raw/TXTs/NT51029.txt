Consent calendar. With a memorandum dated February 22, 1973, 
a staff task force submitted proposed revisions of the Board's Rules 
of Organization and Rules of Procedure. The Board approved the revi-
sions , which in general were intended to update the Rules by more 
current descriptions of the functions of the various divisions and 
offices of the Board and to take account of various changes in procedure, 
particularly with respect to bank holding company and merger appli-
cations , that had developed in the last few years. Copies of the 
revised Rules of Organization and Rules of Procedure are attached as 
Items 1 and 2. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of Boston Overseas 
Financial Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts, to acquire shares of Boston 
Investment and Financial Services S.A., Geneva, Switzerland. A copy 
of the letter sent to the applicant is attached as Item No. 3. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of Chase Manhattan 
Overseas Banking Corporation, New York, New York, for suspension of 
certain limitations on the financing activities of its subsidiary, Chase 
Manhattan Investment Co. (Thailand) Limited, Bangkok, Thailand, and 
for permission for that subsidiary to engage in the business of under-
writing or dealing in securities. A copy of the letter sent to the 
applicant is attached as Item No. A. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of The Chase 
Manhattan Bank (National Association), New York, New York, to acquire 
shares of Deutsche Familienbank A.G., Dusseldorf, Germany, a proposed

new bank that would specialize in consumer banking. A copy of the 
letter sent to the applicant is attached as Item No. 5. 
The Board unanimously approved the application of Doraco, 
Inc., Doraville, Georgia, to retain shares of The Northeast Commercial 
Bank, Doraville, Georgia, and authorized issuance of an order reflecting 
that decision. A copy is attached as Item No. 6. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Central Bancorp. Today's agenda called for further consid-
eration of the application of Central Bancorp, Inc., Miami, Florida, 
to acquire shares of Central National Bank of Miami. Action on the 
application had been deferred by the Board at its meeting on August 1, 
1972, pending the preparation of additional information on the applicant's 
plan to make a public offering of its common stock in an amount suffi-
cient to retire any debt incurred in the proposed acquisition. 
During the intervening months the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation had prepared an additional memorandum on this matter; 
the Banking Markets Section had conducted an investigation into the 
case; and several meetings had been held between the staff and princi-
pals, or representatives of the applicant. Finally, the 1972 earnings 
of the applicant's subsidiary banks and Central National Bank had been 
studied. On the basis of the findings, the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation in a memorandum dated February 16, 1973, recommended 
denial of the application.

At today's meeting the Board unanimously denied the application. 
It was understood that implementing documents would be prepared for 
the Board's consideration. 
Chairman Burns entered the meeting during the ensuing discussion. 
Delegation of authority. In a memorandum of February 27, 1973, 
Mr. Leavitt recommended that the Board delegate to the Federal Reserve 
Banks authority to approve on behalf of the Board certain multi-bank 
holding company formations and certain bank holding company and merger 
acquisitions of existing banks. Such action would relieve the Board 
and its staff of some of the workload associated with processing the 
increasing number of applications. 
Although it was generally agreed that some action in the 
direction proposed was desirable, concern was expressed about the 
difficulty of obtaining a uniform approach at all Reserve Banks. Also, 
it was suggested that members of the Board should have an opportunity 
to review a case before action on it was taken by a Reserve Bank under 
delegated authority. 
Question was raised as to whether the resources now being 
devoted to cases might not be excessive and it was agreed that consid-
eration should be given to the cost. As a means of expediting the 
processing of applications, the use of a checklist of facts needed to 
reach a decision was suggested, with the thought that such a list 
could be reviewed and a determination made as to whether additional 
information was needed before taking action.

At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that 
the proposed delegation of authority to Reserve Banks would be 
reviewed and brought back to the Board for further consideration. 
Policy record. In a memorandum dated February 23, 1973, 
Messrs. Coyne and Bernard described changes that had been made in 
the draft of the Annual Report policy record entries for the Board's 
discount rate disapprovals during 1972. These changes were in keeping 
with the Board's instructions at its meeting on February 15, 1973. 
On the basis of a suggestion by Governor Mitchell, a shorter version 
of the policy record for discount rate disapprovals was also submitted 
for the Board's consideration. In addition, there was attached to 
the February 23 memorandum a draft entry covering the Board's action 
on September 13, 1972, with regard to the extension of Federal Reserve 
credit to nonmember banks adversely affected by Regulation J. 
Various views for and against the two versions of the policy 
record were expressed. It was argued that the longer version was 
in line with the format used previously in the Annual Report for 
describing discount rate disapprovals, and it was believed that the 
views of individual Board members should be reported fully. On the 
other hand, the longer version was highly repetitious because of the 
similarity of the issues involved in the different entries. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the shorter version of 
the policy record on discount rate disapprovals was approved, with the 

7 
3/1/73 
-11-
understanding that a number of changes in wording would be made and 
that a summary of the views of Reserve Bank directors with respect 
to recommended discount rate changes would be included. Governor 
Brimmer, who had expressed a definite preference for the more detailed 
version, dissented. 
The Board also approved the policy record entry covering its 
decision on September 13, 1972, to extend Federal Reserve credit to 
nonmember banks adversely affected by Regulation J. 
System membership. At its meeting on February 6, 1973, the 
Board discussed a suggestion by President Mayo of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago that a change be made in the usual policy of routinely 
approving applications for waiver of the requirement of six months' 
notice of intention to withdraw from Federal Reserve membership. At 
the request of the Board, a draft policy statement was to be prepared 
expressing concern regarding withdrawals from the System and announcing 
that in the future waivers of the six-month waiting period would 
require Board approval (rather than Reserve Bank approval under delegated 
authority) and would be granted only in special circumstances. 
With a memorandum dated February 27, 1973, the Office of the 
Secretary submitted a draft of such a policy statement and a proposed 
amendment to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority that 
would withdraw the current authority for Reserve Banks to approve 
applications for waiver of the six-month notice of withdrawal requirement. 

8 
3/1/73 
-11-
After discussion at today's meeting the Board agreed that the 
current delegation relating to approval of waiver applications would 
not be withdrawn from the Reserve Banks but that the Board's Rules 
Regarding Delegation of Authority would be amended to authorize the 
Banks to deny, as well as approve, such applications. This amendment, 
which would be published in the Federal Register, would take the 
place of a separate policy statement. It was understood that the staff 
would prepare a revised draft amendment for the Board's consideration. 
It was also agreed that President Mayo would be informed of 
the Board's decision, and that in the interim period before the 
amendment was made effective he would be requested to approve pending 
waiver applications for four banks in the Seventh District. 
Foreign lending. Pursuant to a proposal by Governor Brimmer in 
a memorandum dated February 28, 1973, the Board discussed the kind of 
inquiry that might be sent by Federal Reserve Banks to U.S. banks and 
U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks on the changes in foreign 
lending during the recent period of speculative outflows. Under Secretary 
of the Treasury Volcker had asked the Board to obtain information on 
the role that banks may have played in the currency crisis, and it 
was proposed to obtain this type of information against the background 
of the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines. 
During discussion it was noted that the Division of Interna-
tional Finance was also working on another project that would require 

* 711 
3/1/73 
-8-
obtaining information relating to activities of U.S. banks and foreign 
branches in the area of foreign exchange trading. In addition, answers 
were needed to questions that had been raised by Chairman Patman of 
the Joint Economic Committee regarding overseas branches and affiliates 
of U.S. banks, outflows of dollars, and other subjects. All of this 
raised a question as to whether more than one questionnaire should be 
sent to the same financial institutions. In this connection, Chairman 
Burns expressed an interest in getting answers to basic questions 
without placing undue burden on the institutions involved. Governor 
Brimmer emphasized the desirability of moving ahead at an early date 
to obtain the information that had been requested by Under Secretary 
Volcker. 
At the conclusion of the discussion a committee consisting 
of Governors Brimmer, Daane, and Bucher was appointed to work with 
the staff in developing a procedure for obtaining the needed information. 
All members of the staff except Mr. Holland withdrew at this 
point. 
Board member assignments. Chairman Burns referred to his 
memorandum of February 28, 1973, to Board members describing various 
changes he proposed to make in Board member assignments. He invited 
comments and suggestions from the members of the Board before he took 
final action. In the ensuing discussion, it was suggested that the 
establishment of the proposed new Board Committee on Federal Reserve 

715

-11-
Board Officers' Salaries include a specific requirement that the 
recent practice of annual interviews of each member of the Board to 
ascertain his views on each Board staff officer be continued as an 
input to that Committee's deliberations. 
The Chairman indicated that, following receipt of any other 
suggestions the Board members might want to make to him individually, 
he would proceed to make revised assignments along the lines indicated. 
(Note: On March 8, 1973, Chairman Burns acted to establish the revised 
assignments for members of the Board and the Executive Director, as 
indicated in his memoranda of March 8, copies of which are attached 
as Items 7 and 8.) 
Messrs. Burke, Director, Division of Personnel Administration, 
and Mcintosh, Director, Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations, 
joined the meeting at this point. 
Salaries of Reserve Bank officers. Governor Sheehan presented 
the proposal of the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and 
Building Plans (contained in its memorandum dated February 28, 1973) 
regarding salary adjustments for Reserve Bank Presidents and First 
Vice Presidents. 
Governor Mitchell indicated his support for the proposal, 
stating that the move toward a performance evaluation/merit reward 
approach to salary administration for these levels of officers was 
a step in the right direction. 

716 
3/1/73 
-11-
Governor Brimmer indicated that he did not favor the proposal 
in that it would give adjustments to four Presidents and three First 
Vice Presidents who had received salary increases last year, which, 
in his mind, was not the intent of the Committee when it recommended 
reduced adjustments scheduled under the 1969 guidelines. Governor Daane 
indicated that this was not his understanding of the Committee's 
intention last year. 
After further discussion, the Board, with Governor Brimmer 
dissenting, approved the proposal contained in the Committee's memo-
randum of February 28, 1973. 
The annual salary rates approved by the Board for Presidents 
and First Vice Presidents of the respective Reserve Banks, effective 
January 1, 1973, are reflected in letters sent subsequent to this 
meeting to the respective Banks. Copies of the letters are attached 
as Items 9 through 20, inclusive. 
Presidency at Richmond. Chairman Burns reported that he had 
received a letter from Mr. Lawson, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond, reporting that the Board of Directors of the Richmond Bank 
had voted unanimously to nominate Mr. Robert P. Black, currently First 
Vice President of the Bank, to fill the vacant position of President, 
subject to approval by the Board of Governors. 
The members of the Board exchanged views as to the nature of 
Mr. Black's qualifications and the procedure to be followed in this 

717 
3/1/73 
-11-
matter. The Board members noted that this submission departed from 
the practice in most recent cases, inasmuch as a list containing only 
one name rather than more had been submitted to the Board for consid-
eration . 
The Board concluded that the Richmond directors should be 
informed of the essence of the discussion and that the Board would 
like the directors to supply the names of some additional candidates 
whom they would regard as well qualified for the position of President 
of the Bank, (Note: Mr. Holland orally and by confirming letter 
informed Chairman Lawson of the Board's views. Copies of Mr. Holland's 
memorandum and letter of March 6, 1973, regarding this matter have been 
placed in the Secretary's confidential file.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

SRC. 4. Field organisation. - (a) 
The United States is divided into twelve Federal Reserve districts. 
In one city in each Federal Reserve district there is located a Federal 
Reserve Bank; in ten of the districts there are one or more branches 
of the federal Reserve Bank in other cities; and in some districts 
there are offices or facilities with specialized functions. Each 
Federal Rese^re Bank is a separate legal entity, created pursuant to 
the Federal Reserve Act and operating under the general supervision 
of the Board. The locations of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and 
the twenty-four branches and the boundaries of the Federal Reserve 
disnrict and branch territories are shown in the Append!::. Each 
Federal Reserve Bank, in addition to its other duties, carries out 
local functions for the Hoard pursuant to instructions of the boards 
and in many matters acts as the Board's field representative in the 
Bank's district. Each Reserve, Bank assists in the regional adminis-
tration of the Board's regulations and policies, keeps the Board 
informed of local conditions, and recommends such actions as it thinks 

appropriate in particular cases. In general, persons concerned with 
Federal Reserve matters should deal in the first instance with the 
Federal Reserve Bank of the appropriate district or a branch thereof, 
and the Board requests all persons to follow this procedure. 
(b) Federal Reserve Agents. Each Federal Reserve Bank has 
nine directors, three o£ whom are appointed by the Board. One of the 
directors appointed by the Board is designated by the Board as Chairman 
of the Board of Directors of the Bank and as Federal Reserve Agent. He 
acts as the Board's official representative and maintains a local offic 
of the Board on the premises of the Federal Reserve Bank.

policy. However, the Board delegates certain of its supervisory and 
ether functions prescribed by statute or regulations of the. Board to 
its members or employees or to the Federal Reserve Banks as provided 
in its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12 CFR 2C5). In addi-
tion, the board delegates to the Federal Reserve Banks certain function 
not provided for by statute or regulations of the Board, Including au-
thority to extend the time within which certain transactions may be

CHAPTER IX - FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
SUECI!AITER A - BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
PART 262 - RULES OF PROCEDURE 
Revision of Rules 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has 
revised its Rules of Procedure in order to bring them into conformity 
with current practice and to make them more informative to the public. 
K 
Effective March 1, 1973, Part 262 is revised to read 
as fell ovs i 
RULES OF PROCEDURE 
Se c. 
262.1 Basis and scope. 
262*2 procedure for regulations, 
2 6213 App1ica t icns. 
262.4 Adjudication with formal hearing. 
2&2r5 Appearance and practice. 
202.6 Forma. 
AUTHORITY: 5 U.S.C. 552. 
5 2 62.1 B a si s and sr. ope. 
This Part is issued pursuant to section 552 of Title 5 oi 
the United States Code, which requires that every agency shall publish 
in the Federal Register statements of the general course and method by 

Which its functions arc channeled and determined, rules of procedure, 
and descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may 
he. obtained. 
5 262.2 Procrf.yJ!or regn[Iat:ipn s. 
(a) Notice. Notices of proposed regulations of the Board 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Board") or amendments 
thereto are published in the Federal Register, except as specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section or otherwise excepted by law. Such notices 
include a statement of the terms of the proposed regulations or amend-
ments and a description of the subjects and issues involved: but the 
giving of such notices does not necessarily indicate the Board's final 
Approval of: any feature of any such proposal. The notices also include 
R reference to the. authority for the proposed regulations cc amendments 
£nd a statement of the time, place, and nature of public participation. 
(i>) Pub lie participation. The usual method of public sub-
mission of data, views, or arguments is in writing. It is ordinarily 
Preferable that they be sent to the Secretary of the Board, Washington, 
r>< 
, 20551. with copies to the appropriate Federal "Reserve Bank. The 
-ocationrs of the twelve red oral Reserve Banks and the boundaries of the 
federal Vtesarvo districts are shown in the Appendix to the Board's 
of Oxganitation. Such material will be made available for in-
spection and copying upon request, except as provided in ? 261.6(a) 
this chapter regarding r.vailability of information. 

-10-
(c) Preparation of draft: and action by Board. In the light 
of consideration of all relevant matter presenter! or ascertained, the 
appropriate division of the Board's staff, in collaboration with other 
divisions, prepares drafts of proposed regulations or amendments, and 
the staff submits them to the Board. The Board fakes such action as 
it deems appropriate in the public interest. Any other documents that 
H»ay be necessary to carry out any decision by the Board in the matter 
are usually prepared, by the Legal Division, in collaboration with the 
other divisions of the staff. 
(d) Effective dates. Any substantive regulation or amendment 
thereto issued by the Board is published not less than 30 days prior to 
the effective date thereof, except as specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section or as otherwise excepted by law. 
(e) Exceptions as to notice or effective dace. In certain 
situations} notice and public participation with respect to proposed 
spallations may be impracticable, unnecessary, contrary to the public 
interest, or otherwise not required in the public interest, or there 
way be reason and good cause in the public interest why the effective 
date should not be deferred for 30 days. The reason or reasons in such 
cases usually are that such notice, public participation, or deferment 
of effective date would prevent the action from becoming effective as 
promptly as necessary in the public interest, would permit speculators 
or others to reap unfair profits or to interfere with the Board's 
actions taken with a view to accommodating commerce and business and 

with regard to their bearins upon the general credit situation of the. 
country, would provoke other consequences contrary to tlj& public in-
terest, would unreasonably interfere with the Board's necessary functions 
with respect to man.ngen-.enfc or personnel, would not aid the persons af-
fected, or would otherwise serve no useful purpose. The following may 
be mentioned as some examples of situations in which advance notice or 
deferred effective date, or both, will ordinarily be omitted in the 
Public, interest; The review and determination of discount rates estab-
lished by Federal Reserve Banks, and changes in general requirements 
regarding reserves of member banks, maximum interest rates on time and 
savings deposits, or credit for purchasing or carrying securities 
& 262.'» A%>piications, 
(a) Forms, Any application, request, or petition (hereafter 
referred to as "application") for the approval, authority, determination, 
°r permission of the Board with respect to any action for which such 
approval, authority, determination, or permission is required by law 
or regulation of the Board (including actions authorized to be taken 
by a Federal Reserve Bank or others on behalf of the Board pursuant to 
authority delegated under Part 265 of this chapter) shall be submitted 
accordance with the pertinent; form, if any, prescribed by the Board. 
Copies of any such form and details regarding information to be included

(c) Analysis by staff. In every case, the Reserve Bank makes 
such investigation as may be necessary, and, except when acting pursuant 
to delegated authority, reports the relevant facts, with its recommenda-
tion, to the Board. In the light of consideration of all relevant matter 
presented or ascertained, the Board's staff prepares and submits to the 
£oard comments on the subject.

set forth in Section 21.1.9(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation K„ 
You also have requested consent for CMIC to engage in 
the business of underwriting or dealing in securities. The Board's 
consent to such activities is conditioned upon your Corporation's

other purchasers, With respect to trading in securities in which 
Corporations are prohibited from investing by the provisions of 
the eighth paragraph of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, 
the Board's consent is further conditioned on the. fact that CMIC

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of January 3, 1973, the 
Board of: Governors grants permission, pursuant to Section 25 of 
Hie Federal Reserve Act and Regulation M, for The Chase Manhattan 
Bank National Association, ("CMB"), to purchase and hold all the 
shares of Deutsche Familienbank A, G., ("DFAG"), Dusseldorf, 
Germany, with one branch in Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, and 
Stuttgart, at a total cost of approximately $13,700,000, provided 
the shares are acquired within one year from the date of this 
letter. 
The Board's consent to the proposed holding of the shares 
of DFAG by CMB is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) Tliat such shares be disposed of as promptly as 
practicable if DFAG shall in any manner engage 
in any activity or take any action whatsoever 
that would not be permissible if DFAG were a 
corporation organized under Section 25(a) of 
the' Federal Reserve. Act not "engaged in banking"; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, 
CMB will furnish the Board with such reports 
regarding the activities of DFAG as it.may re-
quire from time to time; and 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by 
CMB be reported under Section 211.5(d) of 
Regulation K. in the same manner as if DFAG were 
a corporation organized under Section 25(a) of 
the Federal Reserve Act* 

743 
The Chase Manhattan Bank 
National -Association 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the immediately preceding paragraph of this letter so far as 
they relate to restrictions set forth in Section 211.9(a), (b), 
and (c) of Regulation K. 
. . 
With respect to DFAG's issuance of savings certificates 
of deposit with maturities in excess of one year, the Board does 
not construe Section 211.4 of Regulation K as applying to the 
issuance of obligations which evidence deposits received in the 
ordinary course of a banking business„ 
The Board also grants approval for DFAG to issue and 
have outstanding debentures, bonds, and promissory notes, or 
similar obligations with maturities in excess of one. year up to 
an amount of ten times DFAG's registered and paid-in capital. 
The foregoing consent is given on the condition that the 
investment will be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint Guide-
lines as they apply to The Chase Manhattan Bank National Association 
and its affiliates. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Tynan Smith

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
DORACO, INC. 
Order Approving Retention of Bank 
Doraco, Inc., Doraville, Georgia, a bank holding company within 
the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for the Board's 
approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to retain 58.2 
Per cent of the voting shares of The Northeast Commercial Bank Doraville, 
Borgia ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
the Board has considered the application and all comments received in light 
the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Since the inception of Bank ($3.4 million in deposits) in 1969, 
Applicant has owned 5,780 shares, or 24.08 per cent of the Bank's stock, 
with an option to purchase additional shares. Beginning June 28, 1972, 
Applicant exercised its option, purchasing 13,975 additional shares to 
bring its total ownership of shares in Bank to 19,755 or 82 per cent. 
The option was apparently exercised in the belief that Applicant already 
Controlled Bank, and that accordingly, prior Board approval was not required 
under § 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. § 1842(a)). Upon 
being informed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta that the Board's 
approval of the transaction was required, Applicant submitted the subject 
application. 
Applicant's retention of the additional shares would not signifi-
cantly affect competition between Bank and any competing institution, nor 

- 2 -
diminish the ability of Bank to meet the convenience and needs of its 
community. The financial and managerial resources of Applicant and Bank 
are satisfactory, and future prospects for both appear favorable. It 
is the Board's judgment that the proposed transaction is in the public 
interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
reasons summarized above. 
By order of the Board of Governors,—^ effective March 1, 1973.

Mr. James S. Duesenberry, Chairman 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 
Boston, Massachusetts 02106 
Dear Mr. Duesenberry: 
Confirming my telephone conversation with you of last 
week, the Beard of Governors has approved annual salaries of 
$57,750 for President Frank E. Morris and $42,500 for First 
Vice President E. 0, Latham, effective January 1, 1973. 
As I discussed with you over the telephone, the Board 
felt that, as a matter of policy, the aggregate adjustments in 
the salaries of the Presidents and First Vice Presidents taken 
as a group had to conform to the 5.5 per cent Pay Board standard 
under the Economic Stabilization Program. The individual adjust-
ments themselves varied, exceeding the standard in some cases, 
being less than the standard in other cases. These differences 
generally result from the fact that the individual adjustments 
have two components: 
(1) one-half of the normal increment under 
the 3 969 guidelines if the officer was either (a) scheduled for 
such an adjustment in 1973 or, (b) received only half of his 
scheduled adjustment last year and, (2) a merit increment based 
on performance evaluation. 
At the next Chairmen's Conference, tentatively scheduled 
for early summer, members of the Board's Committee on Organization, 
Compensation and Building Plans will be available to discuss with 
you individually and in some detail the methodology used and results 
of the evaluation of your officers' performance. Briefly, however, 
individual performances were evaluated in the following areas: 
(1) the level of contribution made at F0MC policy meetings, (2) the 
overall quality of the senior official staffs reporting to theN 

73? 
-9-
P-esident and First Vice President, (3) their management and operation 
of the Banks, and (A) the effectiveness of their efforts in developing 
and maintaining relationships with both the financial and non-financial 
communities in their Districts. In addition, we took into account any 
comments made by the Chairman of each Bank when their recommendation was 
forwarded to us. 
This being the first year any attempt has been made to adjust 
the salaries of the Presidents and First Vice Presidents on the basis 
of their performance, it stands to reason that the system can be im-
proved and should include a major input from your Board. Because we 
recognized this need for improvement, the merit portion or the salary 
adjustments was limited to one-third of the total pool available for 
salary adjustments; the remaining two-thirds was distributee under 
the modified 1969 guidelines. 
The Board wants to move away from mechanistic routines toward 
a totally performance-oriented system. Hopefully, this will be the 
last vear of following the guidelines—even in part—in developing 
salary adjustments for these officers. As soon as possible we want 
to be on a full merit svstem. Success in attaining this goal will 
depend, in large measure, on the Chairmen's progress in developing 
goals and objectives for each Bank and a system to evaluate trie 
progress made toward obtaining those goals and objectives. _ Assuming 
this is accomplished before the 19 74 salary reviews are initiated the 
present salary guidelines will be totally abandoned and there will be 
no makeup of that portion, if any, of the 1969 guideline increment 
withheld this year. 
Furthermore, we intend that this be the last year in which 
year-to-year increases are granted. The Board intends—and given 
industry practice, expects that the Chairmen would concur—that salary 
increases for the two top officers be granted every other, and m 
some cases, every third year. 
Should you wish clarification on the points discussed, 
please call. 
Sincerely, 
J o M E. Sheehan

you individually and in some detail the methodology used and results 
of the evaluation of your officers' performance. Briefly, however, 
individual performances were evaluated in the following areas: 
(1) the level of contribution made at FOMC policy meetings, (2) the 
overall quality of the senior official staffs reporting to the 

- 2 -
President and First Vice President, (3) their management and operation 
of the Banks, and (4) the effectiveness of their efforts in developing 
and maintaining relationships with both the financial and non-financial 
communities in their Districts. In addition, we took into account any 
comments made by the Chairman of each Bank when their recommendation was 
forwarded to us. 
This being the first year any attempt has been made to adjust 
the salaries of the Presidents and First Vice Presidents on the basis 
of their performance, it stands to reason that the system can be im-
proved and should include a major input from your Board. Because we 
recognized this need for improvement, the merit portion of the salary 
adjustments was limited to one-third of the total pool available for 
salary adjustments; the remaining two-thirds was distributed under 
the modified 1969 guidelines. 
The Board wants to move away from mechanistic routines toward 
a totally performance-oriented system. Hopefully, this will be the 
last year of following the guidelines—even in part—in developing 
salary adjustments for these officers. As soon as possible we want 
to be on a full merit system. Success in attaining this goal will 
depend, in large measure, on the Chairmen's progress in developing 
goals and objectives for each Bank and a system to evaluate the 
progress made toward obtaining those goals and objectives. Assuming 
this is accomplished before the 1974 salary reviews are initiated, the 
present salary guidelines will be totally abandoned and there will be 
no makeup of that portion, if any, of the 1969 guideline increment 
withheld this year. 
Furthermore, we intend that this be the last year in which 
year-to-year increases are granted. The Board intends—and given 
industry practice, expects that the Chairmen would concur—that salary 
increases for the two top officers be granted every other, and in 
some cases, every third year, 
Should you wish clarification on the points discussed, 
please call.

Dear Mr. Lawson: 
Confirming my telephone conversation with you of last 
week, the Board of Governors has approved annual salaries of 
$54,000 for former President Aubrey N. Heflin and $42,750 for First 
Vice President Robert P. Black, effective January 1, 1973, 
As I discussed with you over the telephone, the Board 
felt that, as a matter of policy, the aggregate adjustments in 
the salaries of the Presidents and First Vice Presidents taken 
as a group had to conform to the 5.5 per cent Pay Board standard 
under the Economic Stabilization Program. The individual adjust-
ments themselves varied, exceeding the standard in some cases, 
being less than the standard in other cases. These differences 
generally result from the fact that the individual adjustments 
have two components: (1) one-half of the normal increment under 
the 1969 guidelines if the officer was either (a) scheduled for 
such an adjustment in 1973 or, (b) received only half of his 
scheduled adjustment last year and, (2) a merit increment based 
on performance evaluation. 
At the next Chairmen's Conference, tentatively scheduled 
for early summer, members of the Board's Committee on Organization, 
Compensation and Building Plans will be available to discuss with 
you individually and in some detail the methodology used and results 
of the evaluation of your officers' performance. Briefly, however, 
individual performances were evaluated in the following areas:

overall quality of the senior official staffs reporting to the

of the Banks, and (4) the effectiveness of their efforts in developing 
and maintaining relationships with both the financial and non-financiai 
communities in their Districts. In addition, we took into account any 
comments made by the Chairman of each Bank when their recommendation was

I promised you over the telephone an explanation as to 
why Ernie was not eligible this year for an adjustment under the 
1969 guidelines. Having been appointed First Vice President in 
April 1970, accompanied by a salary increase of $5,000, Ernie was 
"scheduled" for a $3,500 salary adjustment in January 1972,. How-
ever, nine months after his appointment, i.e., January 1, 1971, he 
was "advanced" $2,000 of the $3,500 "scheduled" the next year. 
On January 1, 1972, he was given the remainder—or $1,500. There-
fore, with respect to the every other year concept of the 1969 
guidelines, Ernie was "on schedule" and his next programmed adjust-
ment would be January 1974. 
Should you wish clarification on the points discussed, 
please call.

ments themselves varied, exceeding the standard in some cases, 
being less than the standard in other cases. These differences 
generally result from the fact that the individual adjustments 
have two components: 
(1) one-half of the normal increment under 
the 1969 guidelines if the officer was either (a) scheduled for 
such an adjustment in 1973 or, (b) received only half of his 
scheduled adjustment last year and, (2) a merit increment based 
on performance evaluation. 
At the next Chairmen's Conference, tentatively scheduled 
for early summer, members of the Board's Committee on Organization, 
Compensation and Building Plans will be available to discuss with 
you individually and in some detail the methodology used and results 
of the evaluation of your officers' performance. Briefly, however, 
individual performances were evaluated in the following areas: 
(1) the level of contribution made at FOMC policy meetings, (2) the 
overall quality of the senior official staffs reporting to the 

President and First Vice President, (3) their management and operation 
of the Banks, and (4) the effectiveness of their efforts in developing 
and maintaining relationships with both the financial and non-financial 
communities in their Districts. In addition, we took into account any 
comments made by the Chairman of each Eank when their recommendation was 
forwarded to us. 
This being the first year any attempt has been made to adjust 
the salaries of the Presidents and First Vice Presidents on the basis 
of their performance, it stands to reason that the system can be im-
proved and should include a major input from your Board. Because we 
recognized this need for improvement, the merit portion of the salary 
adjustments was limited to one-third of the total pool available for 
salary adjustments; the remaining two-thirds was distributed under 
the modified 1969 guidelines. 
The Board wants to move away from mechanistic routines toward 
a totally performance-oriented system. Hopefully, this will be the 
last year of following the guidelines—even in part—in developing 
salary adjustments for these officers. As soon as possible we want 
to be on a full merit system. Success in attaining this goal will 
depend, in large measure, on the Chairmen's progress in developing 
goals and objectives for each Bank and a system to evaluate the 
progress made toward obtaining those goals and objectives. Assuming 
this is accomplished before the 1974 salary reviews are initiated, the 
present salary guidelines will be totally abandoned and there will be 
no makeup of that portion, if any, of the 1969 guideline increment 
withheld this year. 
Furthermore, we intend that this be the last year in which 
year-to-year increases are granted. The Board intends—and given 
industry practice, expects that the Chairmen would concur—that salary 
increases for the two top officers be granted every other, and in 
some cases, every third year. 
Should you wish clarification on the points discussed, 
please call. 
Sincerely, 
Joh/ E. Sheehan
