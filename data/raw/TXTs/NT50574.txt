Chairman Burns prefaced consideration of today's agenda with 
remarks regarding the possibility of extending delegation of authority 
to additional matters. 
It appeared to him that most of the items on 
the agenda might be handled on that basis, including approval of officer 
salaries at Federal Reserve Banks in the absence of circumstances in 
any given case that would warrant consideration by the Board as a whole. 
The following letters were then approved unanimously after 
consideration of background information that had been made available 
to the Board. Copies are attached under the respective item numbers 
indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to Union International Bank, Los Angeles, 
1 
California, granting permission to issue promissory 
notes of over one year to the Export-Import Bank. 
Letter to Citizens Bank, Westminster, Colorado, 
2 
approving its application for membership in the 
Federal Reserve System. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
3 
approving the payment of salaries to Charles R. 
Pricher as Assistant Vice President, Whitney R. 
Irwin as Manager, and Richard Vollkommer as Manager 
at the rates set by the Bank's Board of Directors. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
4 
approving the payment of salaries to Patricia W. 
Richards and Roby L. Sloan, each as Assistant 
Vice President, at the rates set by the Bank's 
Board of Directors. 
Report on competitive factors. Unanimous approval was given 
to a report, for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency, on the 

409 
2/3/70 
-3-
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of The Warren County 
National Bank, Washington, New Jersey, with The Second Warren County 
National Bank, also of Washington. The conclusion stated that consumma-
tion of the proposed transaction, designed to facilitate a bank holding 
company acquisition, would in itself have no adverse competitive effects. 
Architectural consulting services (Item No. 5). A memorandum 
dated January 26, 1970, from the Division of Federal Reserve Bank Opera-
tions referred to the authorization given by the Board on July 17, 1969, 
to explore the possibility of entering into an agreement with Keyes, 
Lethbridge & Condon, Washington, D. C., to provide architectural advice 
in connection with Federal Reserve construction projects. A proposed 
agreement, attached to the memorandum, had been reviewed by the Board's 
Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, and the 
Division recommended execution of the agreement. A draft of transmittal 
letter to the firm also was submitted with the memorandum. 
After discussion, the execution of the agreement was authorized. 
Copies of the letter to the firm and of the agreement are attached as 
Item No. 5. 
All members of the staff then withdrew except Mr. Holland. 
Chairman Burns raised for further discussion the question of 
various Board administrative procedures. General interest was expressed 
in exploring the possibility of further delegation of Board authority 
to act on various types of matters, including most if not all of the 

410 
2/3/70 
-4-
kinds of items represented on the Board's regular agenda this morning. 
Governor Sherrill was asked to undertake the responsibility of develop-
ing, with the aid of staff, specific proposals for further delegations 
of authority, to be brought forward for Board consideration in as timely 
a fashion as feasible. 
Discussion then turned to some of the economic implications of 
the just-published Federal Budget for fiscal 1971. Chairman Burns 
outlined for the other members of the Board some of the key thinking 
underlying the new budget and asked that the staff prepare an analysis 
of the budget, with particular attention to whether in their analytical 
judgment it contained as many "gimmicks" as had been present in previous 
budgets.,; 
:; ,.>, \ 
Note was .taken of the Presidential decision to postpone the 
contemplated general increase in salaries of Federal employees for six 
months, from the middle of calendar 1970 to the end of that year. Recog-
nizing the importance of such postponement as an example, the Board 
asked the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans 
to investigate prospective salary increases at the Reserve Banks during 
calendar 1970, and to bring to the Board a report of their findings 
and recommendations as to an appropriate Federal Reserve posture with 
respect to salary increases in the light of the postponement of Civil 
Service pay increases.

Chairman Burns then asked for discussion concerning Federal 
Reserve handling of bank merger and holding company cases. In particular, 
he asked for an expression of views as to the desirability of aiming 
for processing of all but the most difficult cases within a 90-day time 
interval. Various problems with measurement, scheduling, and operations 
were mentioned, but there appeared to be general sympathy with the 
objective of moving to such a target. In that discussion, mention was 
also made of the desirability of developing appropriate information on 
the timing of various stages of handling such applications and the 
maintenance of a continuous inventory of cases in process. The Board 
asked Governor Sherrill to undertake the development of suitable procedures 
for moving to an interim target of processing all but unusually difficult 
cases within 
a 90-day period. Governor Sherrill noted that a memorandum 
proposing some staff reorganization that would facilitate improved 
processing had been distributed to the Board, and it was agreed this 
memorandum would be docketed for discussion at an early Board meeting. 
The meeting then adjourned.
