Request by Consumers Union for individual bank data on interest 
^ t p Q 
T in a memorandum of August 24, 1973, Mr. Coyne recommended denial 
O f 
£1 
ne request of Consumers Union, Washington, D. C., which represented 

3286 
8/28/73 
-2-
San Francisco Consumer Action, San Francisco, California, for data 
from individual banks that underlie the Board's G.10 statistical 
release, Interest Rates Charged on Selected Types of Bank Loans. 
The Board unanimously denied the request. A copy of the 
letter sent to Consumers Union is attached as Item No. 1. 
The following representatives of the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency entered the meeting at this point: 
Mr. James E. Smith, Comptroller of the Currency, sitting as 
a member of the Board 
Mr. Westbrook Murphy, Assistant General Counsel 
Mr. Robert B. Serino, Director of Enforcement and Compliance 
Removal proceedings. 
The Board today again considered the 
matter of instituting removal proceedings against Mr. Louis J. Roussel, 
Chairman of the Board of Directors, National American Bank of New 
Or leans, New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as his son, Mr. Louie J. Roussel, 
President and member of the Board of Directors of the bank. 
On August 1, 1972, the Board voted to commence removal proceed-
ings against Louis J. Roussel under the Financial Institutions Super-
visory Act of 1966, pursuant to a certification by the Comptroller of 
t h c Currency, and on February 15, 1973, the Board authorized issuance 
Of a „ ^• 
r . 
notice of intention to remove Mr. Roussel from office. 
However, 
K 
c 
e ore the notice could be served upon Mr. Roussel, it became known 
f-L 
a t two of the principal witnesses in the Board's case had been indicted 
by <i 
ct grand jury in New Orleans (on charges unrelated to the Roussel case).

The notice was therefore recalled, pending consideration of these 
changed circumstances. 
At its meeting on April 23, 1973, the Board referred the 
question of removal proceedings against Mr. Roussel back to the Office 
of the Comptroller for further investigation—particularly of a Decem-
ber 1972 transaction involving Mr. Roussel—and for possible recerti-
fication. 
Pursuant to the investigation, which focused primarily on the 
December 5, 1972, transaction that involved a $500,000 payment by 
National American Bank of New Orleans to Mr. C. Ellis Henican, the 
Comptroller of the Currency on June 15, 1973, issued a recertification 
regarding Mr. Roussel and in addition requested the Board to take 
whatever steps would be necessary to remove his son, Louie J. Roussel, 
as well, from National American Bank as soon as possible. 
Messrs. O'Connell, Oehmann, and Marinaccio, in a memorandum of 
August 24, 1973, recommended issuance of a notice of intention to 
remove Mr. Roussel and his son as officers and directors of National 
erican Bank, and submitted a draft notice for the Board's consideration. 
Subsequent to the preparation of the August 24 memorandum, 
Gallinghouse, U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, 
in 
a telegram dated August 27, 1973, stated that Department of Justice 
°^ficials intended to conduct a grand jury investigation in New Orleans 
^uring September and early October concerning the circumstances surrounding 

3288 
8/28/73 
-4-
the payment to Mr. Henican, and urged the Board to suspend its adminis-
trative proceedings pending development of a criminal case. 
After consultation with Justice Department officials in 
Washington, Messrs. O'Connell and Marinaccio recommended that the Board 
hold in abeyance until October 10, 1973, any further action in this 
matter in order to permit the grand jury to undertake criminal proceed-
l n§ s without possible prejudice by any Board action. Mr. Herbert J. 
filler, Jr., Special Counsel to the Board, although not present at 
today's meeting, had expressed his concurrence with this proposal. 
Mr. Smith urged the Board not to hold action completely in 
abeyance but to take a positive step forward now to remove Mr. Roussel 
and his son. Mr. Smith agreed, however, that in light of the conversa-
tion by Messrs. O'Connell and Marinaccio with Department of Justice 
officials, actual issuance of the notice of intent to remove should be 
Postponed until after October 10. 
The Board unanimously affirmed its prior decision to issue a 
n°tice of intention to remove Mr. Roussel and his son, it being under-
stood that such action would be held in abeyance until October 10. During 
the intervening period, it was further understood that consultations 
between the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 
fcH 
e department of Justice would continue and that the Board would be kept 
lnformed of the status of the legal proceedings in New Orleans. 
In addi-
t^0n> the Board authorized the legal staff of the Board and the Comptroller 

H28S

of the Currency to make such additions to the proposed notice as deemed 
necessary to strengthen the case. A copy of the letter sent to U.S. 
Attorney Gallinghouse is attached as Item No. 2. 
The meeting then adjourned.
