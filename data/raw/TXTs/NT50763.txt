Following extremely heavy intervention purchases of dollars early 
in their trading days, five European central banks, led by the Bundesbank 
had withdrawn from support operations in their exchange markets. It was 
expected that the central banks of Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and Austria would not re-enter their markets at least until 
Monday. 
The probable effects of these and related developments were 
discussed, along with the options apparently available to the German

authorities and the consequences of resort to a floating rate for the 
mark, if that should be the decision. 
There was also a brief report on the New York money market at 
today's opening, along with actions that might be taken by the Treasury 
in support of the current refunding and open market operations contem-
plated by the Trading Desk. 
It was noted that the Treasury statement yesterday to the effect 
that no change in the structure of currency parities was necessary 
reflected the official U.S. Government position at this time, and that 
. . . 
inquiries received at the Board's offices should be dealt with accordingly. 
Chairman Burns requested that members of the Board keep the Secre-
tary informed of their whereabouts in order that they might be reached on
