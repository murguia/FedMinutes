Policy record entry. With a memorandum from Mr. Broida dated 
June 25, 1968, there had been submitted the proposed policy record 
entry covering the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held 
on April 2, 1968. The entry was submitted for final review by the 
Board prior to release to the press, which was contemplated on Monday, 
July 1. The entry had been approved by the Board on June 17, and no 
further suggestions had been received. 
The release of the material to the press on July 1 was approved 
unanimously. 
Use of condition and earnings data (Item No. 1). The Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had submitted for clearance by the Board 
the request of a graduate student of the University of Minnesota for 
access to 1964 and 1965 condition and earnings data reported by banks 
in the Ninth District, which data would be used in the preparation of 
a doctoral dissertation relating to economies of scale and banking 
market structure. The Reserve Bank believed that the results of the 
study would be beneficial to it. 
In a memorandum dated June 18, 1968, Mr. Langham expressed the 
v i e w that, regardless of the desirability of the proposed study, main-
tenance of confidentiality of condition and earnings data reported by 
individual banks was an overriding factor. He recommended that the 
request not be approved unless effective protective arrangements could 
be developed comparable to those set up by the Federal Reserve Bank of 

2460 
6/26/68 
-3-
Chicago in 1965 in connection with a research study by a graduate 
student. A letter to the Minneapolis Reserve Bank along such lines 
was attached for consideration. 
Governor Mitchell recalled that efforts made several years ago 
to devise a procedure under which individual bank data could be made 
available more liberally had not produced a solution to the kind of 
problem now under consideration. 
The general rule had been not to 
disclose information about individual banks. This rule had been 
breached to some extent by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
but he thought it was still a good rule and that it was necessary to 
set up appropriate safeguards. 
Governor Brimmer noted that it might not be feasible to estab-
lish such safeguards in this case inasmuch as the research student 
reportedly was leaving the Ninth District to reside in Kentucky. 
He 
observed that questions of this kind were continually being presented. 
For example, an inquiry had been received from a younger man who wanted 
t o prepare a study of banking markets and desired access to staff memo-
randa on merger applications. One possibility was that the man might 
be made an employee of the Federal Reserve so that he would have access 
t o the materials, with an understanding that his product would be 
r evlewed to assure that confidential information was not improperly 
divulged. 
There was much to be gained by having able persons look into 
Problems with which the Federal Reserve was dealing, although that 

2161 
6/26/68 
-4-
should be done in such manner as to respect the confidentiality of 
data for individual banks. 
Governor Robertson stated that he would be inclined to follow 
the recommendation of those who had worked with this question for many 
years, and Governor Maisel noted that the Minneapolis Bank presumably 
had considered the possibility of employing the graduate student who 
wanted to make the study now under consideration. 
After further discussion unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in the form attached 
as Item No. 1. 
Foreign borrowing by U.S. banks. The Board had recently 
approved the acquisition by Marine Midland International Corporation 
(an Edge Act subsidiary of Marine Midland Banks, Inc., a bank holding 
company) of Marine Midland Overseas Corporation, a company newly incor-
porated in the State of Delaware for the purpose of investing abroad. 
The Board ruled that Marine Midland Overseas Corporation should be 
treated as a bank for purposes of the foreign credit restraint program. 
However, the Board also approved an exception to a general rule apply-
ing to banks in that it held that Marine Midland Overseas Corporation 
could offset against its foreign claims, for purposes of reporting 
under the credit restraint program, the amount of any funds borrowed 
abroad with maturity of three years or more. In that connection, 
question had been raised whether future approval of applications for 

6/26/68 
-5-
equity investments by foreign subsidiaries of banks or Edge corpora-
tions should also be conditioned upon their being financed by foreign 
borrowings with maturities of at least three years. 
In a memorandum dated June 24, 1968, Mr. Sammons pointed out 
that, although there was always some risk that deposits and funds 
borrowed by foreign branches or subsidiaries of U.S. banks would repre-
sent funds that would otherwise be held in the United States, it had 
been felt from the beginning of the foreign credit restraint program 
that it was desirable to exclude the assets of foreign branches and 
subsidiaries from the guidelines. To do otherwise would significantly 
impair the ability of such branches and subsidiaries to carry on normal 
operations in foreign countries. Therefore, it did not appear that 
any useful purpose would be served by preventing foreign subsidiaries 
°f U.S. banks and Edge corporations from making equity investments or 
loans in continental Western Europe. 
Mr. Sammons recommended that the Board continue to apply only 
normal banking principles in passing on those investments of foreign 
subsidiaries that required Board approval and that no effort be made 
impose limitations on the maturity of the obligations incurred by 
the foreign institutions to finance such investments. 
However, the 
banking community should clearly understand that any additional invest-
ment by the U.S. enterprise to enable the foreign subsidiary to retain 
investments in, or other claims on, developed countries of continental 

2 4 1 > 3 
6/26/68 
-6-
Western Europe acquired after January 1, 1968, would be contrary to 
the guidelines no matter in what country the subsidiary was located. 
This understanding could be underscored by the inclusion of an appro-
priate paragraph in letters consenting to equity investments by foreign 
subsidiaries. 
After summarizing his memorandum, Mr. Sammons noted that the 
substance of the paragraph suggested for inclusion in letters of con-
sent could, if the Board so desired, be issued in the form of a general 
statement. 
Governor Brimmer said that he supported the memorandum and 
that for the time being he would like to stop short of including the 
suggested paragraph in the guidelines of the foreign credit restraint 
program. He felt that it would be desirable to accumulate more expe-
rience before deciding whether to take that step. 
Governor Robertson suggested that careful consideration be 
given to the position in which the Board might place itself in approv-
ing equity investments in continental Western Europe, particularly in 
relation to the Commerce Department program. 
Mr. Sammons remarked that under the Commerce program a European 
subsidiary of an industrial company would not be prohibited from float-
ing a bond issue in Europe and using the proceeds to buy another com-
pany. it was only the transfer of funds from the U.S. that counted. 
Governor Robertson agreed but expressed concern about the image 
°f the Federal Reserve if it specifically approved equity investments 

Z l i 
6/26/68 
-7-
in continental Western Europe, even though made by a foreign subsidiary 
of a U.S. bank rather than the bank itself. Deposits might be pulled 
out of the U.S. bank and transferred into obligations of the subsidiary. 
He was merely suggesting that the matter be thought through carefully 
before a position was taken. 
Governor Brimmer said that this was the reason he had cautioned 
against a public statement at this time. 
Chairman Martin then suggested that the matter be left in 
Governor Brimmer's hands, and there was agreement with this suggestion. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that it would be desirable to 
adopt a position as soon as possible as a matter of equity to all 
interested parties. 
Reserve Bank budgets (Item No. 2). With a memorandum of 
June 21, 1968, the Division of Bank Operations submitted a review of 
the budgets of the Federal Reserve Banks and branches for the last 
half of 1968. 
In view of the recently enacted legislation calling for a $6 
billion reduction in Government expenditures in fiscal 1969, and in 
view of the Board's apparent feeling that the Federal Reserve System 
should conform to the spirit of that legislation, it was suggested 
that the Board might want to request the Reserve Banks to take appro-
priate action with regard to their proposed budgets and planned capital 
outlays. 
Submitted with the memorandum was a draft of letter to the 

6/26/68 
-8-
Reserve Banks that would state that the Board had accepted the budgets 
of all of the Banks for the last half of 1968 with the understanding 
that each Bank would review its proposed expenditures to see where 
reductions could be made and inform the Board as soon as possible of 
items that could be deleted. Several areas would be suggested in 
which there might be opportunities for reductions. The view also 
would be expressed that, in general, capital outlays should be delayed 
until the economic climate had improved. There might, of course, be 
extenuating circumstances in some cases, in which event the Board 
should be advised of such circumstances when specific approval was 
being sought. 
Information would also be requested on capital-type 
expenditures planned for the second half of 1968 and the first half 
of 1969 that could be delayed to a later date. 
Governor Mitchell said he thought the sending of such a letter 
was appropriate, and there was general agreement with that view. 
Governor Brimmer inquired how it was proposed to treat expen-
ditures for the purchase of coin separation machines under the agree-
ment that had been reached by the Treasury. Mr. Kiley replied that 
the expense would be prorated among the Banks, and Governor Brimmer 
S uggested specifying in the letter that such expenditures to implement 
the coin separation program were considered necessary. 
Governor Brimmer also suggested that the Reserve Banks should 
not be given the impression that savings were expected to be made at 

6/26/68 
-9-
the expense of normal salary adjustments, particularly in light of the 
current Federal pay increase. 
Mr. Farrell said he thought there was a requirement in the 
Federal legislation that the pay increase must be absorbed by the 
agencies, and Mr. Kakalec commented further to the same effect. 
Staff 
members also commented that it was believed to be implicit in the pro-
posed letter that the Reserve Banks would make normal salary adjust-
ments . 
Mr. Farrell then referred to certain instances, as at Denver, 
where capital expenditures were considered to be urgent and said it 
was the view of the staff that such items should be considered by the 
Board on an ad hoc basis according to the merits of the individual 
cases. There was general agreement with this view. Governor Maisel 
indicated that he would regard acquisition of land, which involved 
simply the transfer of a capital asset, as distinguishable from other 
types of capital expenditures. 
Mr. Brill mentioned that heads of research at the Reserve Banks 
wight raise questions about the effect of the letter in terms of making 
replacements and net additions to the research staff. He stated that 
such interpretation as the Board considered appropriate could be 
passed along at the time of the next System Research Advisory Committee 
meeting. 
Governor Brimmer said he would interpret the letter to mean that, 
while new recruiting programs should not be undertaken, negotiations 

246 
6/26/68 
-10-
already under way could be completed. Governor Maisel added that he 
thought the Board's interpretation, in reappraising its own budget, 
was that plans could proceed where output was expected to have an 
impact on monetary policy in the next year. Governor Mitchell sug-
gested that the Reserve Banks should not be required to terminate 
negotiations that were in the pipeline, and Governor Robertson observed 
that if a Reserve Bank had been negotiating with a man and his acquisi-
tion was important to monetary policy, the Bank should go ahead. 
How-
ever, Reserve Banks should terminate negotiations if they were not far 
advanced and the filling of the position was not immediately necessary. 
Governor Brimmer observed that the New York Bank was attempting 
to participate in a program that involved bringing in people with 
minimum skills and upgrading them. He felt that that kind of program 
should be encouraged, and he gathered that it was being urged by the 
Conference of Presidents. He suggested that the Reserve Banks be 
advised to go forward with such programs if they could meet the expense 
by cutting back elsewhere. 
After further discussion Mr. Farrell noted that according to 
the terms of the proposed letter the Board would have an opportunity 
to review what the Reserve Banks proposed to do. 
Unanimous approval then was given to a letter to the Federal 
Res erve Banks in the form attached as Item No. 2. 
Governor Daane joined the meeting during the foregoing discus-
sion. At its conclusion Mr. Fleming, Consultant on truth in lending 

2468 
6/26/68 
-11-
matters, entered the room along with Messrs. Burstein and Cochran of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and Dallas, respectively, 
who also were working on the truth in lending program. 
Advisory Committee on Truth in Lending. With a memorandum 
dated June 19, 1968, the Task Force on Truth in Lending submitted two 
memoranda concerning the Advisory Committee on Truth in Lending to be 
appointed by the Board. One discussed the proposed functions, composi-
tion, and operations of the Advisory Committee, while the other sub-
mitted names that had been assembled from various sources and presented 
a suggested list of members for the Board's consideration. 
Copies of 
these memoranda have been placed in the Board's files. 
Governor Robertson noted that the members of the Advisory Com-
mittee should be appointed as soon as practicable. 
He pointed out that 
a committee of 12 members was recommended, with fair representation of 
the interests of lenders, sellers of merchandise on credit, and the 
public. 
Governor Robertson further said that the individuals recom-
mended were not known to him personally and that the tentative selec-
tions had been made on the basis of apparent competence, with as much 
geographical distribution as possible and representation of as many 
different areas of business as possible. 
Governor Mitchell expressed the view that a larger committee 
would be desirable. His thought was to appoint 36 persons, three from 

2469 
6/26/68 
-12-
each Federal Reserve District. He observed that the factor of public 
relations was particularly important in this area and said he thought 
it would be worth whatever cost might be involved in bringing together 
a larger committee. He also suggested that the chairman should not be 
a Board member but someone from the membership of the Advisory Commit-
tee . 
Governor Brimmer said he was inclined to favor Governor 
Mitchell's view that the Federal Reserve Districts might provide the 
basic framework for organization of the Advisory Committee. He went 
on to say that the material submitted did not provide sufficient 
criteria for selection to allow the Board to defend itself against 
criticism. He would prefer first to establish criteria and then look 
at individuals in terms of those criteria. He doubted whether the 
Advisory Committee should be looked upon as a technical working group; 
instead, he felt that people should be selected who would do a superior 
job of public information. He also indicated that he was particularly 
interested in the public members and had some ideas about persons who 
might be appropriate. 
Governor Daane expressed the view that a 36-man committee 
would be too large if the purpose was anything more than window 
dressing, but he felt that a framework of organization according to 
Federal Reserve Districts might be appropriate. 
Governor Maisel commented that he would be prepared to increase 
the committee to 16 or 18 members simply to increase the number of 

6/26/68 
-13-
public members, for he felt that they should be equal in total to the 
members from the other groups combined. He doubted that it would be 
feasible to appropriately represent interest groups and at the same 
time select an even number of people from each Federal Reserve Distric 
Governor Mitchell withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
In further discussion Governors Daane and Brimmer indicated 
that they were attracted to an organizational setup along the lines 
suggested by Governor Maisel. 
Chairman Martin commented that this was a matter to which all 
members of the Board should give their close attention in the initial 
stages. A major public relations problem was involved, and it was 
important to get off to a good start on a basis that would be defen-
sible. Therefore, the criteria for selection should be pulled togethe 
and agreed upon. After that, and after the Advisory Committee was 
appointed, the Board might want to designate one Board member to have 
administrative responsibility for truth in lending regulation, but at 
the outset all Board members should be involved. 
Further discussion developed a consensus that there would be 
merit in having a committee of 18 members that would include 9 members 
representing the public sector. There also appeared to be a consensus 
that the chairman of the Advisory Committee should be a member of the 
committee. 
Governor Robertson suggested that any Board member who had 
knowledge with respect to the persons suggested for membership on the 

2471 
6/26/68 
-14-
Advisory Committee, or others who should be considered, get in touch 
with the staff. He believed it would be desirable to announce the 
membership around the middle of July so that a meeting of the Advisory 
Committee could be called as early as August. 
The discussion concluded with an understanding that a statement 
of criteria would be developed, that there would be further discussions 
by the Board from time to time to the extent that the staff needed 
guidance, and that the designation of the Advisory Committee members 
should be made about the middle of July at a time when all members of 
the Board were present. 
All staff members except Mr. Holland then withdrew. 
Returning to the subject of the organization and composition 
of the proposed Advisory Committee on Truth in Lending, the Chairman 
emphasized the need to establish appropriate criteria for membership 
selection in view of the keen and widespread interest in this matter. 
He felt the members of the Board should give close and continuing 
attention to this problem with a view to achieving as unified a posi-
tion as possible on the questions involved. 
In subsequent discussion, the pros and cons of having as 
Advisory Committee chairman a Board member or an outside representa-
tive were further reviewed. Attention was also given to arrangements 
by which the comments of the banking industry on the program could be 
received, either through the forum of the Federal Advisory Council or 

6/26/68 
-15-
by establishment of a separate liaison committee. As a further possi-
bility, it was suggested that each of the Government agencies adminis-
tering the proposed regulation might establish a committee composed of 
representatives from their respective areas of responsibility to advise 
them on pertinent problems. 
Such committees would be junior to the 
national Advisory Committee, but would provide more widespread channels 
for communication and counsel. 
It was agreed that these and all other suggestions expressed 
at the meeting would be taken under advisement by the members, and 
that the matter would be placed on the agenda for further discussion 
in the next few days. 
The meeting then adjourned.

ADDRESS OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE 
TO THE BOARD 
June 28, 1968. 
Mr. Roland D. Graham, General Counsel, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
55440 
Dear M r . Graham: 
The Board has considered your proposal of June 3, 1968, 
that coded data reported by individual member and nonmember banks 
in the Ninth Federal Reserve District be made available to 
Mr. Stuart Schweitzer for use in a study relating to economies of 
scale and bank market structure in your District. 
Although the Board recognizes that the proposed study 
could be of significant benefit to the banking community and to the 
System, further steps to insure the maintenance of confidentiality 
°f individual bank data would be essential before the information 
could be made available for use by Mr. Schweitzer. Plans to insure 
the maintenance of confidentiality should include the following: 
1. All processing of these statistics should be 
performed on your Bank's computer, with the 
basic tape, any intermediate tape, or other 
media containing any version of data for indi-
vidual banks continually under the control of 
and in the physical custody of your Bank. 
2. All printed output from your computer or its 
peripheral equipment showing the results of such 
processing should be reviewed by a responsible 
person at your Bank. 
3. Appropriate personnel in your Bank should 
review the draft of the dissertation, includ-
ing all statistical tables, to assure nondisclosure 
therein of individual bank data. 
4 . The person directly responsible for the 
processing of the data should formally certify 
that no individual banking data were copied, or 
otherwise retained, and that knowledge of 

Mr. Roland D. Graham 
-2-
operations of individual banks developed as a 
product of the study will be held in strict 
confidence. 
If it is not feasible to do the actual processing at your 
Bank, equipment located off the premises may be used provided comparable 
data security arrangements are developed and observed. This would re-
" quire a responsible representative of your Bank to maintain physical 
•Custody of all tapes or other media used and to physically transport 
this material to the processing location each time it is used, to be 
actually present in the computer area while such work is being performed, 
and to insure that no copies of this material or related output, including 
intermediate tapes, are left at the processing site. Responsibility for 
review of output would be the same as if the processing occurred in-house. 
It is recognized that these conditions may place a prohibitive 
cost both on the researcher and on your Bank, particularly since it is 
understood that Mr. Schweitzer may be leaving the Minneapolis area. 
Should your Bank, however, decide to develop procedures to 
insure the maintenance of confidentiality (except to M r . Schweitzer) 
the reported information and you have any questions concerning the 
safeguards required for the use of these data, please get in touch 
with M r . Langham, Assistant Director of the Board's Division of Data 
Processing. 
If appropriate plans for safeguarding the confidentiality 
°f these data can be developed, the Board will be pleased to reconsider 
your request and to negotiate with the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation for authorization to use under such controlled conditions 
data reported by insured nonmember banks. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A . Kenyon 
Kenneth A . Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.

Item No. 2 
6/26/68 
ADDRESS OFFICIAL CQRRESPUNDENCE 
TO THE BDARD 
June 28, 1968. 
Dear Sir: 
The Board has reviewed the Reserve Banks' budgets for the 
last six months of this year and notes that expenditures are expected 
to be significantly higher than the current level, reflecting provi-
sion for 544 new employees. If these estimates prove reasonably 
accurate, Federal Reserve expenses for the year 1968 will show the 
largest increase (10.4 per cent) over the preceding year since the 
Korean War. 
As you know, the recent fiscal program approved by the 
Congress and supported by the Federal Reserve System included among 
It8 provisions a required reduction in Federal spending. The Board 
believes strongly that the System should conform to the spirit of 
thi s action. A review has just been completed of the Board's budget, 
and reductions totaling approximately $500,000 (3.7 per cent) of 
estimated annual expenses have been made. In addition, the Board has 
deferred work on the construction of its annex building until next 
year. 
In light of the above, the Board has accepted the budgets 
all of the Reserve Banks for the last half of 1968 subject to the 
understanding that each Bank will review its proposed expenditures to 
see where reductions can be made and that it will inform the Board as 
soon as possible of items proposed for deletion from the budget of 
each office as a result of such review. The Board suggests that 
°PP0rtunities for reductions exist, but are not limited to, the 
following areas: 
Staff Additions 
Expansion should be deferred unless such action 
would seriously hamper Federal Reserve programs or 
breach commitments already made. 

Travel Expense 
Limit trips to those that are essential and 
consider the possibility of deferring proposed in-
creases in travel reimbursement rates. 
Fees 
Review projects involving use of outside 
professional assistance for possible postponement. 
Furniture and Equipment - Purchases 
Consider deferment of purchases of autos and 
trucks, furnishings for executive quarters and 
other areas, typewriters, office machines, power 
files, computers, and other equipment. 
Repairs and Alterations 
Consider the possibility of deferring painting, 
cleaning, decorating, renovating, and other projects. 
(The above suggestions are not intended to apply to 
expenditures necessary to implement the coin separation program of 
the Treasury Department.) 
The Board also feels that, in general, outlays for building 
construction, fixed machinery and equipment, land acquisition, and the 
like should be delayed until the economic climate improves, although 
t recognizes that there may be extenuating circumstances in some 
oases that would make it desirable to proceed. In such instances, 
the Board should be advised, at the time specific approval is being 
requested, of the reasons for proceeding with the project. 
In addition to the reports of items to be deleted from the 
J^dgets,as mentioned earlier, the Board would like to have information 
snowing separately, for each six months, capital-type expenditures 
Planned for the periods July-December 1968 and January-June 1969 that 
you feel could be delayed to a later date. Please indicate by footnote 
otherwise any case where expenditures might be delayed from the last 
h a l f of 1968 to the first half of 1969 but not later without undue hardship. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.
