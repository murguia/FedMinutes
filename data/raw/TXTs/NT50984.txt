1. In light of their outlook for general economic 
activity, do Council members anticipate major 
changes in the public's demand for various types 
of bank and other credit over the months ahead? 
Are these changes expected to generate significant 
pressures on banks and on interest rates?

There is general agreement among the members of the Council 
that the current expansive thrust of business activity will persist over 
the months ahead. Accordingly, it is anticipated that the public's 
demand for various types of bank and other credit will increase. 
Consumer expenditures, as reflected by retail sales, continue 
strong as do borrowings to finance these purchases. Housing starts also 
are at a high level while permits for residential structures remain 
surprisingly strong. As a consequence, a relatively strong demand for 
mortgage funds seems assured. 
Industrial production reflects the rise in over-all demand with 
moderate inventory growth. The inventory-sales ratio continues to edge 
down, further strengthening the long-held expectation that additions to 
inventory are necessary to service the existing volumes of sales, not to 
mention a probable further increase in sales. This suggests a step up 
in business borrowing to finance larger working capital requirements. 
Capital spending appears to be strengthening, as evidenced by 
recent surveys of businessmen as well as by the behavior of new orders 
for durable and capital goods. This indicates a reasonably strong 
corporate demand for additional financing. 
The demand for funds by the Federal Government will remain strong 
in order to finance the continuing deficit in the budget. 
The accelerating tempo of business activity, including the demand 
for funds, is likely to generate pressures on banks and on the interest 
rate structure. However, the degree of pressure will depend not only on 
the demands for credit, but also upon the extent to which reserves are 
provided through monetary policy and upon the access banks have to the 
market for all types of funds. 
There was no further discussion of this topic. 
2. What are the Council's views on monetary and credit 
policy under present circumstances? 
The members of the Council continue apprehensive about the mag-
nitude of the deficit in the Federal budget and the inflationary pressures 
th is may generate. As a consequence, they are hopeful that the thrust of 
the policy, and the Budget Message in January, will clearly be addressed 
to this problem. Because of the probable size of the budget deficit, 
monetary and credit policy must be under more restraint than otherwise 

3163 
11/3/72 
-3-
might be appropriate. The members of the Council are heartened by the 
less expansive growth that has characterized several of the monetary 
aggregates in recent weeks. 
Governor Brimmer said that he had the impression that some 
moderation might be occurring in demands for funds in the household, 
State and local government, and business sectors. In particular, it 
would seem that revenue sharing might mean that State and local govern-
ments would have less need to borrow. He inquired whether Council 
members had observed any developments to bear out that impression. 
Responses included comments that the last few days had seen 
an easing in markets for State and municipal and Federal Government 
bonds. Also, accelerated depreciation and limitations imposed by the 
Committee on Interest and Dividends on dividend pay-outs had contributed 
to substantial improvement in corporate liquidity. In general, corpo-
rations had done better at improving their liquidity than had banks. 
Evidence of decreased market pressures was found in the fact that 
California savings and loan associations (but not banks) had eased 
their mortgage rates slightly in the last month. It was observed, 
however, that revenue sharing probably would not result in a reduction 
total borrowing; although State and local governments would have 
less need to borrow, the Federal Government might have to borrow more 
to provide the shared funds.

3. What are the views and recommendations of the 
Federal Advisory Council with regard to regula-
tions covering the permitted activities and 
processing procedures in the bank holding 
company field? 
Bank holding companies are seeking to establish financially 
congeneric businesses which will enable them to respond to changes 
in existing markets. 
To accomplish this goal, the businesses should be of sufficient 
scale to permit an allocation of financial resources and management 
talent to enable the holding company to provide the services needed in 
an effective manner. Secondly, the bank holding company should be 
Permitted to offer a sufficient range of services and facilities to 
enable customers to enjoy convenience and cost savings. 
The foregoing suggests the wisdom of a broadly defined, flexi-
ble list of permitted activities and conversely the undesirability of 
a precise listing of prohibited activities, i.e., a kind of "negative 
laundry list." 
In attempting to apply the above criteria to specific business 
areas, the present interpretations of the Federal Reserve Board regarding 
"activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks" 
Present a number of obstacles. Some of these occur in the following 
areas: 
(1) business information, (2) insurance, (3) consulting, (4) real 
estate development, (5) international activities, (6) leasing, (7) savings 
and loan associations. 
(Separate and apart from the Federal Reserve Board's regulation 
of the acquisition of savings and loan associations by bank holding compa-
nies, the members of the Council are concerned with the increasingly compet-
itive advantages given to these associations.) 
Several of the foregoing items are more fully discussed in a 
separate memorandum.1/ In addition, these items will be discussed 
orally by the members of the Council. 
With respect to processing procedures in the bank holding company 
field, the Council makes the following observations: 
1/ A copy of the memorandum is appended to these minutes. 

31G!j 
11/3/72 
-5-
(1) Congress specified that the 91-day period begins on the 
date of submission to the Board of the complete record on 
the application. This indefinite wording has made the 91-
day maximum period illusory. In order to accomplish the 
purpose of the Act, rules should be promulgated defining 
more precisely the commencement of the period. 
(2) In order to speed up the processing and determination of 
applications, perhaps more authority should be delegated 
to the Federal Reserve Banks with the necessary guide-
lines and, if necessary, by additions to the Board's staff. 
(3) Holding company applicants would much prefer to be able 
to pursue administrative remedies with the Board of 
Governors without the necessity of filing petitions for 
review in the United States Court of Appeals in order to 
preserve all of their legal rights. 
Mr. Bassett expressed the view that the Board had been too 
restrictive in its determination that "management consulting" was not 
an activity that was so closely related to banking as to be a proper 
incident thereto and therefore a bank holding company or one of its 
nonbank subsidiaries could not properly engage in such an activity. 
Council members regarded some of the services defined by the Board as 
"management consulting" as an integral part of traditional banking 
activities, and in particular they felt that a bank holding company 
should be permitted to use for the benefit of its customers information 
assembled for the bank holding company's own use in arriving at invest-
ment or credit decisions. A member of the Board observed that it seemed 
reasonable that a particular bank should be able to use information 
developed for in-house use for the benefit of its customers, but it 

3166 
11/3/72 
-6-
was difficult to draw a clear line restricting bank holding companies 
or their nonbank subsidiaries to providing management consulting services 
that were in turn limited to the utilization of information developed for 
the use of their subsidiary banks. Mr. Bassett said that a distinction 
might be made according to what banks generally did to assist customers. 
He noted that if a bank believed that a customer's unsatisfactory per-
formance was attributable to a poor marketing program, for example, it 
would urge that the customer seek help from a management consultant. He 
suggested that the line to determine where the use of in-house information 
stopped could be drawn at the point where outside specialists would 
ordinarily be required. 
President Clausen commented that an essential function of 
commercial bankers was to serve as consultants. Customers expected to 
get advice from their banks on a broad range of problems, such as 
bankruptcy, marketing, and inventories. Advice on such problems was 
provided to substantial customers even at times when they did not have 
any loans on the bank's books. Since a large portion of a bank lending 
officer's time was spent in consulting services, it seemed inconsistent 
that such an activity should be considered inappropriate for a bank 
holding company. 
Mr. Freeman spoke of a survey that had indicated that younger 
bank officers spent from 30 to 35 per cent of their time consulting with 

3167 
11/3/72 
-7-
customers on non-borrowing matters. Smaller companies, especially 
those located outside the center of the city, generally looked to 
their banker as their one knowledgeable source of advice, and they 
came to him with all sorts of problems. 
Mr, Barr referred to recent criticism of banks for carrying 
too large balances of charitable and nonprofit organizations in 
checking accounts, thus sacrificing the income that might have been 
obtained from the funds if they had been placed in interest-bearing 
accounts or investments. It was a custom for bank officers in some 
areas to serve on the boards of nonprofit institutions, with compen-
sation for that service in the form of balances. In his view, it 
might be more advantageous to such institutions if banks acted as 
their paid consultants. A trend in that direction might be found 
with respect to public utilities in Virginia, where the State legis-
lature had forbidden utilities to enter into any compensating balance 
arrangements. 
Other comments verified a trend toward charging for services 
rather than relying on compensating balances, the view being expressed 
that bank holding companies should be able to charge fees for the 
management consulting services their banks had provided in years past. 
Another theme of the discussion reflected the concern of the 
Council that a denial by the Board of an application to engage in a 

3168 
11/3/72 
-8-
certain activity was tantamount to denial for the industry as a whole. 
Suggestion was made that some means be found to leave open the possibi-
lity that, while an activity was not found to be permissible for a 
Particular applicant in a particular set of circumstances, that same 
activity might be found to be permissible in other circumstances or at 
another time. It was observed that in the 1970 amendments to the Bank 
Holding Company Act there had been an effort to choose new language 
that would avoid the associations and connotations of the old, and thus 
promote greater flexibility in the Federal Reserve's administration of 
the law. However, it appeared that in practice, denials of applications 
to engage in particular activities were causing reversion to the old 
rigidity. The Council recognized that it was a human tendency to stand 
by a decision even though circumstances might have changed, and that 
there should be known rules, but perhaps there could be a middle ground 
that would provide greater leeway for different responses according to 
different circumstances. As matters stood now, when it became known 
that the Board had denied an application to engage in a particular 
activity, other potential applicants for permission to engage in the 
same activity were inclined to believe that the position was set in 
concrete and that it would be futile to apply. 
Comments by members of the Board cited the confusion that 
would result if the industry did not know what rules the Board was 
following. It was emphasized that the Board's decisions were not 

3169 
11/3/72 
-9-
uinalterable and indeed that the Board stood ready to reconsider a 
position if there was evidence of the need to do so. It was noted 
that with respect to at least one activity-operation of savings and 
loan associations by bank holding companies--the Board had indicated 
that its negative position might be subject to change if the Congress 
should modify the role of savings and loans as institutions specializing 
in the mortgage field. Reference was made to the lack of readily 
available information in the past regarding the over-all negative posi-
tions the Board had taken. An effort had been made to correct that 
difficulty through publication in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for 
October 1972 of a list of activities that the Board had determined not 
to be closely related to banking. Inquiry was made whether the Council 
felt that such a listing was desirable. 
Ensuing comments by the Council indicated that the members did 
not object to the listing per se, but they felt that it would be desir-
able for the Board to avoid the implication that denial of an application 
to engage in a particular activity would apply for all time; a denial 
might be justified in 1972, but with many things changing in the economy, 
the same activity might reasonably be permitted in 1975. It was also 
mentioned that the October Bulletin listing of activities that the 
Board had determined were not closely related to banking contained a 
footnote to the effect that the question of operation of savings and 

31.70 
11/3/72 
-10-
loan associations "may be the subject of further consideration by the 
Board." it was easy to read into that an implication that the other 
activities listed were not subject to reconsideration. 
Further discussion indicated a view by some members of the 
Board that it should be possible to adopt a posture that would make 
it clear that the Board could reverse a decision with respect to a 
Particular activity in different circumstances. However, it was 
difficult to judge each case on an ad hoc approach, without parameters 
even on the negative side. It was emphasized that the world was chang-
ing rapidly and that the bank holding company field was a new area, 
in which the Board was feeling its way. There were uncertainties 
about the law in some respects, and the effects of decisions were 
sometimes unforeseen. It would be unwise for the Board to freeze its 
thinking and say that a certain determination should stand for all time; 
a change could be generated even within the Board itself with changes 
in its membership. On the other hand, frequent reversals of policy 
were not desirable. There was also a practical problem in the size 
°f the caseload, which could become unmanageable if no rules were 
Published. 
Mr. Freeman expressed the view that the four areas of insurance 
that the Board had specified as permissible were appropriate, but it 

3171 
11/3/72 
-11-
would be desirable that a little more latitude be allowed, partly 
because insurance was frequently part of a financing package. He 
spoke of an instance in which a bank holding company wanted to acquire 
a finance company, but when the negotiations were well advanced the 
finance company withdrew because it owned a small underwriting company 
and was fearful of the disclosure effect on its business if the Board 
should deny the acquisition because underwriting was not a permissible 
activity for a bank holding company. 
Even with respect to the insurance activities determined to be 
Permissible, Mr. Freeman continued, bank holding companies had experi-
enced considerable difficulty because their applications to engage in 
those activities de novo had been held in abeyance pending the Board's 
discussions with the National Association of Insurance Agents. There 
w a s some feeling among bank holding company applicants that the Board 
did not give them sufficient opportunity to make their views known. 
The discussion then turned to questions of procedure and Presi-
dent Clausen spoke of the cumbersomeness of having to negotiate through 
the Reserve Banks not only on the initial filing of an application but 
also on points subsequently raised by the Board's staff. Because of 
all the relays of information, it would seem that something might often 
be lost in the translation. Perhaps the process could be expedited if 
applicants had direct access to the Board. There also seemed to be 

3172 
11/3/72 
-12-
procedural shortcomings with respect to hearings. Before the Board 
declared an activity permissible, an opportunity for hearing was offered 
opponents. However, activities were often deemed to be impermissible 
for bank holding companies without offering applicants an opportunity 
for hearing. The latter situation was scarcely consistent with the 
expectation that the 1970 amendments would provide greater flexibility 
and permit a broader range of activities. 
Comments by members of the Board brought out that in some 
cases a hearing was required under the statute, while the Board could 
by regulation provide for hearings in other circumstances. Although 
it might be desirable to have hearings on many cases, and at one time 
a few members of the Board's Legal Division had argued that hearings 
were required on the great majority of cases, sheer physical limitations 
made that impossible. Nevertheless, the Board's staff was available 
to counsel with applicants, and frequently did so. The burden of the 
caseload was a compelling factor in the choice of procedures, aside 
from those specified in the law. Therefore, the use of the Federal 
Reserve Banks was an important tool, not only for negotiation regarding 
details of applications before they were brought to the Board for 
decision, but also for delegation of as many decisions as possible, 
within guidelines set by the Board. The prospect was that the scope 
of matters delegated to the Reserve Banks, to individual members of 

H/3/72 
-13-
the Board, and to the Board's staff would probably increase. This was 
an operating method that had been found necessary by other public bodies 
It was true that successful delegation required highly competent field 
units, and vigorous efforts were being made to bring the Reserve Bank 
staffs to the highest level of competence. 
Other comments included the observation that access to the 
board's staff was important to an applicant in order that those who 
would make recommendations to the Board would have a complete under-
standing of the circumstances underlying a proposal. After comments 
emphasizing the measures taken to facilitate conferring with the 
Board's staff, it was suggested that perhaps to some extent bank 
holding companies were foregoing an opportunity because they did not 
realize it was available to them. Discussion of the causes of proces-
sing delays, such as the need to obtain detailed information on banking 
markets, also included the observation that the better an application 
was documented, the less would be the need for supplementation. 
Further discussion dealt with the guidelines for exercise of 
authority delegated to the Reserve Banks. Mr. Bond cited an incident, 
admittedly an extreme, in which a relatively minor transaction had 
required a vast amount of paperwork. The Board requested a written 
description of the occurrence in order that corrective measures might 
be taken. 

317-
11/3/72 
-14-
Mr. Bond then spoke of the problem of real estate development 
under the Bank Holding Company Act. Although operation of mortgage 
companies had been determined to be permissible for bank holding 
companies, land development was not permissible. Traditionally, 
mortgage companies bought tracts of land, put in utilities and other 
facilities, and sold the lots to builders. Mortgage companies that 
were subsidiaries of bank holding companies were not permitted to 
engage in such development activities and therefore they were at a 
competitive disadvantage with companies that were not so owned. In 
response to an inquiry by a member of the Board whether the difficulty 
might be met by allowing bank holding company subsidiaries to engage 
in land development up to a modest percentage of their total business, 
Mr. Bond indicated that such leeway would be helpful. He added that 
the prohibition of activities in land development also hindered bank 
holding company subsidiaries from participating in urgently needed 
urban redevelopment projects. 
President Clausen commented on the importance of freedom for 
hank holding companies to compete in foreign countries according to 
the laws of the host country rather than according to more restrictive 
United States laws. At present, it was understood that bank holding 
companies were allowed no broader international activities than were 
Permitted for Edge corporations. There was additional inequity in 

317 
U/3/72 
-15-
that foreign bank holding companies that owned subsidiaries in the 
United States were permitted greater latitude than domestic institu-
tions. The Council would encourage as great a degree of flexibility 
a s possible for international operations of United States bank holding 
companies. Responding comments indicated that Governors Mitchell and 
Daane were now engaged in a study in this field and were expected to 
present their recommendations before long. The Board was concerned 
about the competitive posture of United States banks abroad and the 
activity of foreign banks in the United States. 
Mr. Dorrance spoke of the difficulty experienced by bank 
holding companies because they were permitted to engage in leasing 
°nly if full pay-out was provided. By contrast, a national bank, 
including one owned by a holding company, could engage in broader 
leasing activities under the rulings of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
Mr. English commented on developments relating to mutual savings 
hanks and savings and loan associations. He expressed the view that 
the problems in that area were much broader than the bank holding 
company context. In New England, especially, it was important that 
the evolution of mutual and stock thrift institutions into near-counter-
Parts of commercial banks be orderly and equitable. A wide range of 
related problems included an effective way for banks to compete in 
the mortgage market, and disparities between the thrift institutions 

31 
U/3/72 
-16-
and banks with respect to tax status, interest rate ceilings, and 
reserve requirements. For small banks, especially, the broadening 
powers of thrift institutions, without accompanying commensurate 
responsibilities, posed a serious competitive threat. Another 
important aspect of the problem was the dilution of control over 
the money supply with the increasing ability of mutual savings banks 
and savings and loan associations to offer what amounted to demand 
deposit services. While it was recognized that the Hunt Commission 
had made constructive proposals for the phasing-in of thrift institu-
tions into the payments mechanism, events were outrunning the 
development of legislative remedies. New England banks were anxious 
to have the problem resolved at the national level. He suggested 
that the question be placed on an agenda for an early meeting of the 
Council with the Board for full discussion. 
President Clausen mentioned developments on the West Coast 
illustrating the pressure being exerted by savings and loan associa-
tions to participate in the SCOPE money transfer mechanism, and 
expressed the view that the Federal Reserve was probably the only 
agency through which equity for banks might be accomplished. 
4. What are the views of the Council with regard to 
developments in bank liquidity and the funding 
problems faced by banks in the period ahead as 
it relates to Federal Reserve policy, including 
the degree of dependence on Federal Reserve 
credit that might be anticipated in periods of 
strong credit restraint? 

3177 
11/3/72 
-17-
In appraising bank's liquid asset positions and the adequacy 
of their access to resources, two general propositions should be noted 
at the outset. First, the demand deposit sector has long been declin-
ing as a percentage of total liabilities. The trend has been a good 
deal more pronounced for the large banks than for the others. As the 
Proportion of interest-bearing funds rises, so does the magnitude of 
liquidity problems facing banks in the event market interest rates 
rise above any ceilings banks are permitted to pay for these funds. 
This kind of problem is independent of pressures on liquidity arising 
from greater demands for credit. 
Second, over-all liquidity encompasses both actual liquid asset 
holdings and the access to funds afforded by the ability to sell instru-
ments in the money market. The latter is more critical to large banks 
than the former. This access is a function of the market's willingness 
to absorb new liabilities and the willingness of the Federal Reserve to 
accommodate such activity. 
The main conclusion about bank funding is that purchased (or 
money market) funds are likely to constitute the largest single source 
of funds for credit expansion. There has been a strong long-term trend 
in the growing reliance on money market financing by banks, and this 
reliance is expected to increase further in the foreseeable future. The 
liquid asset positions of banks have improved over the past two years 
but cutbacks on the holdings of such assets to support loan expansion 
could furnish only a fraction of the total needed. 
In the area of policy, as purchased funds in the banking system 
continue to enlarge, interest rate ceilings employed for control purposes 
will become increasingly difficult to manage without fostering serious 
financial instability. 
Ceilings on rates paid on large CD's have at least three basic 
defects as a control measure. They are not effective in materially 
impeding the over-all growth of credit; they foster distortions and 
destabilizing developments in financial markets; and in some cases they 
are likely to spur borrowing at a time when the deceleration of credit 
growth is the aim of monetary policy. 
Although the need for restraint measures in the future cannot 
b e foretold with certainty, general instruments of policy-open market 
operations, reserve requirements, and the discount rate—should be 
employed instead of Regulation Q ceilings to carry out the goals of 
Policy. 

3178 
11/3/72

Couelusion 
The increasing participation of the banks in the money market 
has resulted in a more viable competitive system. The market place has 
been permitted to play a more prominent role with prices (i.e., interest 
rates), assuming a more dominant function as an allocator of resources. 
This has been the result of a fundamental but constructive shift in the 
attitude of the monetary and regulatory authorities to which commercial 
bankers have responded aggressively. 
This change has dictated a re-examination and reappraisal of 
standards, techniques, policies and procedures. 
The experience of the past decade strongly suggests the pursuit 
°f the following policies: 
1. The commercial banks should continue to have access to 
the money markets. Only in this manner will the com-
petitiveness introduced into the system be retained 
with the market place and prices playing a dominant 
role. The monetary authorities accordingly would 
rely on controlling (a) the level of required reserves 
and (b) the volume of available reserves to effect 
their policy decisions. 
2. Commercial banks must be assured of access to the dis-
count window to meet emergency needs, including those 
resulting from shrinkages of deposits (or other liabili-
ties) or lack of access to other sources of funds. We 
recognize that for continued use of the discount window, 
the Federal Rfeserve may impose certain disciplines on 
the banks involved. 
In response to a question whether there was any doubt among 
bankers that the discount window would be available to meet emergency 
needs, President Clausen said he thought there was always some fear 
that access to the window might be constrained. He also noted that 
the use of the window was attended by limiting factors such as archaic 
rules for eligibility of collateral and the expectation that resort to 

3179 
11/3/72 
-19-
the window would be of relatively short duration. Perhaps it would 
helpful if, instead of cutting off access to the window, Federal 
Reserve credit were to be rationed by charging a higher rate on overly-
large and/or extended borrowings. It was recognized that such a differ-
ential rate would require a change in the law. 
It was noted that absolute assurance of access to the discount 
window might tie the hands of the Federal Reserve in its conduct of 
monetary policy and, from the point of view of banks, complete confi-
dence that the Federal Reserve would bail them out even if they made 
serious mistakes might tempt them to make commitments beyond the line 
of prudence. It was observed that, with commitments now at a high 
level and rising, banks might find themselves in grave difficulty if 
they had to buy money to meet a sizable portion of those commitments. 
President Clausen noted that the Council's statement did not 
imply that the commercial banking system would abrogate its responsi-
bility to watch over its flow of funds and liquidity. 
Mr. Freeman expressed the view that banks generally could not 
meet their potential liquidity requirements from their own assets; 
they were borrowing short and lending long. A generation ago, bankers 
had still felt that they should provide their own liquidity, but partly 
as a result of legislative changes dating back to the mid-thirties 
banks began to sell term loans, with maturities of one-to-five or 

3180 
11/3/72 
-20-
one-to-ten years. In the last decade, such loans were looming larger 
a s a proportion of bank assets, and he felt bankers increasingly expected 
to look to the Federal Reserve for liquidity if they should lack other 
sources of funds. 
A member of the Board inquired how bankers would feel about 
control of bank commitments through regulatory authority. Most bankers 
were competent and conscientious, and would look to the future and 
make responsible decisions, but here and there, as had happened in the 
Past, a big banker might fail to use good judgment. If the Federal 
Reserve accepted the premise that it would bail banks out of their 
difficulties, banks tacitly accepted a responsibility to watch their 
commitments. The question was whether they would watch them carefully 
enough if left to themselves, or whether the Federal Reserve needed to 
draw regulations for added assurance that sufficient prudence was being 
exercised. This idea was being offered as a question, to which the 
answer was not known. Yet it seemed apparent that some discussion would 
b e in order about the problem that would arise if the Federal Reserve 
stood ready to underwrite all of the mistakes of banks, thus abrogating 
to the banks its authority to control Federal Reserve credit and thus 
monetary policy. 
President Clausen expressed the view that the banking industry 
a s a whole did watch commitments and also tracked utilization under 

3181 
11/3/72 
-21-
commitments, which was a good index. He did not know of any abuses 
which had led banks into serious difficulties because of over-commit-
ments. The industry had an outstanding record for good management, 
and all of its operations, including commitments, were subject to 
examination by bank supervisory authorities. 
Further comments by a Board member assented that bank examina-
tions might be the tool through which bank commitments could be moni-
tored. The Council members were requested to give the Board any 
thoughts they had on the subject. 
Other parts of the discussion dealt with the question of erosion 
of membership in the System, especially from the point of view of 
diminishing the base upon which monetary policy could be exerted. It 
was brought out that in a number of instances correspondent banks 
had assured other banks that were considering withdrawing from the 
System that if they would place their balances with the correspondents, 
the latter would take care of their problems. However, it was mentioned 
also that the Federal Reserve Regional Check Processing Centers were 
Providing an element of competition that correspondent banks found 
troublesome. The Board requested that Council members furnish their 
views at a later meeting regarding the membership problem and methods 
of dealing with it.

be packaged in any form and made available to users for whatever purpose 
they may wish to acquire the information. We believe that such interpre-
tation should not conflict with the prohibition against management 
consulting which, as defined by the Board, involves, as a basic ingredient, 
either analysis or furnishing of advice and is, therefore, to be distinguished 
from the furnishing of the data or information to be analyzed or on which 
advice is to be based. 
Insurance 
In order to offer effectively and economically loan services to 
consumers in the retail area, including mortgage lending, personal loans, 
etc., banks will be required to make available various types of insurance. 
Insurance is frequently an integral part of the loan package and, unless 
a lender can offer the total package, profitability, customer costs and 
convenience and ability to meet the competition of other retail lenders 
»ho can offer total packages will suffer. The Federal Reserve Board has 
defined insurance activities permissible in bank holding company lending 
°Perations. (Interpretations paragraph 225.128.) These include (1) insur-
ar*ce that supports the lending operation (such as credit life and credit 
accident and health insurance); insurance that protects the collateral 
i n which the bank holding company has an interest; insurance that is part 
o f an insurance package as a general practice, such as liability insurance 
Sol<* in conjunction with an automobile loan or homeowner's insurance sold 
l n conjunction with a mortgage to the lender; (2) renewal insurance sold 
a s a convenience to a purchaser so long as the total premiums are not a 
significant portion of total insurance premiums; (3) insurance protecting 
collateral for purchased loans provided the security interests are pur-
chased on a continuing basis; (4) insurance in connection with bank 
related services such as loss of securities or other valuables in safe-
keep ing and in connection with mortgage servicing but the insurance on 
the mortgagor may not exceed the outstanding balance of the loan. 
Although the Federal Reserve Board has determined that such 
actlvities are permissible for a bank holding company, it is to be noted 
th*t when several mortgage subsidiaries of bank holding companies recently 
aPplled to provide such insurance as de novo activity the Board suspended 
t h e right to enter the field pending its decision on objections filed by 
the National Insurance Association and the decision is still pending. 
Assuming the Board will permit bank holding c o m p a n i e s to engage 
^ insurance agency activities as prescribed in Regulation Y and the 
Board's Interpretations, a number of issues remain: 
1. Competitors of bank holding companies in mortgage 
lending and consumer finance offer insurance as a 
part of the loan package and it is believed that 
insurance commissions received have a significant 
bearing on their profitability and the cost of their 
services.

2. Customer convenience and protection would be 
enhanced if bank holding companies could pro-
vide not only credit life and disability insurance, 
but also term insurance in relation to loans. 
3. As a matter of customer convenience and profitability 
to the lender, renewal insurance is a significant 
factor even though the loan has been repaid. 
It seems to be clear that the insurance area requires additional 
consideration in order to accomplish: customer convenience and protection, 
cost saving, profitability and ability to compete without impairing the 
capacity of independent insurance agents and brokers to conduct their 
business, 
Consulting 
The Board has ruled that "management consulting" is not within 
the scope of activities to be conducted by bank holding companies and has 
defined the term very broadly. However, there are specialized areas in 
which bank holding companies are particularly fitted to supply needed 
services and which do not involve the broad spectrum of management consul-
tants. such specialized areas would include urban and new city development, 
cash management, financial planning and analysis for governmental units, 
businesses, charitable institutions and foundations, etc. It is believed 
Jhat these specialized activities under the bank holding company should 
b e Permitted and that this could be accomplished in a manner that would 
n°t place bank holding companies in a position to exercise undue influence 
°n customers of their bank affiliates. 
^ L Estate Development 
. 
In view of the financial role the banking industry must play 
l n helping to satisfy the housing needs of the nation, bank holding 
companies through their mortgage banking affiliates should be permitted 
t 0 take equity positions in real estate projects. Mortgage banking 
filiates of bank holding companies are now more restricted than their 
competitors which are not so affiliated. Urban renewal and new city 
Projects involve more than housing for medium and low income groups — 
they involve inner cities and new cities with schools, churches, play-
bounds and sufficient industrial, commercial and higher valued private 
Properties to provide an adequate tax base. Since banks seek to serve 
th® total population and range of commercial and business activity they 
have an incentive to innovate and to participate in community developments 
and business growth. Bank holding companies should be permitted to play 
a niore creative role in bringing to fruition socially desirable projects. 
T he experience of banks in lending in economically deprived areas demon-
states the need for leadership in the private sector and for direct

Participation in all phases of community development from equity partic-
4pation to financial counseling of small businesses, new business 
Gnterprises and home purchasers. 
£°Hchjsion 
In the principal business areas in which a bank holding 
company is permitted to operate, it should be able to offer all facilities 
and services necessary to enable it to meet the needs and convenience of 
t s customers, to meet competition and to earn such return on its invest-
ment as will permit it to be a vital factor in its field. For example, 
in the real estate area, the development of new cities and inner cities 
urban redevelopment required to meet present day population demands 
involve more than traditional bank-type financing. A bank holding company, 
hrough its mortgage banking affiliates, should have the legal capacity 
0 offer not only traditional financing and insurance agency services 
Related thereto, but also to participate in land acquisition and rehabili-
ation, municipal planning and building design, feasibility studies, 
inancial planning, appraisal and counseling on civic development. Broadly 
ased service capability in other areas determined to be closely related 
0 banking is also necessary to promote viability and vigorous competition 
ln meeting public needs.
