The Board began its consideration of the proposed Board 
capability budget for the year 1971, which amounted to $24,164,000. 
The major part of today's meeting was devoted to a presentation 
by Mr. Halley, who endeavored to put the problem in focus by describing 
"where we have been, where we are now, and where we expect to be next 
year." 
At the conclusion of Mr. Halley's presentation, the Chairman 
suggested that tomorrow the Board address itself to consideration of 
what would be involved in reducing the proposed capability budget by 
approximately $1 million. He suggested materials that might be helpful 
to the Board in analyzing the problem and in determining the feasibility 
of reducing the budget to a greater extent than the figure he had mentioned. 
The meeting then adjourned.
