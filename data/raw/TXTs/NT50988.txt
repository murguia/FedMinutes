of the Board, in instances where preliminary circulation of the draft

rization for the Bank to enter into a construction contract, subject to 
approval by the Bank's Board of Directors. A draft letter in that form 
was attached.

During discussion concern was expressed with respect to amounts 
being spent by the System on building projects, and that those expenses 
that might be deemed extravagant could possibly result in undesirable 
repercussions. 
It was also suggested that the System should seek to 
insure that its standards for building construction were generally conso-
nant with governmental guidelines. 
After further discussion the Board unanimously approved the letter 
to the Boston Bank. A copy of the letter is attached under Item No. 10, 
along with a copy of a supplemental letter sent to the Bank. 
It was understood that staff would inquire into certain costs 
associated with System building construction, particularly in the area of 
a^t work, with a view toward the development of cost guidelines in those 
areas, and that in future construction projects continued emphasis should 
be placed on the functional aspects of the structure. 
Ninety-one-day provision. With a memorandum dated November 13, 1972, 
Messrs. Coyne, O'Connell, and Greenspan submitted a proposed reply to a 
request by the Association of Registered Bank Holding Companies for a 
statement of policy with respect to the statutory time limit requirements 
Pertaining to applications filed under sections 3 and 4(c)(8) of the Bank 
Holding Company Act. 
The Board unanimously approved the letter, with the understanding 
that staff would coordinate with the Association to insure that the contents

meeting at this point. 
Office space. The Board unanimously approved a recommendation 
by Governor Sheehan in a memorandum dated November 10, 1972, that the 
Division of Administrative Services be given approval to commit approxi-
mately $75,000 per annum to lease additional space in the Watergate 600 
building for a period of at least two years beginning January 1, 1973. 
Officers' salaries. In a memorandum dated November 13, 1972, 
Chairman Burns proposed that the Board delegate to the Board member in 
charge of internal administrative policies the authority to approve in-
creases of not more than $2,000 per annum in the salaries of individual 
officers of the Board when circumstances warranted such action at times 
during the year other than at the Board's annual review of officers' 
salaries. 
The Board unanimously approved the proposal, with the understanding 
that the authority would not extend to increases that would raise a staff 
member's salary to a level in excess of the salary paid to a member of the 
Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.

STATEMENT 
American Bancorporation, Los Angeles, California, has applied 
f°r the Board's approval under § 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding company 
through acquisition of 50 per cent, plus one share, of the outstanding 
voting shares of Ranchers Bank, Quartz Hill, California. 
Statutory considerations. - Applicant is a nonoperating cor-
poration formed for the express purpose of acquiring Ranchers Bank which 
has aggregate deposits of approximately $7 million. Since Applicant has 
n° present operations or subsidiaries, consummation of the proposal 
w°uld not adversely affect existing or potential competition, nor have 
any adverse effect on any bank in the area. 
Applicant filed this application to become a bank holding 
°ompany through acquisition of shares of stock of Ranchers Bank on June 1, 
l9?2. Officers and directors of Ranchers Bank have opposed the action 
o f Applicant, and in fact have a pending merger agreement with 
California Republic Bank, Bakersfield, California. The management and 
stockholders of both banks have approved this latter merger proposal 
Presently under review by State and Federal supervisory authorities. 
Applicant's financial plans are based upon cash commitments 
f°r a total of $450 thousand in order to achieve control of Ranchers 
Bank. Servicing of this debt is dependent upon projected improvements in 
earnings of Ranchers Bank. In addition, Applicant's projected income 
deludes an annual management fee of $18 thousand. This management fee 
w°uld amount to approximately 49.5 per cent of Ranchers Bank's 1971 net 

32AG 
income, and would be applied to the servicing of Applicant's acquisition 
debt, since Applicant would control only 50 per cent, plus one share, of 
outstanding shares of Ranchers Bank, this management fee appears to be 
^justified in that it would be applied to the servicing of Applicant's 
Acquisition debt at the expense of Ranchers Bank's minority shareholders. 
Comments and views on the proposal were solicited from the 
State Banking Department for the State of California, The California 
Superintendent of Banks concluded that the acquisition would not be in 
^ e best interests of Ranchers Bank's depositors and shareholders, nor 
^ the public interest. Applicant was granted an extension of time in 
which to reply to the Superintendent's comments, and its own views have 
also been considered in the Board's determination of this case. 
The Board believes that a holding company should be a source 
o f financial and managerial strength for the banks in its system and 
fchat every proposed acquisition should be closely examined to determine 
whether it serves certain private interests to the undue disadvantage of 
t he interests of the bank or its shareholders. The Board carefully 
scrutinizes all proposals involving bare majority of a bank's shares 
since contending factions within bank may contribute adversely to the 
bank's future welfare. In this regard, the Board concludes that con-
siderations relating to the financial and management factors weigh 
a8ainst approval of Applicant's proposal. 
The convenience and needs of the communities to be served are 
alfeady adequately being served and there is no evidence that approval 
o f the instant proposal would give rise to any significant public benefits. 

3247 
-3-
On the contrary, in order to service Applicant's substantial acquisition 
debt, additional stress might be placed on the resources of Ranchers 
fiank. Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the com-
munities to be served lend no weight towards approval of the application. 
Under all the circumstances of this case, the Board concludes 
that the leverage contemplated, the unfair treatment of minority share-
holders, and the managerial resources of Applicant present adverse 
circumstances weighing against approval. These circumstances are not 
outweighed by any pro-competitive factors or by considerations relating 
the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Accord-
ingly, approval of this application is not in the public interest and 
it should be denied.

FEDERAL RESrifcVfi SYSTEM 
FIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First Financial Corporation, Tampa, Florida, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has ap-
plied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(a)(3)) to acquire not less than 90 per cent of the voting shares 
°f First Financial National Bank of Tampa, Tampa, Florida ("Bank"), 
a proposed new bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for inter-
ested persons to submit comments and views, has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and 
views has expired, and none has been timely received. The Board has 
considered the application in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls 10 banks with aggregate deposits of $555 
Million, representing 3.4 per cent of the total commercial bank 
dePosits in the State, and is the sixth largest banking organization 
ai*d bank holding company in Florida. 
(All banking data are as of 
December 31, 1971, unless otherwise noted, adjusted to reflect all 
bank holding company acquisitions and formations approved by the 
Board through October 31, 1972.) Since Bank is a proposed new bank, 
no existing competition would be eliminated nor would concentration 
increased in any relevant area. 

-2-
3249 
Bank would be located in a fast growing area north of Tampa, 
with an estimated population of 55,000, and would be competing in the 
Tampa banking market, in which Applicant controls 32.9 per cent of 
deposits, Applicant presently operates three subsidiary banks in the 
Tanipa banking market, the closest being Applicant's lead bank, The 
first National Bank of Tampa, located about 9 miles south of the pro-
Posed site of Bank. The ninth and seventh largest banking organizations 
Florida rank second and third in the Tampa banking market and con-
trol 25.0 and 13.5 per cent, respectively, of market deposits. 
Subsidiaries of five other bank holding companies also compete in the 
Tampa market, four of which are among the State's ten largest banking 
organizations. Additionally, there are numerous intervening banks. 
*t appears that consummation of the proposal herein would not alter 
adversely the competitive situation nor the concentration of resources 
i n the market, nor is there any evidence in the record that Applicant's 
Proposal is an attempt to pre-empt a site before there is a need for 
a bank. 
The financial and managerial resources and the future pros-
Pacts of Applicant and its subsidiaries are regarded as generally 
Satisfactory. 
Prospects for Bank appear favorable since it would have 
CaPable and experienced management and would be adequately capitalized. 
Bank would be able to provide an additional source of full banking 
8ervices in an area which is experiencing rapid growth. Considerations 

3250 
-3-
relating to the convenience and needs of the area to be served lend slight 
support to, and are consistent with, approval of the application. It is 
fche Board's judgment that the proposed acquisition would be in the public 
interest and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this 
°rder, and (c) First Financial National Bank of Tampa, Tampa, Florida, 
shall be opened for business not later than six months after the effec-
tive date of this Order. Each of the periods described in (b) and (c) 
^ay be extended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve 
&ank of Atlanta pursuant to delegated authority.

11/14/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
NORTHWEST KANSAS INSURANCE AGENCY, INC. 
Order Approving Merger of Bank Holding Companies 
and Acquisition through Merger of Insurance Agency 
Northwest Kansas Insurance Agency, Inc., Colby, Kansas, has 
aPplied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(5) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(5)) to merge bank holding companies and, 
thereby, to acquire 41.5 per cent or more additional voting shares of 
Thomas County National Bank, Colby, Kansas ("Bank"). 
The proposed acquisition of Bank is to be accomplished by 
means of a statutory merger of Applicant with the Ki-Plains Insurance 
ASency, Inc., Colby, Kansas, a bank holding company under common control 
vith Applicant. The application to acquire Eank, therefore, is under 
th(* jurisdiction of section 3(a)(5) of the Act, which provision requires 
the Board's prior approval "for any bank holding company to merge or 
°°nsolidate with any other bank holding company." The Board has considered 
this application on that basis. 
At the same time Applicant has applied for the Board's approval 
Under § 4(c)(8) of the Act and § 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y 
t o engage in insurance agency activities through the acquisition, by merger, 
o f the insurance agency business formerly conducted by the Hi-Plains 
d u r a n c e Agency, Inc. ("Hi-Plains Agency"), to be named The Thomas County 
I nsu r a n c e Agency, Inc., each of Colby, Kansas. 
Notice of receipt of the applications has been given in accordance 
with §§ 3 a nd 4 of the Act (37 Federal Register 21017), and the time for 

3
<r>

-
filing comments and views has expired. The Board has considered the appli-
cations in the light of the facts set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
l842(c)), and the considerations specified in § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 
U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and finds that: 
Applicant is a one-bank holding company by virtue of its ownership 
41 per cent of the outstanding voting shares of Bank; and the Hi-Plains 
^surance Agency, Inc. ("Hi-Plains"), is a one-bank holding company by 
virtue of its ownership of 41.5 per cent of Bank. In addition, Applicant 
and Hi-Plains each own and operate a general insurance agency on the premises 
Bank. Through these applications, Applicant proposes to acquire 41.5 per 
cent additional voting shares of Bank and succeed to the insurance agency 
business formerly conducted by Hi-Plains. Applicant would accomplish this 
restructuring of corporate ownership of Bank and Hi-Plains Agency by merging 
Hi-Plains into Applicant. Accordingly, no significant issues are presented 
by these applications. 
1/ 
Bank, with deposits of $11.5 million, 
is the smaller of two 
commercial banks in Colby, Kansas. Upon approval of this application, 
Applicant would own 82.5 per cent of Bank's voting shares. No existing 
° r Potential competition would be eliminated upon consummation of this 
Proposal. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, Bank, and 
^-Plains Agency are considered sound, and the future prospects of the 
respective organizations appear favorable. Consolidation of the structure 
under which Bank and Hi-Plains Agency operate could improve the internal 
A/ Banking data are as of June 30, 1972.

°Perating efficiency of the respective organizations. It appears that 
c°nsummation of Applicant's proposal would not have any immediate effects 
0 n the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Applicant, 
w°uld, however, be more able, through increased resources, to offer expanded 
services to the community as such needs arise. Considerations relating to 
convenience and needs of the communities to be served are, therefore, 
insistent with approval of the applications. It is the Board's judgment 
that the proposed transaction is consistent with the public interest and 
should be approved. 
Applicant and Hi-Plains each currently operate separate general 
insurance agencies on Bank's premises. Applicant would acquire the insurance 
business formerly conducted by Hi-Plains Agency through its proposed acqui-
sition by merger of Hi-Plains. Both Agencies compete with seven other 
insurance agencies in Colby, Kansas, and Hi-Plains Agency engages in a 
general insurance agency business. Hi-Plains Agency sells life, credit life, 
fire, casualty, crop-hail insurance, and short term grain fire insurance. 
Colby, Kansas, is a town of approximately 4,700; acting as a 
General insurance agent or broker in a community of less than 5,000 people 
an activity that the Board has previously determined by regulation to 
b e closely related to banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)). No existing or poten-
tial competition would be eliminated upon consummation of this proposal, 
since it represents only a restructuring of corporate ownership. 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that consummation 
o f the proposal would result in any undue concentration of resources, unfair 
c°mpetition, confiicts of interests, unsound banking practices, or other 

3251 
Averse effects on the public interest. Based upon the foregoing and other 
considerations reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the 
balance of the public interest factors that the Board is required to con-
sider regarding the acquisition of Hi-Plains Agency under § 4(c)(8) is 
favorable and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications to acquire Bank 
a n d Agency are approved for the reasons summarized above. The acquisition 
o f Bank shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day 
f°Uowing the effective date of this Order or (b) later than three months 
after the effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended 
f o r good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 
Pu*suant to delegated authority. The determination as to Agency's activi-
tie 
s is subject to the Board's authority to require reports by, and make 
examinations of, holding companies and their subsidiaries and to require 
S u ch modification or termination of the activities of a holding company or 
atly of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary to assure compliance 
with cne provisions and purposes of the Act and the Board's regulations 
and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent evasion thereof.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
NBC CO. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Mutual Savings Company 
NBC Co., Lincoln, Nebraska, a bank holding company 
within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
for the Board's approval, under section 4(c)(8) of the Act and 
§ 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y, to acquire all of 
the voting shares of Mutual Savings Company, Lincoln, Nebraska 
("Mutual"), a company that engages in the operation of an 
industrial loan company in the manner authorized by Nebraska 
law and neither accepts demand deposits nor makes commercial 
loans. Such activity has been determined by the Board to be 
closely related to banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(2)). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity 
for interested persons to submit comments and views on the 
Public interest factors, has been duly published (37 Federal 
Register 15347). The time for filing comments and views has 
expired, and none has been timely received. 
Applicant's banking subsidiary, National Bank of 
Commerce Trust and Savings Association ("Bank"), is the second 
largest of the eleven banks located in Lincoln, Nebraska, and 
held deposits of $158.6 million, as of December 31, 1971. 
Mutual issues "certificates of indebtedness" and with funds 
derived thereby, makes small personal loans secured primarily 
by automobiles, household goods, and second mortgages on real 

39 crc 
/ C O O 
- 2 -
estate. IJith total assets of $786,000, Mutual operates out of 
a single office in Lincoln, Nebraska, and is the smallest of 
the three industrial loan companies in Lincoln. 
The proposed transaction would have no significant 
adverse effect on existing competition in the market for 
lendable funds. Whereas Bank offers the usual range of deposit 
services offered by commercial banks, Mutual offers "certificates 
°f indebtedness" which, though similar to certificates of deposit, 
represent a higher risk, due to their uninsured character, than 
d o deposits received by Bank. This is reflected in higher 
interest rates paid by Mutual on such funds, than are paid by 
Bank for its deposit liabilities and by the fact that a substantial 
P°rtion of the holders of Mutual's "certificates of indebtedness" 
also maintain savings deposits at insured institutions. Barriers 
entry into the banking business and legal requirements that 
Bank, as a national bank, maintain the insured character of its 
dePosits 
and comply with limitations upon the payment of interest 
° n deposits established by the Board's Regulation Q (12 CFR 217) 
Su8gest 
that future significant development of competition between 
Mutual and Bank in the market for such lendable funds is unlikely. 
The major portion of Mutual!s loan portfolio is secured by second 
m°rtgages

Action 24 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371) from 
taking loans in primary reliance on a second mortgage on real

estate as security. However, some slight competition may 
exist between Mutual and Dank in the making of other consumer 
l°ans. Nevertheless, consummation of the proposed transaction 
would have only an insignificant adverse effect upon competition 
in the Lincoln consumer loan market in view of Mutual1s rela-
tively slight position in that market. 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that 
consummation of the proposed transaction would result in any 
undue concentration of resources, unfair competition, unsound 
hanking practices, or other adverse effects on the public 
interest. It is anticipated that Mutual's affiliation with 
Applicant will strengthen Mutual1s ability to compete vis a vis 
the two other industrial loan companies in Lincoln, both of 
V7hich are substantially larger than Mutual. To the extent 
fchat consummation of the proposed transaction will strengthen 
Mutual as a competitive alternative in Lincoln and enable 
Mutual to accommodate certain borrowers which Mutual is 
Presently unable to serve, public benefits would derive from 
c°nsummation of the transaction. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations 
reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the 
balance of the public interest factors the Board is required 
t o consider under section 4(c)(8) is favorable. Accordingly, 

3258

the application is hereby approved. This determination is 
subject to the conditions set forth in section 225.4(c) 
Regulation Y and to the Board's authority to require 
s^ch modification or termination of the activities of a 
holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds 
necessary to assure compliance with the provisions and purposes 
o f the Act and the Board's regulations and orders issued there-
under, or to prevent evasion thereof. 
By order of the Board of Governors,V effective November 14, 1972.

Item No. 7 
11/14/72 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
NORTHERN STATES FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
TWIN GATES CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Northern States Financial Corporation, Detroit, Michigan 
( Northern States"), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank 
Elding Company Act, and Twin Gates Corporation, Wilmington, Delaware ("Twin 
Gates"), a registered bank holding company owning directly 22.48 per cent of 
the voting shares of Northern S t a t e s h a v e applied for the Board's approval 
under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. § 1842(a)(3)) to acquire all of the 
v°ting shares of the successor by merger to Bank of Lansing, Lansing, 
Michigan ("Bank'') . The applications state that the acquisition will be made 
directly by Northern States. The bank into which Bank is to be merged has 
n° significance except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of all the 
V°ting shares of Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of shares 
the successor organization is treated herein as the proposed acquisition 
o f the shares of Bank. 
^ 
In addition, ten separate trusts established for the benefit of the 
shareholders of Twin Gates hold an additional 15.8 per cent of the voting 
shares of Northern States. Control of said shares is attributed to Twin 
afces by virtue of § 2(g)(2) of the Act. Twin Gates and Northern States 
c°^trol indirectly, as a result of the profit sharing trust of the banking 
Subsidiary of Northern States, 13.2 per cent of the voting shares of National 
T ^ k of Rochester, Rochester, Michigan ("Rochester Bank"). Twin Gates also 
directly owns an additional 20 per cent of the voting shares of Rochester 
a nk, which is thus deemed to be a subsidiary of Twin Gates. 

3260 
-2-
Notice of the applications, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
the Board has considered the applications and all comments received in light 
the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)). 
Northern States is the seventh largest banking organization in 
Michigan, and controls one bank, City National Bank of Detroit, Detroit, 
Michigan ("City National), with total deposits of $529.2 million, 
^presenting 2.3 per cent of total commercial bank deposits in the State. 
(Unless otherwise indicated, banking data are as of December 31, 1971, * 
adjusted to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved by 
^ e Board through October 31, 1972.) Upon acquisition of Bank ($130 million 
deposits), Northern States' share of deposits would increase by 0.6 per cent, 
and Northern States would become the sixth largest banking organization in 
Michigan. 
Bank, which operates seven offices in the City of Lansing and 
environs, holds 17.3 per cent of the total commercial bank deposits in the 
Lansing market, and is the third largest bank in the market. The two 
larger banks in the market hold, respectively, 38.3 per cent and 20.5 per 
cent of the deposits in the market. 
(Market data are as of June 30, 1970.) 
*t does not appear that any significant existing competition between Bank 
a nd the subsidiaries of Northern States and Twin Gates would be eliminated 

3261 
-3-
as a result of consummation of the proposal. The nearest banking office 
°f City National or Rochester Bank is located 58 miles east of an office of 
Bank. Furthermore, in view of the distances involved, the large number of 
banking alternatives available, and the restrictions placed on branching by 
Michigan laws, it appears unlikely that any significant competition between 
the banking institutions would develop in the future. 
While Northern States possesses the resources to enter the market 
novo or through acquisition of a smaller bank, the elimination of such 
Potential competition does not appear to be significantly adverse in view 
o f the fact that Bank does not occupy a dominant position in the market. 
the basis of the foregoing and the facts of record, the Board concludes 
that consummation of the proposal would not eliminate significant existing 
competition nor foreclose the development of significant potential competition. 
In view of plans to improve the capital position of City National 
2/ 
Bank,"" it appears that Northern States and its subsidiary bank are in 
generally satisfactory financial condition; their managements are capable, 
at*<l prospects for each appear favorable. The financial and managerial 
resources of Twin Gates appear satisfactory, and its prospects are considered 
favorable. In reviewing the financial condition and prospects of Bank, the 
27~~The Board's approval on August 22, 1972, of Northern States application 
t 0 become a bank holding company was" based, in part, on Northern States' 
Proposal to increase the capital account of City National by $25 million. 
(1972 Federal Reserve Bulletin 827.) 

—4 — 
aV 
Board notes that Bank has experienced loan losses and is in need of 
additional capital. Northern States plans to immediately augment Bank's 
equity capital by $5 million. As a result of the implementation of this 
Program and the technical assistance that Northern States would be able to 
Provide Bank's managment, the financial condition of Bank would be 
strengthened and its prospects enhanced. Thus, considerations relating to 
the banking factors as they relate to Bank lend weight to approval of the 
Application. It appears that the banking needs of the Lansing banking market 
are being met; however, in view of the improved financial strength of Bank 
resulting from its affiliation with Northern States, Bank should be able to 
improve and expand its banking services. It is the Board's judgment that 
consummation of the proposed acquisition would be in the public interest 
And that the applications should be 
approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications are approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of this 
Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of this Order, 
unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the 
federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority.

The above consent is granted on the condition that DC

specifically exempted by the Guidelines end should be consolidated 
v'il".h those of the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company for 
Purposes of the Guidelines.

The Board authorizes you to enter into a construction

budget of $75,768,000 including artwork allowance, contingen-
cies and architect/engineer fees as described in your letter 
of October 30, 1972 and supporting material. 
While the Board concurs with the contingency allowance 
of '10 per cent for excavation and foundation work, it bali.eves 
that the 5 per cent contingency for general construction (exclu-
sive of excavation and foundation work) should be reduced to 
2 per cent to comply with the "Guidelines for Design and Con-
struction of Federal Reserve Bank Buildings."

&ear Mr, Mcrris: 
On November 15, 1972. I wrote to you that the Board 
approved the construction budget for your new building. 
The 
Purpose of this letter is to convey the Board's concern over 
certain matters so that you can be guided in your future 
Planning. 
i 
During discussion of the proposed construction 
j'udgat., the Board expressed concern with the total amount 
jeing spent by the System for construction of new buildings, 
and with the potential that the buildings might be considered-
actually be-extravagent. 
Either circumstance might trigger 
^ngrcssional review of the exclusion of the System from 
federal appropriations. 
v 
It is hoped that you can review costs that have not 
^eeri fixed by the bidding process to hold them to the minimum 
level desirable. In this regard you might none that the Board 
a s directed that the staff explore the desirability of amending 
Bank building guidelines to reduce the amount to be spent 
for art work. 
Very truly yours-,

Mr. Donald L. Rogers 
Executive Director 
Association of Registered 
Bank Holding Companies 
730 Fifteenth Street, N. W. 
Washington, D. C. 
20005 
Dear Mr. Rogers: 
Your letter of October 10, 1972, requested a statement of 
policy with respect to the statutory time limit requirements pertain-
ing to applications filed under sections 3 and 4(c)(8) of the Bank 
Holding Company Act as amended in 1970. 
Section 3 of the Act (which 
provides for bank acquisitions and holding company formations) reads 
in part: 
"In the event of the failure of the Board to act on 
any application for approval under this section within 
the ninety-one-day period which begins on the date of 
submission to the Board of the complete record on that 
application, the application shall be deemed to have 
been granted." 
A similar provision is contained in section 4(c)(8) which applies to 
applications to engage in activities that the Board determines are 
closely related to banking. 
The Board construes the 91-day provision specified in the 
Act to mean that such period begins to run when, in the judgment of 
the staff, all information needed to reach a decision in a specific 
application has been presented to the Board for its consideration 
If 
more information is subsequently requested by the Board, t h e 1 - d a y 
period is stayed pending receipt of the new information so that the 
remaining portion of the period will begin when the new information 
ITsuTIltZ 
to the Board. 
This construction 
the Boar 
believes 
is 
consistent with the recent decision of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit involving the provision in the Savings 

3 2 6 8 
Mr. Donald L. Rogers 
-2-
and Loan Holding Company Act from which the 91-day provision in the 
Bank Holding Company Act appears to have been adapted. 
(The Fort Worth 
Nati onal Corporation vs FSLIC et al (No. 71-2821; October 12, 1972)). 
The Court decided that the 91-day provision "...indicates an intention 
to commence the time period only after the (Federal Home Loan Bank) 
Board has received all relevant supporting information and reports, 
that is, the complete record." 
The Board believes that since enactment of the 1970 amendments 
to the Bank Holding Company Act, it has acted upon all applications it 
has received within the relevant 91-day statutory provision as interpreted 
above. 
It should be noted that, at a minimum, the complete record on 
a given application cannot be ready for submission to the Board prior to 
the expiration of any comment period. 
Normally, notice of an application 
is published in the Federal Register within five to seven days following 
acceptance of the application by a Reserve Bank. Generally 30 days are 
allowed for comment from interested persons, from the public, and from 
Federal and State supervisory authorities. 
Persons counseling prospec-
tive applicants should avoid any suggestion or assurance that the complete 
record will be before the Board for final action at any time before expi-
ration of the time for submission of comment. 
While the Act sets a time limit for deciding applications, 
the Board has established its own informal target to expedite the pro-
cessing of applications. 
Where possible, the Board attempts to complete 
the processing of such applications within 90 days from the time the 
application is accepted by a Reserve Bank, whether or not additional 
information is needed by the staff or the Board. Additionally, the 
Board has delegated authority to the Reserve Banks to approve certain 
types of applications (formations of one-bank holding companies and 
de novo acquisitions of banks and closely related activities) in a 
further move to expedite the handling of applications. 
During the first nine months of this year, the Federal Reserve 
completed action on '527 holding company and merger applications of all 
types 
both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks. 
More than two-thirds 
of these cases were processed within 90 days from the time an applica-
tion was accepted by a Reserve Bank. 
In half of these cases, the time 
was 75 days or less. Attached for your information are statistical 
tables showing the processing time for completed applications from 
January through September of this year. 
The Board appreciates the importance of time in making 
business decisions and in corporate planning. 
To keep bank holding 

3269 
Mr. Donald L. Rogers 
-3-
companies advised of the status of their applications, the Board's 
staff recently inaugurated a procedure in applications meeting delay 
whereby applicants are advised about 75 days after acceptance of the 
application of the existence of the delay and the reasons for it. 
The Board will continue to seek improvements in its procedures 
to expedite applications to the maximum extent consistent with its 
responsibilities under the Act. 
Very truly yours,
