Report on competitive factors. A revision of the conclusion 
having been agreed upon, unanimous approval was given to the transmittal 
to the Comptroller of the Currency of a report on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed merger of Bank of Nutley, Nutley, New Jersey, 
into First National State Bank of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey. 
In 
the form in which approved, the conclusion read as follows: 
The proposed merger of Bank of Nutley into First National 
State Bank of New Jersey, Newark, would eliminate any existing 
and potential competition between them and would increase the 
concentration of banking resources in Essex County. 
However, 
there would remain, readily accessible to residents of Essex 
County, a wide variety of alternative sources of commercial 
banking services. Overall, the effect of the proposal on 
competition would be adverse. 
Application of First Virginia Corporation (Item No. 2). 
The 
First Virginia Corporation, Arlington, Virginia, had applied for a deter-
mination that proposed insurance activities of its nonbanking subsidiary, 
First Virginia Life Insurance Agency, Inc., were of the kind described in 
section 4(c)(8) (formerly 4(c)(6)) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as 
to make inapplicable the prohibitions of section 4 of the Act with respect 
to the retention of shares in nonbanking companies. First Virginia Life 
Insurance Agency, Inc., proposed to change its name to First Virginia 
Life Insurance Company and to issue and underwrite credit life and dis-
ability insurance on borrowers from the banking subsidiaries of First 
Virginia Corporation. At its meeting on October 10, 1966, the Board 
ordered a hearing on the application, as required by law. Mr. Philip J. 
La Macchia was designated as Hearing Examiner, and the hearing was held 
on November 1, 1966.

Copies of the report and recommended decision of the Hearing 
Examiner were distributed under date of January 13, 1967. There had 
now been distributed a memorandum dated February 9, 1967, from the Legal 
Division expressing agreement with the Hearing Examiner's conclusion that 
the activities planned to be undertaken met the test of section 4(c)(8) 
and recommending that the Board issue an order granting the requested 
determination. A draft of such an order was attached to the Legal Divi-
sion's memorandum. 
The Board authorized by unanimous vote the issuance of the order, 
a copy of which is attached as Item No. 2. 
Monthly deposit data. There had been distributed a memorandum 
dated January 30, 1967, from the Division of Data Processing recommend-
ing publication of a new monthly statistical series showing seasonally 
adjusted deposit data for the 233 Standard Metropolitan Statistical 
Areas included in the bank debits series. These monthly figures for 
total demand deposits, except interbank and U.S. Government, represented 
the deposit base of the debits series, collected for the purpose of 
computing deposit turnover. 
The proposed series would fill a long-standing need for current 
disaggregate regional deposit data. Under publication procedures 
described in the memorandum there would be some duplication between the 
proposed release and the existing debits release (G.6, Bank Debits and 
Deposit Turnover). 
It was contemplated that the two releases would

ultimately be combined into a single publication, but such combination 
was not feasible at this time, principally because of a current shortage 
of computer programmers. 
During discussion of the matter following summary comments by 
Mr. Veenstra, there was general agreement that the merger of the two 
series on debits and deposits should be effected as soon as feasible. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the publication of the 
proposed statistical series on deposits. 
International Investment Insurance Agency (Item No. 3). 
There 
had been distributed a memorandum dated February 10, 1967, from M r . 
Solomon (Adviser) referring to work done by staff of the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development in drafting proposed articles 
of agreement for an International Investment Insurance Agency, which 
would insure investments of developed countries in less developed 
countries. 
The Bank had circulated the draft articles to member governments 
for their comments, and a working group of representatives from interested 
U.S. Government agencies had been set up to consider the proposal. 
This 
working group had decided to ask its member agencies to contact a small 
number of interested private parties with which they had regular dealings 
to ascertain their reaction. Accordingly, it was suggested by M r . Solomon 
that the Board send copies of the draft articles of agreement to each of 
nine specified banks engaged prominently in overseas activities and to 
the Life Insurance Association of America.

2/13/67 
-5" 
Attached to the memorandum was a proposed letter for transmittal 
by the Board to each of the nine banks and to the Life Insurance Associ-
ation. 
M r . Maroni summarized the plan along the lines outlined in the 
distributed material and named several agencies that would be conducting 
the opinion sampling. In response to questions by Governor Brimmer, M r . 
Maroni indicated that he understood the Export-Import Bank would not be 
among the Government agencies engaged in the opinion sampling and that 
the working group felt the inclusion of fire and casualty insurance 
companies would serve no useful purpose because their business interests 
in less developed countries were small. 
Governor Brimmer expressed the view that it would be worth while 
to have the reaction of the Foreign Credit Insurance Association group 
and inquired which agency would contact them. It was understood that 
the staff would follow up on that point. 
Governor Daane suggested that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents 
should be made aware of the opinion-sampling procedure, particularly 
those Presidents in whose Districts recipients of the proposed Board 
letters were headquartered. 
Following further discussion, unanimous approval was given to 
the sending of the proposed letters; a copy of one of the letters is 
attached as Item No. 3. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Mr. Gates: 
The staff of the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) has drafted proposed articles of agreement for an 
International Investment Insurance Agency, which is primarily designed 
to assist private investors in developed countries wishing to make 
investments in less developed countries. The IBRD has circulated the 
draft to representatives of member governments for their comments. 
Representatives of interested U.S. agencies are currently considering 
the matter and would appreciate receiving the views of some of the 
interested businesses and financial institutions in this country. 
The Board has been asked to assist in obtaining such views 
from a few financial institutions, and we shall appreciate your fur-
nishing comments on the proposal outlined in the enclosed draft 
articles of agreement prepared by the IBRD staff. Your suggestions 
on the project as a whole as well as on any points of detail would be 
welcome. It should be emphasized that the document is a first draft 
prepared as a basis for further discussion, and it is not to be 
regarded as a definitive proposal. 
We realize that the draft is fairly lengthy and that it may 
take time for you and your staff to give it the necessary attention, 
but we hope that it will be possible for your bank to furnish some 
comments by the first of March. 
Thank you for your cooperation. 
Sincerely yours 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
