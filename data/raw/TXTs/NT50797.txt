Consent calendar. The Board approved unanimously a letter 
(copy attached as Item No. 1) to The Southern Ohio Bank, Cincinnati, 
Ohio, approving its application for membership in the Federal Reserve 
System. 
A letter (copy attached as Item No. 2) granting consent for 
First Chicago International Finance Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
to purchase and hold additional shares of Mid-America International 
Development Association, Inc., a Liberian corporation, was approved 
unanimously. 
Discount rates. It was anticipated that the directors of the 
five Federal Reserve Banks that had not yet acted to establish a dis-
count rate of 5 per cent would do so today; accordingly, the Board 
authorized the Deputy Secretary to advise those Banks of approval of 
such rates, if fixed, as in the case of the three Banks whose directors 
took similar action on Friday, July 16, 1971. 
Secretary's Note: During the day the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, 
Kansas City, and Dallas advised that their 
directors had established rates of 5 per cent 
on discounts for and advances to member banks 
under Sections 13 and 13a of the Federal Re-
serve Act, 5-1/2 per cent on advances to mem-
ber banks under Section 10(b), and 7 per cent 
on advances to individuals, partnerships, and 
corporations other than member banks under the 
last paragraph of Section 13. The Banks were 
advised of approval of such rates, effective 
July 23,. 1971, and an appropriate press release 
was issued.

First and Merchants Corporation. At yesterday's meeting the 
application of First and Merchants Corporation, Richmond, Virginia, to 
acquire shares of the successor by merger to The First National Bank 
of Danville, Danville, Virginia, had been held over for further consid-
eration. 
Governor Robertson noted that an applicant should bear the 
burden of proof that an acquisition of this kind would be in the public 
interest and explained why he felt that in this case the public interest 
factor had not been established. Discussion indicated that the other 
members of the Board favored approval, and the application was then 
approved, Governor Robertson dissenting. It was understood that an 
order and statement would be prepared for the Board's consideration, 
along with a dissenting statement by Governor Robertson. 
Proposed amendments to Regulations G, T, and U. The Board 
considered proposed amendments to margin Regulations G, T, and U 
designed primarily to implement the provisions of Title III of the 
Foreign Bank Secrecy Act, as set forth in a memorandum dated July 20, 
1971. 
After discussion the Board authorized publication of the imple-
menting amendments with comments to be received not later than Septem-
ber 10, 1971. 
Mr. Solomon pointed out that in addition there were proposed 
amendments designed to make certain unrelated technical improvements 

1

in the regulations. It was agreed that those would be published 
separately, and that the complete package of proposals to be published 
for comment would be subject to final review by Governor Robertson, 
who had pointed out certain apparent technical flaws in the drafting. 
Copies of the press release subsequently issued, the proposed 
amendments to implement Title III, and the other proposed amendments 
are attached under Item No. 3. 
Joint Economic Committee testimony. The Board discussed a 
draft of testimony to be given by Chairman Burns before the Joint 
Economic Committee on July 23, 1971. There was general agreement on 
the overall tone and content of the draft, except that Governor Maisel, 
who had in mind particularly the current Treasury financing, expressed 
reservations, in light of reactions he anticipated in the market and 
elsewhere, because the statement could be interpreted to imply that the 
Federal Reserve, being concerned about persisting inflationary pressures 
and the inadequacy of policies to deal with the problem, was prepared 
to adopt a more restrictive monetary policy, with resultant higher 
interest rates. 
It was understood that the draft would be reviewed in light of 
all the comments made during today's discussion and would then be pre-
sented in a final form satisfactory to Chairman Burns. 
(Note: A copy 
of the statement, as presented, has been placed in the Board's files.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

Item No. 3 
7/22/71 
for immediate release 
J u ly 26> 1C;/i 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
Proposed regulatory amendments to carry out the provisions of 
Title III of the Foreign Bank Secrecy Act (Public Law 91-508 enacted 
October 26, 1970) that relate to margin credit requirements. Comments 
°n the proposals should be submitted to the Board by September 10. 
That Act for the first time specifically requires borrowers 
comply with margin regulations in securities transactions. These 
regulations previously applied only to lenders. This part of the Act 
will go into effect with the effective date of the Board's regulatory 
amendments, but in no case later than November 1, 1971. 
Margin regulations are designed to prevent the excessive use 
credit in financing securities transactions. Regulation T applies 
t o all securities credit extended by brokers and dealers; Regulation U 
applies to credit by banks for the purpose of purchasing or carrying 
Margin stocks, while Regulation G applies to securities credit by persons 
°ther than banks, brokers, or dealers. 
Major provisions of the proposals would: 
1. Require that all U. S. citizens and residents comply with 
margin regulations when they borrow from a lender, domestic or foreign, 
^ i s provision would also apply to foreigners controlled by U. S. 
borrowers or persons acting in behalf or in conjunction with a U. S. 
borrower. 

1801 
-2-
2. Provide that the restrictions on borrowers apply to 
credit extended, arranged or maintained after the effective date of 
the amendments. Six months after the effective date of the amend-
ments, restrictions on substitutions and withdrawals from margin 
accounts would apply to credit extended after October 26, 1970. 
3. Clarify the applicability of the registration, reporting 
and other requirements of Regulation G. A U. S. person or foreigner 
controlled by U. S. persons, whose office is located outside the United 
States, would be required to register with the Federal Reserve Bank of. 
New York. 
4. Provide that foreign branches or affiliates of U. S. 
broker-dealers may extend purpose credit to foreign customers without 
regard to U. S. margin requirements. 
5. Impose parallel restrictions on credit extended by foreign 
offices or affiliates of U. S. banks which are now exempt from margin 
regulation. 
6. Provide that a foreign subsidiary of a U. S. corporation 
may extend exempt credit to its foreign employes to exercise options 
to buy stock in the U. S. parent. 
At the same time, the Board proposed amendments that would make 
several technical changes in the regulations relating to the treatment 
°f short sales and so-called "clearance" transactions by banks and lenders 
subject to Regulation G. 
A copy of the proposed amendments is attached.

SECURITIES CREDIT BY PERSONS OTHER THAN 
BANKS, BROKERS, OR DEALERS 
1. The Board of Governors proposes to amend Part 207 (Regu-
iatlon G) to implement the provisions of Title III of the Financial 
Recordkeeping and Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 
1970 (Pub. L. Na 91-508, October 26, 1970). This would be 
accomplished by amending § 207.1(a) and (b), § 207.2(i), § 207.3(a) 
a n d (b), § 207.4(a) and (d), and by adding § 207.0, § 207.l(k) and 
§ 207.2(k) and (1), as set forth below. 
2. The proposed amendment to paragraph (a) in § 207.1 
would clarify that a person is not subject to registration under this 
Paragraph unless such person is a United States person, or under the 
control of a United States person or acting on behalf of or in con-
junction with such person; would provide that the determination as 
t o whether a person has extended, maintained or arranged credit in 
^ e minimum amount necessary to bring the person within the regis-
tration requirement shall be made as of any calendar or fiscal quarter; 
and would provide that a person whose principal office is not located 
any Federal Reserve district may register with the Federal Reserve 
fiank of New York. 
3. The proposed amendment of paragraph (b) of § 207.1 would 
Provide that a registrant whose principal office is not located in any 

- 1 
-
Federal Reserve district may de-register with the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York. 
4. The proposed new paragraph (k) of § 207.1 would implement 
the provisions of Title III of the Financial Recordkeeping and Currency 
and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (Pub. L. No. 91-508, 
October 26, 1970) by providing that customers who are United States 
Persons or foreign persons controlled by such persons, or acting on 
behalf of or in conjunction with such persons, may not obtain credit 
except in compliance with applicable margin regulations of the Board 
Governors, and that if the extender of the credit is not subject 
t o such regulations, the credit must comply with the provisions of 
this part. The requirements of paragraph (k) would apply to credit 
attended after the effective date of the amendments, and such credit 
already extended at that time would be subject to the retention and 
Withdrawal requirements of paragraph (j) of § 207.1 beginning 6 
Months after such date. 
5. The proposed amendment of paragraph (i) of § 207.2 
clarify that credit extended to a customer by a person whether 
not subject to the registration requirement of § 207.1(a) (for 
example, by a foreign person who is not controlled by or acting in 
injunction with or on behalf of a United States person) is indirectly 
8ecured by margin stock if described in that paragraph. 
6. The proposed new paragraph (k) of § 207.2 incorporates 
the statutory definition of "United States person". 

7. The proposed new paragraph (1) of § 207.2 incorporates 
the statutory definition of "foreign person controlled by a United 
* 
States person". 
8. The proposed amendment of paragraph (a) of § 207.3 
Provides that a person subject to the registration requirement of 
§ 207.1(a) whose principal office is not located in a Federal Reserve 
district shall file required quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. 
9. The proposed amendment of paragraph (b) of § 207.3 pro-
vides that United States persons and foreign persons controlled by 
such persons who obtain, receive, or enjoy the beneficial use of any 
Purpose credit shall maintain such records, and that all such persons, 
and all persons registered pursuant to § 207.1(a), shall file such 
Reports as the Board shall prescribe to enable it to perform the 
Unctions conferred upon it by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
<15 U.S.C. 78). 
10. The proposed new paragraph (a)(4) of § 207.4 provides 
that a foreign plan-lender extending credit solely to foreign persons 
i s not subject to this part if any United States person who extends, 
arranges, or has outstanding any credit extended to or by such foreign 
Plan-lender complies with the registration and reporting requirements 
o f §§ 207.1(a) and 207.3. 
11. The proposed amendment to paragraph (d) of § 207.4 
Provides that mechanical mistakes made in good faith by a customer, 

m 
1

5 
- 4 -
a s well as by a lender, shall not constitute a violation of this part 
if prompt action is taken to remedy the noncompliance. 
12. At the time the proposed amendments are adopted, foot-
n°tes 5 & 6 in § 207.1(f) will be redesignated footnotes 7 and 8, 
respectively. 
To aid in the consideration by the Board of this matter, 
interested persons are invited to submit relevant data, views, or 
arguments. Any such material should be submitted in writing to the 
Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, 
C. 20551, to be received not later than September 10, 1971. Such 
^terial will be made available for inspection and copying upon 
request, except as provided in § 261.6(a) of the Board1s Rules 
Regarding Availability of Information.
