Minutes of a meeting of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System on Sunday, August 15, 1971. The Board met in the Board 
Room at 9:20 p.m. 
PRESENT: Mr. Burns, Chairman 
Mr. Robertson, Vice Chairman 
Mr. Mitchell 
Mr. Daane 
Mr. Maisel 
Mr. Brimmer 
Mr. Holland, Executive Director 
Mr. Broida, Assistant Secretary 
Mr. Bernard, Assistant Secretary 
Mr. Molony, Assistant to the Board 
Mr. Coyne, Special Assistant to the Board 
Mr. Gramley, Associate Director, Division of 
Research and Statistics 
Prior to this meeting the members of the Board had gathered at 
around 8:30 p.m. for an informal briefing by Chairman Burns who outlined 
and commented upon the salient features of the Administration s new 
economic programâ€”to be announced by the President on national television 
and radio at 9:00 p.m. E.D.T. The Chairman stated that he supported the 
over-all program fully. His sole reservation related to the desirability 
of suspending temporarilv the convertibility of the dollar into gold or 
other reserve assets. He had argued during the week-end meeting of the 
President with his Government advisers at Camp David, Maryland, that 
such suspension was not really necessary given the strength of the rest 
of the program. In the end, however, the decision was made to include 
this action in the package of measures; and viewing the set of actions 
as an integrated package, Chairman Burns felt that the program deserved 
the support of all System officials.

Chairman Burns added that President Nixon had invited him to 
serve as a member of the Cost of Living Council, which was being estab-
lished to oversee the wage and price freeze, but on his (Chairman Burns') 
recommendation, the President had agreed to appoint him to a more limited 
function as adviser to the Council. 
Members of the Board subsequently retired to the Board members' 
special library to watch President Nixon announce his new economic pro-
gram on television. (A copy of the President's message is attached as 
Item No. 1.) 
Following the President's telecast, the Board reconvened in the 
Board Room. Chairman Burns noted that he planned to telephone a number 
of foreign central bankers immediately following this meeting to comment 
briefly on the President's program. He intended to emphasize the need 
to start the rebuilding process promptly and to work for an early resolu-
tion of the problems in the international monetary area. He also noted 
that Governor Daane was scheduled to leave for Europe later in the 
evening with Mr. Volcker, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary 
Affairs. The purpose of their trip would be to explain the President's 
program to officials of key European countries, including both the 
domestic objectives of curbing inflation while stimulating production 
and employment and the international objective of dealing with the 
nation's serious balance of payments problem. With regard to the latter, 
he thought it would be important to point out that the additional 10 

2052

per cent tax on imports into the United States was intended to be a 
temporary measure and that the United States was eager to work out an 
orderly realignment of exchange rates in consultation with other 
countries. In this connection it would be helpful to have the preliminary 
views of foreign officials regarding the possibilities for such realign-
ment. He expressed the judgment that another Bretton Woods conference 
would not be an appropriate forum for working out changes in exchange 
rates or for making other necessary changes in the international monetary 
mechanism. Rather, he thought it would be preferable for a few leading 
countries to be involved in the negotiations, with some representation 
of the views of smaller countries. He added that protracted negotiations 
should be avoided if at all possible. 
Governor Daane indicated that he and Mr. Volcker would be meeting 
in London tomorrow afternoon (August 16) with officials from three or 
four major G-10 countries. This meeting would probably be followed by 
bilateral discussions in other European cities. 
Chairman Burns then suggested that the Board members give 
Governor Daane whatever advice they thought might be helpful to him in 
the talks he and Mr. Volcker were about to undertake. 
Governor Mitchell suggested that it would be important to explain 
to European officials which portions of the Administration's program were 
to be put into effect immediately and which would depend on Congressional 
action. With regard to the possible realignment of exchange rate parities,

he did not know whether or not the dollar was presently overvalued. 
However, he had no doubts about the need to improve the international 
monetary mechanism and he agreed with Chairman Burns that prompt action 
was highly desirable. The foreign exchange markets were likely to 
remain subject to strong speculative pressures until the basic questions 
about the international monetary mechanism were resolved. An alterna-
tive, or perhaps a complement, to a dollar devaluation would be to widen 
the foreign exchange bands. 
Chairman Burns said he agreed with Treasury officials who felt 
the dollar was overvalued, but he was not persuaded that the overvalua-
tion was great. While the evidence did not permit confident judgments 
on this subject, he was nevertheless troubled by those who talked in 
terms of seeking a maximum devaluation of the dollar. In his opinion, 
the atmosphere was now favorable to a realignment of currency values, 
and his inclination would be to try to work out promptly reasonable 
revaluations with the major foreign countries. 
Governor Maisel said he would not be in any hurry to establish 
new parities unless exchange rate adjustments of around 10 per cent 
could be agreed to and unless some automatic mechanism for adjusting 
parities could be worked out promptly. He thought it would be a mistake 
to return to the Bretton Woods arrangements, and he did not think a 
widening of exchange rate bands would be a sufficient remedy for the

problems created by large speculative movements of funds. Unless some 
basic structural changes were made in the international payments system, 
repetitive crises were likely as a result of recurring waves of specula-
tion. He added that the Federal Reserve had an important influence on 
international flows of funds through its influence on interest rates, 
and in his view domestic interest rates should not be permitted to rise. 
During the subsequent discussion, Chairman Burns noted that the 
Administration had decided not to impose ceilings on interest rates on 
the grounds that they were likely to prove counterproductive. However, 
the possibility of asking the Federal Reserve to regulate interest 
rates on consumer loans had been left open. 
Governor Brimmer observed that the dollar was now in effect 
floating against foreign currencies. He assumed that the float would 
be transitional and that there would be a return to fixed parities 
under a new international monetary mechanism that incorporated needed 
changes. Perhaps the most significant message Messrs. Daane and Volcker 
might convey to foreign monetary officials was that it was desirable to 
arrive at decisions within a reasonably short period of time. 
Governor Robertson said he agreed that it would be desirable to 
make the changes in the international monetary system as promptly as 
possible. In response to a question by Governor Brimmer, he also 
expressed the view that the present circumstances presented a good 
opportunity to terminate the voluntary foreign credit restraint program.

Other members of the Board indicated that they shared this 
view. Chairman Burns indicated that while he hoped that all controls 
could be lifted soon, he had argued against doing this now at the Camp 
David meeting. 
It was agreed that the domestic implications of the President's 
new economic program would be discussed at later Board meetings. 
The meeting then adjourned.

THE WHITE HOUSE 
ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT 
ON NATIONWIDE RADIO AND TELEVISION 
SUNDAY, AUGUST 15, 1971 
THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE 
Good Evening: 
I have addressed the nation a number of times over the past two years on 
the problems of ending a war. 
Because of the progress we have made toward 
achieving that goal, this Sunday evening is an appropriate time for us to 
turn our attention to the challenges of peace. 
America today has the best opportunity in this century to attain two of its 
greatest ideals; to bring about a full generation of peace, and to create a 
new prosperity without war. 
. T h l s 
n o t o n l Y requires hold leadership ready to take bold action - - it calls 
forth the greatness in a great people. 
Prosperity without war requires action on three fronts; we must create more 
and better jobs; we must stop the rise in the cost of living; we must protect 
the dollar from the attacks of international money speculators. 
We are going to take that action. 
Not timidly, not half-heartedly, not in 
piecemeal fashion. 
We are going to move forward to the new prosperity 
without war as befits a great people - - all together, and along a broad front. 
The time has come for a New Economic Policy for the United States; its 
targets are unemployment, inflation and international speculation. 
Here is 
how we are going to attack them. 
First, on the subject of jobs. 
We all know why we have an unemployment problem: 
Two million workers have 
been released f r o m the Armed F o r c e s and defense plants because of our success 
in winding down the war in Vietnam. 
Putting those people back to work is one 
of the challenges of peace, and we have begun to make progress. 
Cur unem-
ployment rate today is below the average of the four peacetime years of the 
60s. 
But we can and must do better. 
The time has come for American industry, which has produced more jobs at 
higher real wages than any other industrial system in history to embark on 
a bold program of new investment in production for peace. 
To give that system a powerful new stimulus, I shall ask the Congress when 
it reconvenes after its summer recess to consider as its first priority the 
enactment of the Job Development Act of 1971. 
(MORE) 

- 2 -
I propose to provide the strongest short-term incentive in our history to 
invest in new machinery and equipment that will create new jobs for Americans: 
A 10% Job Development Credit for one year, effective as of today, with a 
5% credit after August 15, 1972. 
This tax credit for investment in new 
equipment will not only generate new jobs, but will raise productivity and 
make our goods more competitive in the years ahead. 
I propose to repeal the 7% excise tax on automobiles, effective today. 
This 
will mean a reduction in price of about $200 per car. 
I shall insist that the 
American auto industry pass this tax reduction on to its nearly 8 million 
customers who are buying automobiles this year. 
Lower prices will mean 
that more people will be able to afford new cars, and every additional 100, 000 
cars sold means 25, 000 new jobs. 
I propose to speed up the personal income tax exemptions scheduled for 
January 1, 1973, to January 1, 1972 - - so that taxpayers can deduct an extra 
$50 for each exemption one year earlier than planned. 
This increase in 
consumer spending power will provide a strong boost to the economy in 
general and to employment in particular. 
The tax reductions I am recommending, taken together with the broad upturn 
of the economy which has taken place in the first half of this year, will move 
us strongly toward a goal this nation has not reached since 1956 - - prosperity 
with full employment in peacetime. 
Looking to the future, I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to 
recommend to the Congress in January new tax proposals for stimulating 
research and development of new industries and new technologies to help 
provide the 20 million new jobs that America needs for the young people who 
will be coming into the job market in the next decade. 
To offset the loss of revenue from these tax cuts which directly stimulate new 
jobs, I have ordered a $4. 7 billion cut in Federal spending. 
Tax cuts to stimulate employment must be matched by spending cuts to restrain 
inflation. 
To check the rise in the cost of government, I have ordered post-
ponement of pay raises and a 5 percent cut in government employment. 
I have ordered a 10% cut in foreign economic aid. 
In addition, since the Congress has already delayed action on two of the great 
initiatives of this Administration, I will ask Congress to amend my proposals 
to postpone the implementation of Revenue Sharing for three months and 
Welfare Reform for one year. 
In this way , I am reordering our budget priorities to concentrate more on 
achieving full employment. 
The second indispensable element of the new prosperity is to stop the rise in 
the cOSt of living. 
One of the c r u d e s t legacies of the artificial prosperity produced by war is 
inflation. 
Inflation robs every American. 
The 20 million who are retired and 
living on fixed incomes are particularly hard hit. 
Homemakers find it harder 
than ever to balance the family budget. 
And 80 million wage earners have 
been on a treadmill; in the four war years between 1965 and 1969, their wage 
increases were completely eaten up by price increases. 
Their paychecks 
were higher, but they were no better off. 
MORE 

We have made progress against the rise in the cost of living; f r o m the high 
point of 6% a year in 1969, the rise in consumer prices has been cut to 
4% in the first half of 1971. 
But just as in our fight against unemployment, 
we can and must do better. 
The time ha s come for decisive action to break the vicious circle of spiraling 
prices and costs. 
I am today ordering a freeze on all prices and wages throughout the United 
States, for a period of ninety days. 
In addition, I call upon corporations to 
extend that wage-price freeze to all dividends. 
I have today appointed a Cost of Living Council within the government. 
I have 
directed this Council to work with leaders of labor and business to set up the 
proper mechanism for achieving continued price and wage stability after the 
90 day freeze is over. 
Let me emphasize two characteristics to this action: 
One, it is temporary. 
To put the strong, vigorous American economy into a permanent strait -
jacket would lock in unfairness and stifle the expansion of our free enterprise 
system. 
Two, while the wage-price freeze will be backed by government 
sanctions if necessary, it will not be accompanied by the establishment of a 
huge price-control bureaucracy. 
I am relying on the voluntary cooperation 
of all Americans 
- - workers, employers, consumers - - to make this freeze 
work. 
Working together, we will break the back of inflation, and we will do it without 
the mandatory wage and price controls that crush economic and personal 
freedom. 
The third indispensable element in building the new prosperity is closely 
related to creating new jobs and halting inflation. 
We must protect the position 
of the American dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world. 
In the past seven years, there has been an average of one international 
monetary crisis every year. 
Who gains from these c r i s e s ? 
Not the working-
man, not the investor, not the real producers of wealth. 
The gainers are the 
international money speculators. 
Because they thrive on crises, they help 
to create them. 
In recent weeks, the speculators have been waging an all-out war on the 
American dollar. 
The strength of a nation's currency is based on the strength 
of that nation'8 economy - - and the American economy is by far the strongest 
in the world. 
Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to 
take the action necessary to defend the dollar against the speculators. 
I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility 
of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and 
conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the 
best interests of the United States. 
Let me lay to rest the bugaboo of devaluation. 
What does this action mean 
for you? 
If you want to buy a foreign car, or take a trip abroad, market conditions may 
cause your dollar to buy slightly less. 
But if you are among the overwhelming 
majority who buy American-made products in America your dollar will be 
worth just as much tomorrow as it is today. 
The effect of this action will be to stabilize the dollar. 
This action will not win us any friends among the international money traders. 
But our primary concern is with the American wprkers, and with fair 
competition around the world. 
MORE 

To our friends abroad, including the many responsible members of the 
international banking community who are dedicated to stability and the flow 
of trade, I give this assurance: 
The United States has always been, and will 
continue to be, a forward-looking and trustworthy trading partner. 
In full 
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and those who trade with 
us, we will press for the necessary reforms to set up an urgently needed 
new international monetary system. 
Stability and equal treatment is in 
everybody's best interest. 
I am determined that the American dollar must 
never again be a hostage in the hands of the international speculators. 
I am taking one further step to protect the dollar, to improve our balance 
of payments, and to increase U.S. jobs. 
As a temporary measure, I am 
today imposing an additional tax of 10% on goods imported into the United 
States. 
This is a better solution for international trade than direct controls 
on the amount of imports. 
This import tax is a temporary action - - not directed against any other coun-
try, but an action to make certain that American products will not be at a 
disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates. 
When the unfair treatment 
is ended, the import tax will end as well. 
As a result of these actions, the product of American labor will be more 
competitive, and the unfair edge that some of our foreign competition has had 
will be removed. 
That is a major reason why our trade balance has eroded 
over the past fifteen years. 
At the end of World War II, the economies of the major industrial nations of 
Europe and Asia were shattered. 
To help them get on their feet and to 
protect their freedom, the United States has provided 143 billion dollars in 
foreign aid. 
That was the right thing for us to do. 
Today, largely with our help, they have regained their vitality and have 
become strong competitors. 
Now that other nations are economically strong 
the time has. come for them to bear their fair share of the burden of defending 
freedom around the world. 
The time has come for exchange rates to be set 
straight and for the major nations to compete as equals. 
There is no longer 
any need for the United States to compete with one hand tied behind her back. 
The range of actions I have taken and proposed tonight - - o n the job front, 
on the inflation front, on the monetary front - - i s the most comprehensive 
New Economic Policy to be undertaken by this nation in four decades. 
We are fortunate to live in a nation with an economic system capable of 
producing for its people the highest standard of living in the world; flexible 
enough to change its ways dramatically when circumstances call for change; 
and most important - - resourceful enough to produce prosperity with freedom 
and opportunity unmatched in the history of nations. 
The purposes of the government actions I have announced tonight are to lay 
the basis for renewed confidence, to make it possible for us to compete fairly, 
with the rest of the world, to open the door to a new prosperity. 
But government, with all its powers, does not hold the key to the success of 
a people. 
That key, my fellow Americans, is in your hands. 
(MORE) 

- 5 -
A nation, like a person, has to have a certain inner drive in order to succeed. 
In economic affairs, that inner drive is called the competitive spirit. 
Every action I have taken tonight is designed to nurture and stimulate that 
competitive spirit, to help us snap out of that self-doubt and self-disparage -
ment that saps our energy and erodes our confidence in ourselves. 
Whether this nation stays number one in the world's economy or resigns 
itself to second or third or fourth place; whether we as a people instill our 
faith in ourselves, or lose that faith; whether we hold fast to the strength 
that makes peace and freedom possible in this world, or lose our grip - - all 
that depends on your competitive spirit, your sense of personal destiny, your 
pride in your country and in yourself. 
We can be certain of this: As the threat of war recedes, the challenge of 
peaceful competition increases. 
We welcome this competition, because America is at her greatest when she 
is called on to compete. 
And no nation has anything to fear from our c o m -
petition, because we lead our competitors on to new heights for their own 
people. 
As there always have been in our history, there will be voices urging us to 
shrink from that challenge, to build a protective wall around ourselves, to 
crawl into a shell as the rest of the world moves ahead. 
Two hundred years ago, a man wrote in his diary: 
"Many thinking people 
believe America has seen its best days, " 
That was just before the American 
Revolution in 1775, at the dawn of the most exciting era in the history of man. 
Today, we hear the echoes of those voices, preaching a gospel of gloom and 
defeat, saying that same thing: 
"We have seen our best days. " 
Let Americans reply: 
"Our best days lie ahead." 
As we move into a generation of peace, as we blaze the trail toward the new 
prosperity, I say to every American: 
Let us raise our spirits. 
Let us raise 
our sights. 
Let all of us contribute all we can to the great and good country 
that contributes so much to the progress of mankind. 
Let us invest in our nation's futurej and let us revitalize that faith in ourselves 
that built a great nation in the past, and will shape the world of the future.
