Pennsylvania, granting its request for permission to continue to hold 
the stock of New World Development Corporation, Nassau, Bahamas, after 
issuance by the latter of promissory notes aggregating approximately 
$1,000,000 with maturities in excess of one year. A copy of the letter 
is attached as Item No. 1. 
Edge corporation. Detroit Bank and Trust Company, Detroit, 
Michigan, had applied for permission to organize a corporation, pur-
suant to section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, to be known as 
Detroit Bank and Trust International, the home office of which would be 
in Detroit. 
Application also had been made for establishment by the 
subsidiary corporation of a branch in Nassau, Bahamas. 
The application to organize the Edge corporation was approved 
unanimously, while the branch application was approved with Governor 
Robertson dissenting. A copy of the letter sent to Detroit Bank and 
Trust Company is attached as Item No. 2. 
Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed purchase of assets and assumption of 
liabilities of Utah National Bank of Provo, Provo, Utah, by Zions First 
National Bank, Salt Lake City, Utah, was approved unanimously for 
transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency, the conclusion stating 
that the proposed acquisition would have no adverse comeptitive effects 

7/23/69

Classification of competitive factor reports. By letter 
dated April 15, 1969, Senator Proxmire had requested a classification 
°f competitive factor reports rendered in bank merger cases during 
the period from 1960 through March 31, 1969. Similar requests had 
been directed to the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, and the Department of Justice. 
As stated in a memorandum from the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation dated July 1, 1969, representatives of the respective 
agencies had classified the reports submitted by such agencies during 
the aforementioned period according to whether, in each case, the 
Proposed transaction would have substantially adverse, some adverse, or 
no adverse effects. The resulting combined tabulation, proposed for 
transmittal to Senator Proxmire, was submitted with the memorandum. 
In a second memorandum, dated July 22, 1969, the Division noted 
that according to the tabulation the Comptroller, in his reports, viewed 
30 applications subsequently approved by the Board as likely to have 
substantially adverse competitive effects. Of those reports, 26 had 
been submitted to the Board during the period 1960-1965. Part of the 
Problem appeared to relate to the fact that each agency had classified 
its own reports, and a question of judgment was involved since the 
language used by the agencies in submitting the reports originally did 
n°t coincide with the categories used by Senator Proxmire. For example, 

2338 
7/23/69 
-4-
as far as the reports submitted by the Board were concerned, the 
second category used by the Senator included opinions in which the 
competitive effects were judged to range from slightly adverse to 
father seriously adverse. 
The Division suggested that there appeared to be no way of making 
the tabulation appreciably more meaningful except to add another category, 
so that the reports would be classified as substantially adverse, 
adverse, slightly adverse, or not adverse in terms of the comeptitive 
effects that were envisaged. However, that would require the cooperation 
°f all of the agencies and would delay submission of the material. 
{ 
With the July 22 memorandum the Division submitted a revised 
draft of letter to Senator Proxmire in which an effort had been made to 
spell out the difficulties encountered. 
Board members expressed some concern, particularly about sub-
mitting a tabulation in which it would be indicated that in such a 
large number of cases the Board had approved applications where the 
Comptroller had expressed an opinion that the proposed transaction 
have a substantially adverse effect on competition. While the 
revised transmittal letter was regarded as achieving some degree of 
clarifi cation, apprehension was expressed that the tabulation might 
be made available to readers without the benefit of the letter. It 
was suggested, therefore, that explanatory notes might be included in 
fche tabulation itself. 

2339 
7/23/69 
-5-
Another suggestion was that the tabulation might be reworked 
so as to show a breakdown of opinions received in years prior to 1966 
and from that point forward, while a further suggestion was that the 
reports be reclassified through the addition of another category along 
lines mentioned in the July 22 memorandum. 
In that connection, however, 
it was understood that the other agencies were even now preparing to 
transmit their tabulations. 
The proposed reply was then turned back to the staff for 
further consideration in light of the comments and suggestions that 
had been made, with the understanding that it would then be transmitted 
to Senator Proxmire over the signature of Chairman Martin. 
Note: A copy of the letter subsequently sent by Chairman 
Martin to Senator Proxmire is attached as Item No. 3; a copy of the 
tabulation transmitted with the letter has been placed in the Board's 
Financial General. After consideration of information con-
tained in a memorandum from the Legal Division dated July 9, 1969, 
the Board approved unanimously a letter in the form attached as Item 
to Chairman Patman of the House Banking and Currency Committee in 
response to his inquiry as to whether actions taken by Financial General 
Corporation, Washington, D. C., and its subsidiaries for the purpose 
i 
! V 
divestiture of nonbanking interests were in compliance with the 
Provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended in 1966.

The Board also approved a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond in the form attached as Item No. 5. 
Report of Venture Capital Panel. After further consideration 
of drafts that had been submitted of a reply to an inquiry made by the 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology with respect 
to a report on financing of new technological enterprises that had been 
rendered by the Venture Capital Panel of the Commerce Technical Advisory 
Board, unanimous approval was given to the transmittal of a letter in the 
form attached as Item No. 6. 
Letter to Mr. Rockefeller. After discussion, unanimous approval 
was given to a letter in the form attached as Item No. 7 to Mr. David 
Rockefeller, Chairman of the Board of The Chase Manhattan Bank (National 
Association), New York, New York, in reply to his letter addressed to 
Chai rman Martin with respect, principally, to the interest rate ceilings 
applicable to large-denomination certificates of deposit issued by banks. 
Boston salary structure. Pursuant to request of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston, the Board approved unanimously, effective 
August 1, 1969, revisions of the minimums and maximums for the respective 
grades of the salary structure applicable to employees of the Bank. A 
c°Py of the letter sent to the Bank pursuant to this action is attached 
as Item No. 8.

Hie Foard's staff held several meetings with representatives 
the' Department of Justice, the Office of the Comptroller of the

oordlnnte the preparation of Exhibit A. The Board's staff reviewed 
t^a competitive factor reports the floard submitted to the Comptroller 
the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fron If?CO 
0 *nrch 31, 1969, and classified then according to the categories you 
Prescribed, i.e., as indicating the proposal to have substantially 
<verne effects, sore but less than substantially adverse effects, or 
no adverse effects.

Another major difficulty occurs in categorizing the reports 
according to the terr« designated in Exhibit A. It in important to 
eriphasizo that the three Hank Supervisory Agencies have classified 
their reports on the ban is of their ov n judgments ami that none of the 
categories used by the Ap.encion coincides with the classification 
requested in Inhibit A. One food illustration in found in the I'DIC 
reports to the Hoard, most of which in recent ycirs have concluded 
t,4at the competitive effect would be either unfavorable" or not 
^favorable." Another example is found in the fact that, while the 
Hoard now uses specific terms to indicate the overall cor>petitivo effect, 
prior to the last two years it did not limit Its conclusions to such 
Prescribed terminology• T.n the circumstances, it in clear that an 
individual compiling data for V.yMbit A Una in many casej a considerable 
Amount of latitude in determining the category to be used. Also, this 
individual most likely ia not familiar with the case and lacks the 
timej:hat would be necessary to erar.ii.ne and absorb the substantial 
volum® of information available when the report was written. 
Finally, category (2) of Exhibit A encompassco a wide ran^e 
decrees to which a proposal is considered to be adverse. The 
^aterlnl for tliio caption would be wore meaningftil wore it distributed 
in such n way as to differentiate between the cases in which the adverse 
effects oF the proposal were so slight as to be of little importance 
those in which they were more seriously adverse.

July 24, 1969 
The Honorable Wright Patman, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
°ear Mr. Chairman: 
This refers to your letter of May 12, 1969, inquiring whether 
the actions taken by Financial General Corporation ("FG") and its sub-
sidiaries, for the purpose of divestiture of nonbanking interests, are 
in compliance with the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 
x956 as amended in 19 66 ("the Act"). 
In order to afford its stockholders certain tax relief, FG 
Proposed to carry out its divestiture in accordance with the pro-
visions of sections 1101-1103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
\ the Code"), which provisions were amended by Congress in 1967 for 
ne purpose of affording to corporations brought under the Act by the 
966 amendments - with FG particularly in mind - substantially the 
same kind of tax treatment as was extended to bank holding companies 
l n 1.956. FG proposed to effect the major portion of its divestment 
Program by transferring the stock of certain nonbanking subsidiaries 
0 a new corporation, Financial Security Corporation ("FSC"), created 
<jnd availed of solely for the purpose of effecting the proposed 
1vestiture; and to receive, in exchange, the stock of FSC, which FG 
^ould then distribute immediately to FG's stockholders. 
FG proposed 
° retain - at least for the time being - all of the outstanding stock 
t 
Financial Mortgage Corporation, a nonbanking subsidiary; and planned 
° change the operations of said subsidiary (and of its subsidiaries) 
S o that FG's interest therein would cease to be "prohibited" property. 
Under FG's divestment program, its stockholders will have 
^wnership and control of FSC as well as of FG. Since this result 
lows from a distribution that Congress authorized as a method of 
vestment that warrants favorable tax treatment, such ownership and 
ntrol is considered to be appropriate under the Act. 

O*) -1 
3'he Honorable Wright Patman 
-2-
Upon application by FG, and on the basis of the. facts of 
record before the Board, the Board concluded that FG was entitled to 
a Prior Tax Certification to the effect that FG is a "qualified" bank 
holding company; that the shares of scock it proposed to distribute 
to FSC include property which could be distributed directly (under 
section 1101(a)(1) of the Code) to shareholders without recognition 
°f gain to such shareholders; and that the proposed exchange and 
distribution are appropriate to effectuate section 4 of the Act. 
Accordingly, a Prior Tax Certification was issued to FG. 
It is our understanding that FG received a favorable tax 
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and effected the divestment 
a s Proposed. However, said Prior Tax Certification is a provisional 
step only. Before the tax relief is assured to shareholders, FG 
must: obtain from the Board a Final Tax Certification to the effect 
that FG has disposed of all the property the distribution of which 
is necessary or appropriate to effectuate section 4 of the Act. As 
know, Congress £ave FG until 19/8 to dispose of its nonbank 
interests. 
The Board has FG1 s divestiture procedure under current con-
sideration and will continue to examine the various aspects of tne 
distributions made and to be made in order to assure that FG has not 
retained control of the shares transferred by it and that it has 
complied with both the letter and the spirit of the Congressional 
directives for divestment. A Final Tax Certification will not be 
granted unless the Board is satisfied that all the statutory 
requirements have been fulfilled. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.

Dear Mr. Upshaw: 
This refers to your letters of June 13 and 18, 1969, in 
which you direct our attention to (a) the provisions of section 
2(g)(3) of the Holding Company Act, (b) the Prior Tax Certification 
issued to Financial General Corporation ("FG") in connection with 
its transfer of shares in certain nonbanking companies to Financial 
Securities Corporation C'FSC") in exchange for the stock of FSC, which 
FG thereuD on distributed to its shareholders (including International 
Bank ("IB") and Financial International Corporation ("FIC")), and 
( c ) the fact that IB and FIC have directors in common with FG. Your 
letter suggests that, by virtue of section 2(g)(3), the FSC shares 
transferred by FG to IB and FIC should be deemed to be controlled by 
FG; that FG is not entitled to the Prior Tax Certification it received"; 
and that said interlocking directorships cause FG to be ineligible for 
a Final Tax Certification. 
The Board considered this matter on July 23 and reserved its 
decision at this time, in order to afford FG an opportunity to present 
xts views with respect to the facts and the law. Accordingly, you are 
requested to ask FG (L) to verify the interlocking directorships that 
you describe, (2) to furnish any other information that relates to 
^filiations between FG and its distributees (including but not limited 
t o IB and FIC) in order that we may determine whether the presumption 
in section 2(g)(3) is applicable, (3) to comment on the legal implica-
tions of said relationships in the light of section 2(g)(3), and (4) 
t o advise your Bank as to FG1s plans for further divestment action. 
Please keep the. Board informed of developments.

JUL 2 41969 
Mr. Myron Tribus, 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for 
Science and Technology, 
Department of Commerce, 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Mr. Tribus: 
Thank you for your letter of June 25 and the draft 
paper "Financing New Technological Enterprise" (a report of 
the Venture Capital Panel of the Commerce Technical Advisory 
Board). 
The report's position that commercial banks " . . . can 
become an important catalyst in the venture capital network . . ." 
because they ". . . are often the first point of contact . . . 
[for those] . . . seeking financing" is, I think, sound. As your 
report indicates, however, banks are generally not in a position 
to risk their loan capital with new firms, except on a secured 
basis, and they are certainly never sources of venture, that is 
equity, capital. Banks can often, as the report notes, suggest 
alternative sources of capital, and we would support the position 
that additional information can be distributed to banks so that 
they may better advise their customers. 
We would not consider it appropriate, however, for your 
report to include a recommendation that 
. . a program of education be established within 
the Federal Reserve System by District Federal Reserve 
Banks to provide associated banks, whether federal or 
state chartered, with information on the characteristics 
of venture capital financing, available capital sources, 
financing techniques, and technological trends." 
The staffs of the Federal Reserve Banks are not equipped 
to carry out such a responsibility. The research departments at

the Banks do not ordinarily include specialists in small business 
financing, and the work of the educational and public relations 
staffs is focused on banking problems. Thus, the program you 
have in mind would Y2 outside our area of competence. 
We suggest, therefore, that the resources of the Small 
Business Administration and the field offices of the Department 
of Commerce be used to distribute such information; SBA field 
offices, as a part of their normal routine, already have con-
siderable contact with commercial banks throughout the country.

Mr. David Rockefeller,

The Chase Manhattan Bank,

Dear David: 
Thank you for your thoughtful letter of July 1 on the sub-
ject of Regulation Q as it relates to large denomination CD's. It 
raises many important issues which have to be, and are, continuously 
considered. 
A policy of monetary restraint, as you appreciate, will 
inevitably reduce the liquidity of financial institutions, corpora-
tions, and other sectors of the economy. The most desirable policy 
would be for all sectors to be restrained equally, or in proportion 
to their contribution to inflationary pressures. But given the 
institutional structure of the country, and the differing sensitivi-
ties of various groups to changes in credit conditions and costs, 
that is an ideal we can do no more than approach. 
In 1966 the housing industry bore the major, and undue, 
share of monetary restraint. 
So far this year housing has been less 
affected, although it is evidently in process of slowing down. The 
Principal thrust of additional inflationary pressures this year has 
come from the boom in business spending on plant and equipment. And 
under the impetus of inflationary expectations, high and sharply 
rising interest rates have appeared to be only a minor deterrent to 
businesses. 
Thus, it has been important to limit the availability 
of funds to businesses to finance spending. 
The pressure on bank liquidity, stemming in part from the 
maintenance of Regulation Q ceilings on large denomination CD's, has 
°f course limited the availability of funds from banks, particularly 

Mr. David Rockefeller

the major money market banks which have the widest contacts with the 
business community. As banks stiffen lending terms, some borrowers 
who do not-find accommodation will shift to the open market. But 
funds in the open market are by no means unlimited, especially in a 
period when the Federal Reserve is also reducing the funds it supplies 
through open market operations. Thus, businesses should find their 
own liquidity under pressure, and this will tend to constrain spending 
plans. 
We may be on the verge of having a real impact on inflationary 
psychology. This will be accomplished more rapidly to the extent that 
bank rationing of credit forces borrowers to curtail spending plans, or 
be forced into an unreceptive capital market. It would not seem 
prudent, at this time, to risk any reversal of this process. But as 
inflationary pressures are brought under control, it is likely that 
the liquidity constraints on banks and other key sectors of the economy 
will tend to abate. And the sooner inflationary psychology and spend-
ing are curbed, the sooner that desirable process of abatement can 
begin. 
Sincerely yours,
