Savings stamp vending machines. First Bank & Trust Company 
°°uth Bend. a State member bank of South Bend, Indiana, had 

12/20/67

requested through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago a ruling on 
whether a proposed plan to install and operate off-premises vending 
Machines to sell "savings stamps" would violate any provisions of 
the Federal Reserve Act or rules and regulations promulgated there-
under, and specifically whether the use of such machines would 
constitute the establishment of branches requiring the approval of 
the Board. 
A draft of reply prepared by the Legal Division expressed the 
°Pinion that operation of the plan would not appear to be prohibited 
by any provision of Federal banking law, that a "deposit" would not 
b e
 received at the location of the vending machine, and that the 
a
Pproval of the Board would not be required for the establishment of 
benches at the various locations of the vending machines. 
i" ?> 
Governor Robertson requested that the matter be held over 
because he was inclined not to agree with the proposed letter and 
0 1 1
 Id like to give further thought to the questions involved. 
Accordingly, it was agreed that the matter would be held over for 
c
°nsideration at another meeting of the Board. Governor Maisel sug-
gested that in the meantime the staff endeavor to find out whether 
Sll
ch vending machines were being operated by national banks and, if 
S
°> to what extent. 
Director appointment. Mr. Fauver referred to the recent 
A S
ion of the Board to appoint Mr. Norman F. Beach, Vice President

and General Manager of the Kodak Park Division, Eastman Kodak Company, 
Rochester, New York, as a director of the Buffalo Branch, Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, for the unexpired portion of the three-
year term ending December 31, 1968, and said it had developed that 
Mr. Beach was a director of a savings and loan association. 
However, 
the association was supported and staffed by employees of Eastman 
K°dak and did not do business with the general public. 
Board members observed that the savings and loan association 
a
Ppeared to function in effect as a company credit union and indicated 
that they would see no objection to continued service by Mr. Beach as 
a
 director of the association while serving as a director of the 
Buffalo Branch. However, one member (Governor Robertson) urged that 
the i a c k of objection in this particular situation not be regarded as 
the establishment of a general precedent. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
a t
tendance. 
Reserve requirements. In a memorandum dated December 19, 
a copy of which has been placed in the Board's files, the 
^
v
i s i o n of Research and Statistics noted that with prospects for 
fiscal restraint uncertain, with the domestic economy showing signs 
inflationary resurgence, and with the evident need to maintain 
c
°
n
fidence in the dollar internationally as well as domestically, the 
r a
 might want to consider an increase in reserve requirements as 

, 
4 3 0 2 
12/20/67

Part of a further move toward monetary restraint. Two alternative 
reserve requirement proposals were suggested: 
(a) an increase of 
half a percentage point in the requirement against total net demand 
deposits, or (b) an increase of half a percentage point in the 
requirement against net demand deposits in excess of $5 million at 
a
ny one bank. 
As to the timing of any action, it was suggested that a 
feasible set of dates, taking into account the Treasury financing 
schedule and other factors, would include an announcement toward the 
end of the calendar year and effective dates of January 11 and Janu-
a r
y 18, 1968, for reserve city and country banks, respectively. In 
v
iew of the probable Treasury financing schedule and patterns of 
reserve needs, it appeared that the next feasible effective dates 
w
°uld n o t come until late winter or early spring. 
The memorandum then discussed factors to be considered rela-
tive to the desirability, timing, and likely effects of reserve 
rec
iuirement action. 
There was a rather protracted general discussion at this meet-
based on the points covered in the staff memorandum, from which 
'•here developed to be unanimity of opinion on the desirability of 
^creasing reserve requirements effective on the dates suggested in 
ar
*uary. it w a s generally agreed, for reasons similar to those 
ited i n the staff memorandum, that the psychological or signal 

• 4903 
12/20/67 
-5-
effect of the announcement of such a move would be helpful, within 
the context of both domestic and international considerations. 
It 
w
as also the consensus that the action should not be regarded as one 
solely for psychological reasons but as one that would constitute in 
fact another move, though not of drastic character, in the direction 
o f
 further monetary restraint. However, the actual degree of impact 
to be exerted on bank reserve positions was believed not to be a 
question on which a final decision needed to be made at this time 
since the Federal Open Market Committee would meet on January 9, 
1968, prior to the effective dates of the reserve requirement increase, 
and a decision could then be reached on the extent, if any, to which 
it:
 would seem appropriate to moderate the effect of the increase 
through open market operations. It was the view of the staff that in 
the meantime there probably would be no necessity for a modification 
o f
 the current economic policy directive adopted by the Committee on 
M e m b e r 12, 1967, which called for operations with a view to moving 
lightly beyond the firmer conditions that had developed in money 
Markets, partly as a result of the discount rate increase in November. 
As 
to the timing of action to increase reserve requirements, 
announcement of such action, there was initially some disposition 
vi
-thin the Board to favor the taking of a vote today, with prompt 
°nncement thereof. This reflected an understanding that some 
a nt 1 
cl
-pation of an overt System move toward additional monetary 
straint already existed in the market, together with a view that 

. 4904 
12/20/67 
-6-
the timing was propitious from the standpoint of economic and related 
considerations, a feeling that member banks should be given ample 
time to make necessary adjustments, and the practical consideration 
that all members of the Board were present today, which it appeared 
would not again be the case until after the turn of the year. 
However, the Chairman indicated that for certain reasons, 
deluding the fact that negotiations were already in process looking 
toward the development of a strengthened U.S. balance of payments 
Program, he would consider it advisable to defer action for at least 
a
 few days, and members of the Board expressed their willingness to 
defer to the Chairman's judgment in that regard in light of consider-
a
tions such as those he had mentioned. 
As to the exact form in which the reserve requirement increase 
should be structured, there developed to be an even split in prefer-
ence between the alternatives suggested in the staff memorandum 
^ince Chairman Martin did not express a preference at this stage). 
Thr 
r e
e members (Governors Mitchell, Daane, and Sherrill) preferred an 
increase applicable to total net demand deposits. Individually or 
c
°Hectively, they expressed the view that this would be the cleaner 
m
°
Ve
» the view that the psychological effect of the action would be 
a x
imized if all member banks were affected, the thought that sacri-
*
C e
s required by the current balance of payments situation and 
l^ted circumstances should be shared by all, and an understanding 
thg excess reserves were lodged in the smaller banks to a greater 

. 4905 
12/20/67 
-7-
extent proportionately than in the large banks. While they were 
sympathetic to the objective of restructuring the system of reserve 
requirements in the direction of a graduation of such requirements, 
they believed it would be desirable to deal with that problem in and 
°f itself at the earliest opportune time rather than to make a 
gesture in connection with an action such as the one under considera-
tion that was being taken primarily for other reasons. 
Three members of the Board (Governors Robertson, Maisel, and 
trimmer) preferred to apply the increased requirement only to net 
demand deposits in excess of $5 million at any one bank. In their 
remarks they emphasized the problem of membership in the Federal 
Reserve System, particularly the burden of maintaining required 
r
eserves as it bore upon the small banks, with attendant incentive 
toward withdrawal from membership. They pointed out that the total 
•^Pact of the reserve requirement action, dollarwise, would not be 
lessened significantly if the action exempted the first $5 million 
demand deposits at any one bank, and they suggested that differ-
er
*ces in bank reserve management techniques as between the larger 
aric
* the smaller banks were such that the problem of adjustment to the 
r e
serve requirement increase would be more difficult at the small 
k^nks. Further, they doubted, in the light of past experience, that 
fundamental decision on restructuring the system of reserve require-
ment* 
c s
 could be expected to materialize in the near future, and 

, 4906 
12/20/67 
-8-
roeanwhile an opportunity to make a modest move in that direction 
would have been lost. 
Despite the preferences that were expressed, members of the 
Board indicated generally that they would rather compromise on the 
form of reserve requirement action than to have no action at all, 
0 r
 to have an action announced on less than a unanimous basis. 
There followed a discussion of possible procedural alterna-
tives, all with the purpose of allowing it to be stated, when an 
a
nnouncement was made, that the action was unanimous or at least one 
which all Board members concurred. The discussion was inconclu-
sive and it was understood that this aspect of the matter would be 
t a
ken up again at such time as the Board gave further consideration 
t o
 the proposed reserve requirement action, in particular the timing 
an announcement and the precise form of the action. 
The meeting continued from this point with staff attendance 
f u
rther limited. 
Balance of payments. Pursuant to previous understanding, 
p 
vernor Brimmer presented for discussion at this time the proposals 
his memorandum of December 18, 1967, (1) that the Board request 
U c , , 
banks with foreign branches to extend a larger share of their 
^°3ns to foreign borrowers through their branches rather than their 
offices, and (2) that the Board ask such banks to shift to their 
f o 
r e
ign branches a substantial share of the loans to foreigners cur-
er
*tly outstanding on head office books. 

. 4907 
12/20/67 
-9-
Governor Brimmer then turned to the question of possible 
suspension by the Board of the statutory requirement that the Federal 
Reserve Banks maintain reserves in gold certificates of not less 
than 25 per cent against Federal Reserve notes outstanding. 
On the latter point, Chairman Martin inquired whether any 
o f
 the members of the Board would not favor legislation to eliminate 
the gold cover, and it was indicated that the members were unanimously 
favor of such legislation. The view also was expressed generally 
that it would be unwise for the Board, on its own initiative, to 
suspend the gold cover requirement unless such action became necessary 
because the action might only complicate the situation and weaken the 
chances for enactment of legislation. Similarly, it was suggested 
that action on the gold cover probably should not be woven into a new 
^•S. balance of payments program and that it would be preferable to 
S e
ek legislative action independently of such program. 
With respect to the proposals set forth in Governor Brimmer's 
m e
morandum, it was noted that they would be essentially cosmetic. 
^°Pe was expressed that the balance of payments program now under 
C
°
ns
iteration within the Government could be so devised as to attack 
^ e problem of the payments position more fundamentally. However, it 
Va q 
suggested that the proposals Governor Brimmer had advanced should 
k e
p t under consideration as developments unfolded, perhaps for 
U x
H i a r y use in conjunction with announcement of a reformulation of 
he Board's voluntary foreign credit restraint program. 

12/20/67 
-10-
Governor Robertson then brought out that there must be placed 
in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury tonight a statement 
regarding 
steps that might be taken to tighten the guidelines of the 
restraint program administered by the Board, it being contemplated 
that a revision of the guidelines would be a part of the new over-
a
U balance of payments program. He described the nature of the 
revisions that he would have in mind proposing, the principal one 
keing a reduction in the guideline ceiling applicable to banks from 
109 per cent to 103 per cent of the 1964 foreign credit base. Within 
this limitation, he would continue to emphasize the priority of export 
C r
edits and credits to less developed countries. As to the part of 
the program applicable to nonbank financial institutions, he outlined 
^actors that would make it difficult to introduce revisions similar 
t° those being proposed on the bank side, but he indicated that he 
w
°uld have in mind increased consultation with companies by the Fed-
e r
al Reserve Banks to restrict the flows of credit, especially to 
j 
V e
loped countries, in an orderly manner. 
Governor Robertson went on to say that he would not be 
*
n c
lined to recommend even the steps he had mentioned, particularly 
s
 they were applicable to banks, unless there was assurance that 
e s
trictions of equal force were to be applied in other sectors. 
In 
connection, he referred especially to the direct foreign invest-
ment n 
Program administered by the Department of Commerce and expressed 
the v
iew that the restrictions thereunder should be tightened 

4909 
12/20/67 
-11-
• * 
significantly, for example with regard to acquisitions, if the banks 
were to be asked to live within severe additional limitations. 
Governor Robertson also referred to his disappointment con-
cerning the apparent failure to follow through on previous under-
standings with respect to curtailment of Export-Import Bank credits, 
which were outside the scope of the voluntary foreign credit restraint 
Program, and indicated that he would want assurance at this stage 
that the effect of any new steps was not merely to restrict loans by 
Private enterprise in order to let such loans be extended by the 
Export-Import Bank. 
Comments by other members of the Board were generally in 
S u
PP0rt of the steps Governor Robertson had outlined for revision of 
L n e
 guide1 ines applicable to banks and nonbank financial institutions 
and of the attitude he had suggested as appropriate in negotiating 
Within the Government. The overall tone of the comments was such as 
t o
 indicate that the Board members would not favor a substantial 
t
ightening of the bank program unless the Government's program pro-
ed for roughly similar limitations in other sectors. At the same 
t
^
ITlG
, however, if the total program did impose such limitations, it 
WQs " 
indicated that the Board would be prepared to go along with revi-
si n s
 on the bank side--and also on the side of the program applicable 
0
 Nonbank financial institutions, to the extent they could be worked 
out, 
""•at least as severe as those proposed by Governor Robertson and 
s
sibly a little stronger in certain respects. 

. 4910

At the end of the discussion Chairman Martin observed that 
Governor Robertson appeared to have the solid support of the Board 
his approach to the negotiations, and he was authorized to proceed 
accordingly.

Other members, while not disagreeing with the view that it

as important to put such a basic study in motion, emphasized the

The meeting then adjourned.

This change generally follows the form of the separate 
schedule, FR 105M, collected with the fall call except that 
advances under credit card plans are combined in a single item. 
Interest in this information extends across a broad area and 
• includes economists and financial analysts in the Federal Banking 
Agencies as well as members of the Congress and others interested 
in developments in banking. The two new call report items would 
also serve to benchmark the monthly consumer credit series which 
was revised to include similar items beginning with the December 
report.

Because of this change a revised tabulating card layout 
will be required for the call report. The revised card format 
and specific processing instructions will be sent at a later date, 
The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit 
insurance Corporation will use identical forms for national and 
insured nonmember banks. The separate Schedule B requiring infor-
mation by issue on holdings of U. S. Government and Federal Agency 
^ligations will also be collected. 
It should be noted that the 
reakdown on this Schedule and the related items on the face of 
he report does not center on whether the obligations are guaranteed 
not guaranteed but on whether they were issued by the U. S. 
Government or a Federal Agency.

Gentlemen: 
Tlie Director of the Division of Examinations, on behalf

 the Board of Governors under delegated authority, approves the 
establishment of a branch by Security Bank and Trust Company, 
Lincoln Park, Michigan, at the intersection of Eureka and Beech 
Daly

branch is established within six months from the date of this 
letter. 
In considering this application it has been determined 
that your bank's management is satisfactory, that the proposed 
branch would serve the convenience and needs of the community, and 
that e 
stablishment of the branch will not tend to create an undesir-
a
ble competitive situation. It is understood that plans have been 
formulated to strengthen your bank's capital position. 
Very truly yours,
