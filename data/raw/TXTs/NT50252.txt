Report on competitive factors. During discussion at the 
meeting on April 4, 1968, of a report to the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation on the competitive factors involved in the proposed purchase 
of assets and assumption of liabilities of The Evans Savings Association, 
Akron, Ohio, by The Barberton State Bank, Barberton, Ohio, question 
was raised regarding the advisability of allowing Transcontinental 
Investing Corporation, New York, New York, which controlled the savings 
association, to acquire an interest in the Barberton bank through the 
proposed transaction. The staff was directed to obtain additional 
information. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated April 5, 1968, 
from the Division of Examinations resubmitting the proposed report to 
the Corporation and suggesting that the Corporation be given the benefit 
of the information relating to Transcontinental Investing Corporation 
developed by the staff. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the transmittal of the 
report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the conclusion 
reading as follows:

Consummation of the proposed acquisition of The Evans 
Savings Association, Akron, Ohio, by The Barberton State 
Bank, Barberton, Ohio, would eliminate present and potential 
competition between them for time and savings accounts and 
mortgage loans. At the same time, the substitution of a 
full-service bank for the present savings association might 
stimulate competition in the areas currently served by 
offices of the latter institution. The overall effect on 
competition would be slightly adverse. 
Unanimous approval was also given to the transmittal of a 
letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation relating to the 
activities of Transcontinental Investing Corporation. A copy of the 
letter is attached as Item No. 4. 
Bancorporation of Montana. Memoranda from the Division of 
Examinations dated March 28, 1968, and other pertinent papers had 
been distributed in connection with applications of Bancorporation of 
Montana, Great Falls, Montana, to acquire shares of the following banks 
in Montana: (1) Pondera Bank of Montana, Conrad; (2) Eastside Bank 
of Montana, Great Falls; (3) The Peoples State Bank of Missoula; and 
(4) Valier Bank of Montana, Valier. 
The applications were approved unanimously, with the under-
standing that orders and a statement would be drafted for the Board's 
consideration and that the orders would include a requirement recommended 
by the Division. 
The meeting then adjourned. 

Secretary's Notes: A letter was sent today 
over Chairman Martin's signature to the 
Chairman of the Administrative Conference of 
the United States advising of the designation 
of Robert P. Forrestal, Assistant Secretary, 
to serve as the Board's representative to 
the permanent Conference. 
The requirements contemplated by the Board's 
action on March 7, 1968, in approving the 
issuance of a preliminary permit to Seattle-
First International Corporation, Seattle, 
Washington, having been completed, a letter 
was sent today to that corporation trans-
mitting a final permit to commence business. 
A letter was sent today to Bank of America 
National Trust and Savings Association, San 
Francisco, California, acknowledging receipt 
of notice of its intent to establish an addi-
tional branch in Ecuador, to be located in 
Quito. 
Governor Robertson today approved on behalf 
of the Board a memorandum recommending 
acceptance of the resignation of Robert J.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company 
of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, pursuant to the provisions of Section 
25 of the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Frankfurt, 
Germany, and to operate and maintain such branch subject to the pro-
visions of such Section and of Regulation M. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before May 1, 1969, all rights granted hereby shall 
be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted 
will automatically terminate on that date. Please inform the Board 
of Governors, through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, when the 
branch is opened for business, furnishing information as to the 
exact location of the branch. The Board should also be promptly 
informed of any future change in location of the branch in Frankfurt. 
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the form 
of allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as 
foreign assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. 
In view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 
investments on the balance of payments, the foregoing permission is 
given with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's 
operations maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained 
outside the United States. Accordingly, it is understood that the 
investment now being approved will be made within the guidelines 
established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect

Unless the branch is actually established and opened for

Governors, through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, when the branch

Gentlemen: 
This refers to the application from your bank, submitted 
through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for permission to 
maintain reserves on the basis required of banks not in reserve 
cities. 
Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act and the Board's 
Regulation D, issued under authority of that section, contemplate 
that all offices of a member bank shall maintain reserves on the 
same basis. After consideration of the information submitted and 
in view of the fact that Crocker-Citizens International Bank is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of a member bank required to maintain 
reserve city reserves and that it competes with reserve city banks 
in New York for international banking business, the Board of 
Governors believes that granting the request of your bank for per-
mission to carry reduced reserves would not be justified. Your 
request has, therefore, been denied. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to an application now pending before 
your Board involving the proposed purchase of assets and assumption 
of liabilities of The Evans Savings Association, Akron, Ohio, by 
The Barberton State Bank, Barberton, Ohio. 
It is noted in the application that Transcontinental 
Investing Corporation, New York, New York, through its ownership of 
Equitable Investment Corporation owns over 90 per cent of the shares 
of The Evans Savings Association, Akron, Ohio. 
In September of 1967, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System approved an application by Society Corporation, 
Cleveland, Ohio, a registered bank holding company, to acquire 
90 per cent or more of the voting shares of The Springfield Bank, 
Springfield, Ohio. During an investigation of this latter proposal, 
certain information regarding Transcontinental Investing Corporation 
was obtained, which information may be of interest to you during 
your consideration of the proposed acquisition of The Evans Savings 
Association by The Barberton State Bank. 
In 1965, Transcontinental Investing Corporation (TIC) 
acquired The Springfield Bank, Springfield, Ohio. Not long there-
after, TIC attempted to force Springfield Bank to accept discounted 
loans from other subsidiaries of TIC and customers of these subsidi-
aries. Management of Springfield Bank refused to accept such loans 
and relations with the owner became strained. The bank was also 
directed to place funds in correspondent banks chosen by TIC. Com-
mitments made at the time of the acquisition to increase capital were 
never realized although no cash dividend had been paid. Also, sub-
stantial management fees were charged by the owner. In 1967, control 
of The Springfield Bank was acquired by another group, thus terminating 
the relationship of the bank with TIC. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.
