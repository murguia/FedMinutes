Peoples Trust. After preliminary consideration of an application 
by Peoples Trust of New Jersey, Hackensack, New Jersey, for permission to 
merge with Fort Lee Trust Company, Fort Lee, New Jersey, the members of 
the Board present indicated that they were inclined toward approval of 
the application, with note being made, among other things, of the position 
taken by the New Jersey Banking Commissioner. However, in recognition of 

3733 
12/15/69 
-3-
the fact that diverse views existed, as evidenced by a negative recommen-
dation from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an opinion from the 
Department of Justice-that the merger would have a significantly adverse 
effect on competition in Bergen County, it was the consensus that action 
should be deferred until additional members of the Board could be present. 
In preparation for further consideration of the matter, the 
staff was requested to draft a statement that might be used in support 
of a decision to approve the application, and in that connection members 
of the Board mentioned certain points that in their view should be 
covered in the statement. 
In addition, Governor Brimmer asked that the 
staff prepare a paper setting forth the details with respect to the 
several factions of shareholders of Fort Lee Trust Company, along with 
a paper discussing the position taken by the Department of Justice on 
the competitive factors involved. 
Regulation Z. Section 123 of the Consumer Credit Protection 
Act required the Board to exempt credit transactions subject to State 
law from the disclosure and rescission requirements of the Federal truth 
in lending legislation if the Board found that the requirements of a 
particular State were substantially similar to the Federal requirements 
and it appeared that there was adequate provision for enforcement. Al-
though the Board had not yet granted any State an exemption, an applica-
tio n from the State of Maine had been published in the Federal Register 

12/15/69 
-4-
and applications from several other States were being reviewed by the 
Board's staff. 
The Division of Supervision and Regulation now recommended, 
however, that the Board publish for comment a proposed amendment to 
Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, that would preserve the right of con-
sumers to file civil actions in either Federal or State courts after 
the Board exempted, for individual States, certain credit transactions 
from the purview of the Federal legislation. Criminal and administrative 
responsibility with respect to exempted transactions would be left to 
State control. 
In today's discussion, question was raised whether in the 
circumstances it seemed necessary to take the time that would necessarily 
be involved in following the procedure of publishing the proposed amend-
ment for comment. While it was agreed that little purpose might be 
served, Board members concluded that on balance insufficient reason 
existed for failing to adhere to the practice normally followed in 
amending a Board regulation. 
The Board also addressed itself to a question, raised by the 
staff, whether it would be advisable to seek legislation clarifying the 
situation with which the Board was now proposing to deal under its regula-
tory powers. The general view was that the Board should proceed with the 
proposed regulatory amendment. 
However, some members suggested that 
consideration might also be given to including a legislative proposal on 

12/15/69 
-5-
this point on some occasion when recommendations were being made to the 
Congress concerning the truth in lending legislation. 
The Board then authorized publication of the proposed amendment 
for comment, with replies to be submitted not later than January 22, 1970. 
A copy of the press release issued with respect to the matter is attached 
under Item No. 1, along with a copy of the Federal Register document. 
With reference to the aforementioned application of the State 
of Maine for an exemption, Governor Brimmer reported having received the 
impression that the current Commissioner of Banks in that State was not 
sympathetic to the filing of the application, thus raising the question 
whether, if the exemption was granted, enforcement could be expected to 
be rigorous. 
It was understood that the staff would check on that point 
before the application was presented to the Board for decision. 
Certain management matters that had been scheduled for 
discussion today, but in which Governor Sherrill had a special interest, 
were held over for consideration at a meeting at which Governor Sherrill 
could be present. 
Chairman Martin joined the meeting at this point. 
Special Drawing Rights. On January 1, 1970, an initial 
allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR's) was to be made to members 
°f the International Monetary Fund. The United States was to receive 
around $900 million of such rights, to be credited to the account of 
the Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund. 

3736 
12/15/69 
-6-
There had now been received, for comment, a draft of a letter 
that would be sent by Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy to Chairman 
Martin with respect to the issuance of SDR certificates to the Federal 
Reserve. To aid the Board in its consideration of the matter, Mr. Solomon 
(Adviser to the Board) had supplied a memorandum under date of 
December 12, 1969, in which he recalled the legislative background relating 
to the issuance of SDR certificates, pointed out some of the implications 
of the issuance of such certificates, and mentioned certain questions 
that were raised by the draft letter. 
Two clarifying revisions in the draft letter were suggested 
by Mr. Solomon for transmittal to the Treasury. Subject to those 
revisions, the Board's staff was reported to believe that the principles 
laid down in the Treasury's draft letter represented reasonable conformity 
with the provision of the enabling legislation that specified that SDR 
certificates were to be issued to the Federal Reserve and remain out-
standing "only for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Special 
Drawing Rights or for financing exchange stabilization operations." 
Various aspects and implications of the proposed operations 
were explored by the Board quite extensively at this meeting. 
It was 
generally agreed that it would be desirable to transmit to the Treasury 
for consideration the two proposed revisions in the draft letter that 
had 
been suggested by Mr. Solomon. Also, although the draft letter 
would propose certain technical discussions between the Treasury and 

3737 
12/15/69 
-7-
the Federal Reserve at staff level, there was a view that it would be 
advisable for Chairman Martin, in replying to Secretary Kennedy, to 
suggest that prior to- the contemplated exchange of formal letters, 
Treasury and Federal Reserve representatives should meet to discuss 
the Treasury's intentions regarding the amount and purposes of issuance 
of SDR certificates 
in the first year, with the added assumption that 
such discussions would occur from time to time in the future as well. 
It was then understood that Chairman Martin would make such 
reply to Secretary Kennedy with respect to the draft letter as he 
considered appropriate in the light of today's discussion. 
A copy of the letter sent by the Chairman pursuant to the 
aforementioned understanding is attached as Item No. 2. 
Governor Mitchell withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
Retirement System. Against the background of the detailed 
progress report that he had presented in a memorandum of December 10, 
1969, and its attachments, Governor Maisel recommended that the Board 
take the following actions: 
1. Approve the substance of the revised Retirement Plan 
for Employees of the Federal Reserve System, as amended 
effective January 1, 1970, and the new Thrift Plan for 
Employees of the Federal Reserve System, effective 
January 1, 1970, subject to further consideration of 
changes that might be suggested by the Internal Revenue 
Service or others. Advise the appropriate bodies 
(Board of Trustees of the Retirement System of the 

12/15/69 
-8-
Federal Reserve Banks in respect to the Retirement 
Plan, and Conference of Presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks in respect to the Thrift Plan) that 
the Board was prepared to give approval to the 
final language when advice was received that the 
documents were in form acceptable to the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
2. Authorize the Conference of Presidents to proceed 
with the completion of contracts with insurance 
companies providing benefits in the event a member 
of the Retirement System died in active service or 
suffered long-term disability. This would include 
authorization for the execution of such contracts 
by Federal Reserve Banks when they had been approved 
by the Joint Board-Presidents' Conference Committee 
on the Retirement System as to substance, provided 
that the total cost was substantially consistent 
with the estimates that had been given to the Board 
on September 11, 1969. 
3. Advise the Board of Trustees of the Retirement System 
that the Board approved the use of a 4 per cent interest 
rate for all calculations under the Retirement Plan, 
effective January 1, 1970, if such rate was adopted by 
the Trustees pursuant to section 15.8 of the revised 
Plan. 
The actions recommended by Governor Maisel were taken by 
unanimous vote. 
Note: The Board of Trustees and the Conference of 
Presidents having proceeded, subsequent to this meeting, 
along the lines that had been contemplated, letters 
confirming the Board's actions were sent to the Chair-
man of the Board of Trustees and to the Chairman of the 
Conference of Presidents under date of December 30, 1969. 
Copies are attached as Items 3 and 4, respectively. 
Pursuant to the further recommendation of Governor Maisel, 
the Board voted unanimously to request the Joint Board-Presidents' 
Conference Committee on the Retirement System to proceed with studies 

3739 
12/15/69 
-9-
of (a) the administrative organization of the Retirement System, and 
(b) investment and reserve procedures for Retirement System funds, 
including the feasibility and desirability of purchasing annuities for 
retirees and prospective retirees from insurance companies. 
Note: This request was covered in the aforementioned 
letter to the Chairman of the Conference of Presidents 
of the Federal Reserve Banks dated December 30, 1969. 
Also upon the recommendation of Governor Maisel, the Board 
adopted a resolution relating to the Thrift Plan inasmuch as partici-
pation by employees of the Board was involved. A copy of the resolu-
tion is attached as Item No. 5. 
With respect to the foregoing resolution, Governor Robertson 
requested that the record reflect the fact that at an earlier meeting 
he had voted against the proposal that the Board contribute at the rate 
of 25 cents for each dollar contributed to the Thrift Plan by an employee 
up to a maximum of 1-1/2 per cent of the employee's salary. That con-
tinued to be his position. 
Governor Mitchell returned to the room at this point and the 
meeting continued with restricted staff attendance. 
Director appointment. 
It was agreed to ascertain through the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta whether F. Evans Farwell, 
President, Milliken and Farwell, Inc., New Orleans, Louisiana, would 
accept appointment, if tendered, as a Class C director of that Bank for 
the three-year term beginning January 1, 1970, with the understanding 

3740 
12/15/69 
-10-
that if it were found that Mr. Farwell would accept, the appointment 
would be made. 
Note: 
It having been ascertained that Mr. Farwell 
would accept, an appointment telegram was sent to 
him on December 22, 1969. 
It was understood that Chairman Martin would make informal 
inquiry with respect to the availability of an individual who had been 
suggested for appointment as a director of the Nashville Branch of the 
Atlanta Bank for the three-year term beginning January 1, 1970. 
All members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, and 
Johnson then withdrew from the meeting. 
Officer salaries at New York. Upon recommendation of the 
Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, the Board 
approved unanimously payment of salaries to officers of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York (except the President and First Vice President) 
effective January 1, 1970, at the annual rates shown in the attachment 
to the letter to the Bank of which a copy is attached as Item No. 6. 
Salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presidents. Upon 
recommendation of the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and 
Building Plans, the Board approved unanimously payment of salaries to 
the Presidents and First Vice Presidents of the respective Federal 
Reserve Banks (except Minneapolis), effective January 1, 1970, at the 
annual rates indicated in the letters to the Chairmen of the individual 
Banks of which copies are attached as Items 7 through 17, inclusive.

Agreement with Presidents. 
It was noted, in connection with 
the action taken in respect to the salary rates of the President and 
First Vice President-of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 
that increases were being granted effective January 1, 1970, even 
though the persons in question were nearing the end of their periods 
of service with the Bank. This was considered appropriate in view of 
relative salary levels and the quality of service that had been rendered. 
The discussion led, however, to a suggestion that a review be made of 
the terms of the standard agreement with Reserve Bank Presidents pro-
viding for supplemental retirement allowances in certain circumstances, 
it being felt that, for the future, there might be reasons to reconsider 
the provisions of the agreement under which the supplemental allowance 
was computed according to average salary over a period of years prior 
to retirement. 
It was agreed that such a study would be made. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Item No. 1 
iol immediate release. 
12/15/69 
December 16, 1969. 
The Bo£rd of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
issued for comment a proposed amendment to its Regulation Z that would 
Preserve the right of consumers to file civil actions in either Federal 
°r State courts ffter the Board exempts certain State credit transactions 
from the Federal Truth in Lending Act. 
Under Section 123 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the 
Hoard is requirec to exempt from the disclosure and rescission require-
ments of Truth ir Lending credit transactions subject to State law if it 
determines that the State requirements are substantially similar to the 
Federal, requirements and there is adequate provision for enforcement. 
If adopted, the proposed amendment woald leave criminal and 
administrative responsibility to State control with respect to exempted 
transactions. 
But the proposal would preserve the right of a consumer to 
seek redress for violations of State law in either Federal or State court 
and to avail himself of Federal or State rules of court procedure, in-
cluding those relating to class actions. 
Under the Act, a customer can collect from a creditor who 
folates the lav; civil penalties equal to twice the amount of the finance 
p i 
n°r£c (but in no case would he collect less than $100 or more than 
$l>°°0)> court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. 
The Board has not 
y e t granted any State exemptions from the Federal Truth in Lending Act, 
notice of receipt of an application from Mcine has been published in 
Federal Register. Applications from several other states are now 
reviewed for completeness by the Board's staff. 
Comments on the proposed amendment should be submitted to the 
B°ard not later than January 22, 1970. A copy of the proposal is attached.

TRUTH IN LENDING 
Exemption of Certain State Regulated Transactions; 
Proposal to retain access to federal civil remedies. 
Pursuant to the authority contained in the Consumer Credit 
Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1604), the Board of Governors is considering 
amending Part 226 in the following respects. 
Seetion 226.12 would be amended by revising paragraph (b) 
by adding a new paragraph (c). As ameaded, §226.12 would read 
as follows: 
• 226.12 gx(^aon_of^certain S ta t e r e j ^ u ^ 
(a) Exemption for State regulated transactions. 
In accordance 
the provisions of Supplement II to Regulation Z (§ 226.12 - Supple-
s t ) , any State m.iy make application to the Board for exemption of any 
c ass of transactions within that State from the requirements of Chapter 2 
o f the Act and the corresponding provisions of this part: Provided, That 
(1) Under the law of that State, that class of transactions is 
subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed under Chap-
tot 2 of the Act and the corresponding provisions of this part; and 
(2) There is adequate provision for enforcement. 
( b ) 
Procedures and criteria. 
The procedures and criteria under 
W h lch any State may apply for the determination provided for in paragraph (a) 
0 f this section are set forth in Supplement II to Regulation Z ( > 226.12 -
SuPPlement).

Civil Liability, 
Irt order to assire that the concurrent juris-
diction of Federal and State courts created in section 130(e) of the Act shall 
continue to h.ive substantive provisions to which such jurisdiction shall apply 
and generally to aid in implementing the Act with respect to any class oj' 
transactions exempted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Board 
Pursuant to sections 105 and 123 hereby prescribes that: 
(1) No such exemption shall be deemed to extend to the civil 
liability provisions of section 130 and 13*..; and 
(2) After an exemption has been granted, the disclosure 
requirements of the applicable State law shall be the disclosure 
requirements of this Act, and information required under such State law 
shall, accordingly, be the "information required under this chapter" 
(Chapter 2 cf the Act) for the purposes of section 130(a),

tllat that law is substantially similar to that o.-: the Act and that there is

a^ter the Board of Governors has exempted the class transactions as being

If the proposal is adopted, criminal and administrative, responsibil-
ity would be und'jr State control with respect to such exempted transactions. 
Sections 130 and 131 provide civil remedies for violations <>f the 
disclosure requirements of the Act. After an exemption based upon State law 
has been granted, that law will provide the applicable disclosure require-
ments, and violations of such requirements would be actionable under 3 3 
3-30 and 131. 
The customer would, therefore, retain the right granted 
by subsection (e) of 3 130 to seek redress for violations of such Stata law -
in either Federal or State court and to avail himself of the respective State 
or Federal court procedural rules. 
Paragraph (b) of > 226,12 would also be revised to indicate that 
Supplement II ( >226.12-Supplement) has been published, and to eliminate an 
obsolete reference to the date of the proposed publication. 
This notice is published pursuant to section 553(b) of Title 5.

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 262.2(a)). 
To aid in the consideration of this matter by the Board, interested 
Persons are invited to submit relevant data, views or arguments. Any such 
material should be submitted in writing to the Secretary, Board of Governors
