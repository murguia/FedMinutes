Litigation concerning interpretation. Mr. Frederic Solomon 
referred to a suit brought against the Board in Boston by a firm whose 
business had been affected by the interpretation issued earlier this 
year to the effect that the selling of instruments described as "deep 
in the money put and call options" would involve extension of credit 
for the purposes of the Board's margin regulations. 
In connection with 
the defense of the case, which was being handled for the Board by the 
Department of Justice, an affidavit had been requested setting forth 
certain factual background. 
Such a document had been prepared, and 
Mr. Solomon recommended its issuance by the Board's Secretary. 
After discussion the issuance of the affidavit was authorized. 
The meeting then adjourned.
