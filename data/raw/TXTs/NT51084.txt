Moody Foundation. The Board authorized issuance of an order 
reflecting its approval, on June 20, 1973, of the application of 
The Moody Foundation, Galveston, Texas, for an exemption from the 
provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act relating to prohibitions 
against nonbanking activities and acquisitions. A copy of the order 
is attached as Item No. 7. 
Collateral requirements of section 23A. Bank of Virginia, 
Richmond, Virginia, a State member bank and a subsidiary of Bank of 
Virginia Company, also of Richmond, had raised a question through the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond whether FHA mortgages were "obligations 
of the United States Government" for purposes of the collateral require-
ments of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In a memorandum of 

fo* >Â«J / 
7/12/73 
-5-
July 10, 1973, the Legal Division set forth reasons for its recommen-
dation that the Board conclude that FHA mortgages are not obligations 
of the United States for such purposes. A draft letter to the Reserve 
Bank was attached. 
The Legal Division's recommendation was approved unanimously. 
A copy of the letter so notifying the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 
is attached as Item No. 8. 
Republic National Bank of Dallas. On June 28, 1973, the 
Board determined that Republic National Bank of Dallas, a bank holding 
company and the largest bank in the Dallas banking market, was authorized 
to continue to engage in the activities of its six direct nonbanking 
subsidiaries other than the Howard Corporation (a trusteed subsidiary) 
under the "grandfather provisions" of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Announcement of that action had been held in abeyance, however, pending 
response by the bank to inquiries regarding minority interests held 
through Howard Corporation in 21 banks, including 18 banks in the 
Dallas SMSA. In view of a pending application for acquisition of 
Republic National Bank by a new holding company, the Board was concerned 
regarding the possible impact on banking concentration in the Dallas 
market if additional shares of these minority interests were acquired 
and the staff had been requested to ascertain from Republic National 
Bank which of these interests the new holding company intended to 
divest and which it intended to increase.

7/12/73

In a memorandum of July 6, 1973, Mr. Leavitt reported that 
representatives of Republic National Bank had indicated that the 
bank did not control the banks in which minority interests were 
held; that Republic National's preferred position was that the new 
holding company would make applications within two years for those 
minority-owned banks in the Dallas market that it wished to acquire 
and would agree to dispose of the rest within four years; that this 
program might be accelerated; and that, if required, it would make 
an attempt to designate those banks it hoped to acquire and those 
it probably would divest. 
Discussion at today's meeting indicated a general view that 
in the absence of a statement by Republic National Bank regarding 
its intentions with respect to the minority interests in banks held 
by Howard Corporation, the Board should not reach any determination 
regarding the bank's entitlement to grandfather privileges with respect 
to Howard Corporation. 
It was understood that Republic National Bank 
would be informed of the Board's position in this regard. 
Issuance 
of the determination regarding the six direct nonbanking subsidiaries 
was authorized. A copy is attached as Item No. 9. A letter was sent 
to Republic National Bank in the form attached as Item No. 10. 
Clearing agencies and transfer agents. The Subcommittee on 
Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 

*>trcKi 
7/12/73 
-7-
Affairs had requested the Board's comments on S. 2058, a bill to amend 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide for the regulation 
of clearing agencies and transfer agents. With a memorandum of July 10, 
1973, the Division of Supervision and Regulation submitted a draft 
reply that would take substantially the same position as the Board 
had taken in 1972 with respect to a substantially similar bill. The 
draft would endorse the bill as encompassing a sound administrative 
approach to the regulation of clearing agencies and transfer agents, 
since it would give the Securities and Exchange Commission authority 
to write regulations for the industry but leave enforcement and 
supervisory authority over banking institutions with the Federal bank 
supervisory agencies. The memorandum noted, however, that President 
Hayes and First Vice President Debs of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York felt strongly that the Board should have complete regulatory 
authority over clearing agencies that are members of the Federal 
Reserve System. They believed that since all existing depositories 
had been or were being chartered as limited purpose trust companies 
under State banking laws and were expected to apply for membership 
in the Federal Reserve System, any additional regulatory authority 
should more properly be vested in the Federal Reserve Board. The Banking 
and Securities Industry Committee took a similar view. 
In a memorandum of July 11, 1973, Governor Sheehan commented 
on the position advocated by the New York Reserve Bank and the Banking 

2600 
7/12/73 
-2-
and Securities Industry Committee, and indicated that he had suggested 
that the New York Reserve Bank be represented at today's meeting. 
After staff presentations that included comments by Mr. Waage 
of the New York Reserve Bank, expressions by members of the Board 
indicated that Governors Sheehan and Bucher believed that the rule 
Siting authority should be placed with the Board, while Governors 
Mitchell, Brimmer, and Holland were willing to accept the approach 
Proposed by the staff. However, it was suggested that, although that 
approach would contemplate that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
would write the regulations in consultation with the Federal bank 
supervisory agencies, it might be well to provide in the legislation 
for the concurrence of the appropriate bank supervisory agency prior 
to the adoption of any rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
applying to any clearing agency that is a bank. During the discussion, 
a n alternative draft of language for the letter was distributed to 
reflect the views that had been expressed, and further suggestions for 
revisions were made. 
At the conclusion of the discussion the Board approved, Governor 
sheehan dissenting, the sending of a letter in the form attached as 
Xtem_No. 11. 
First City Bancorporation of Texas. At the meeting on July 10, 
l9?3, the Board deferred action on the application of First City Bancorpo-
ration of Texas, Inc., Houston, Texas, to acquire shares of the successor 
b y merger to Northline. State Bank, also of Houston, pending exploration 

7/12/73 
-2-
of questions raised by Governor Bucher. The Division of Supervision 
and Regulation, which had recommended approval in a memorandum of 
June 22, provided additional information on the points in question in 
a memorandum of July 11. 
The Board unanimously approved the application and authorized 
issuance of an order reflecting this decision. A copy is attached as 
j^tem No. 12. 
Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado. In a memorandum of July 11, 
1973, the staff recommended approval of the application of Affiliated 
Bankshares of Colorado, Inc., Boulder, Colorado, to merge with First 
Colorado Bankshares, Inc., Littleton, Colorado. 
After discussion, the application was approved, Governor Brimmer 
dissenting on the grounds that the proposed acquisition would be anticompet-
itive. - It was understood that an order to implement this decision would 
b e prepared for the Board's consideration, and that a statement reflecting 
Governor Brimmer's dissent also would be prepared. 
Northwest Bancorporation. In a memorandum of July 10, 1973, 
the staff recommended conditional approval of the application of Northwest 
Bancorporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, to acquire shares of T. G. Evensen & 
Associates, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, the proposed conditions being 
contained in a memorandum of July 5 from the Legal Division. The Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had recommended denial. 
Discussion at today's meeting included comments by Mr. Burstein 
o f the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Ensuing expressions of view 

2602 
7/12/73 
-10-
disclosed divergent inclinations among members of the Board present, 
and action was therefore deferred until a time when additional members 
could participate. 
In a memorandum of July 2, 1973, the staff recommended approval 
of the application of Northwest Bancorporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
to acquire shares of Bettendorf Bank and Trust Company, Bettendorf, Iowa. 
The application was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that an order to implement this decision would be drafted for the Board's 
consideration. 
In a memorandum of July 2, 1973, the staff recommended approval 
of the application of Northwest Bancorporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
to acquire shares of Security State Bank, Keokuk, Iowa. 
The application was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that an order to implement this decision would be drafted for the Board's 
consideration. 
Truth in Lending Act amendments. Senator Proxmire had requested 
the Board's views on proposed floor amendments to pending legislation 
comprising the "Fair Credit Billing Act" and other additions to the 
Truth in Lending Act. With a memorandum of July 11, 1973, the Division 
Â°f Supervision and Regulation submitted a draft reply. Additional passages 
suggested for incorporation into the letter were distributed at today's 
meeting. 
The draft letter included a paragraph noting that it was now 
Proposed that the Board write regulations dealing with sex discrimination 

2603 
7/12/73 
-2-
in the granting of credit. The draft expressed the view that the 
question whether or not discrimination may have occurred in an 
individual extension of credit might be handled more appropriately by 
judicial determination than by general rule writing. During discussion 
at today's meeting, Governor Brimmer took exception to that passage, 
expressing the view that instead of leaving the matter to the courts, 
responsibility should be assigned to some Government agency as had been 
done with respect to other provisions of the Truth in Lending Act. 
After discussion, the letter was approved in the form attached 
a S lte_m No. 13. 
Restrictions on loans to affiliates. In a memorandum of July 5, 
the Legal Division explored the question whether, and in what 
eircumstances, a member bank may participate in (or purchase), without 
recourse, mortgage loans made or acquired by its mortgage banking affiliate 
without observance of the limitations and collateral requirements on loans 
t o affiliates set forth in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Attached 
to the memorandum was a draft interpretation, which the Division recommended 
b e approved by the Board in principle and referred to the Interagency 
Coordinating Committee on Bank Regulation before adoption. 
Discussion included a suggestion by Governor Holland that it 
wÂ°uld be helpful to have an analysis of the proposed position from 
a n economic point of view. Action was therefore deferred pending 
submission of such an analysis.

First National City Overseas Investment Corporation. Pursuant 
to the recommendation of the Division of Supervision and Regulation in 
memoranda of June 4 and July 11, 1973, the Board unanimously approved 
the application of First National City Overseas Investment Corporation, 
New York, New York, for prior conditional approval to acquire indirectly 
additional small loan companies in Puerto Rico. The Board also unanimously 
approved the sending of a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury of 
Puerto Rico, as suggested by the staff, responding to his adverse views 
Â°n the proposed acquisitions as expressed in a letter to Governor Brimmer 
an<l a subsequent telephone conversation. Attached as Items 14 and 15 are 
copies of the letter sent to First National City Overseas Investment 
Corporation and of the letter sent to the Secretary of the Treasury 
Â°f Puerto Rico. 
Reports of income and of condition. On March 13, 1973, the Board 
approved procedures for making available to the public annual Reports 
o f Income and quarterly Reports of Condition of State member banks. 
Although it was understood that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Planned to notify insured nonmember banks of specific requests for their 
rePorts and that the Comptroller of the Currency would furnish any national 
bank, upon its request, with a listing of requests for its reports during 
a given period, the Board had decided against a notification policy. In a 
memorandum of July 11, 1973, the Office of the Secretary cited circumstances 
l n support of its recommendation that the Board reconsider the earlier 

2605 
7/12/73 
-13-
notification decision and establish a practice of notifying State member 
banks routinely each time their reports are requested specifically by 
name of bank. If this plan were approved, it would be expected that 
the Federal Reserve Banks would follow the same procedure with respect 
to specific requests made directly to them. A draft letter to the 
Reserve Banks in this regard was attached. 
The Board unanimously approved the recommendation. A copy of 
the letter sent to the Reserve Banks is attached as Item No. 16. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Regulation Q. Subsequent to the meeting, available members of 
the Board reviewed and approved an interpretation of Regulation Q, 
Interest on Deposits, relating to the recent amendment regarding penalties 
for withdrawal of time deposits before maturity. A copy of the press 
release containing the interpretation is attached as Item No. 17.

r^bat;e. of any unearned portion of the finance charge. The Regulation 
Cu*rently requires those creditors who make rebates to identify the

UNITED CAROLINA BANCSHARES CORPORATION 
Â°rder Approving Acquisition of Prudential Credit Corporation of Sanford 
United Carolina Bancshares Corporation, Whiteville, North 
Carolina, a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding 
CÂ°ttpany Act, has applied for the Board's approval, under 5 4(c)(8) 
o f the Act and g 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y, to acquire-
directly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Credit Corporation, 
S h aUotte, North Carolina ("First Credit"), all of the assets of Prudential 
Credit Corporation of Sanford, Sanford, North Carolina ("Prudential"). 
rudential is a consumer finance company that engages in the activities 
^ making loans with a cash advance of $900 or less and acting as agent 
^ t h respect to credit life and accident and health insurance directly 
e^ated to an extension of credit. Such activities have been determined 
by 
Board to be closely related to the business of banking 
(l2 CFR 225.4(a)(1) and (9)(ii)(a)). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
rsons to submit comments and views on the public interest factors, has 
au-Ly published (38 Federal Register 14799). The time for filing 
c nts and views has expired, and none has been timely received. 
Applicant, the eighth largest banking organization in North . 
a rÂ°Una, controls three banks with aggregate deposits of $283 million, 

2613 
rePresenting 2.8 percent of the total deposits of commercial banks in 
State.!/ Applicant also controls four nonbanking subsidiaries one of 
Which 17-f 
i'irst Credit, is presently engaged in consumer finance company 
ct3-vities. First Credit (total assets of $769 thousand) is licensed under 
State ln 
^aw to make consumer loans with cash advances not exceeding $900. 
Â°Perates as a direct subsidiary of Applicant with offices in Shallotte 
a n d Wilmington, North Carolina.!/ 
Prudential (with total assets of $363 thousand) is a consumer 
^itiance company doing business through two offices located in Sanford, 
^Â°rth c arolina. Most of Prudential's business is derived from Lee County, 
arolina, although a slight amount of business is obtained from the 
^joining counties. Four other finance companies compete in the. 
Sarif0r' 
Q market; Prudential controls but 12 percent of the combined total 
assets of 
the finance companies in this market. 
Neither Applicant's banking subsidiaries nor First Credit 
located in the Sanford area, and it does not appear that 
ation of this transaction will eliminate any present competition.

Moreover, the presence of four other finance companies operating in Sanford 
^kes de novo entry into the market unlikely. 
Prudential also sells credit life insurance and accident and

applicant's acquisition of Prudential's insurance activities would have 
^ significant effect on either existing or potential competition. 
The financial condition of Applicant is satisfactory, but

Moreover, First Credit has operated at a profit for the past two

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I would disapprove the application by United Carolina Bancshares 
to 
acquire Prudential Credit Corporation. My decision is based on the 
0venant not to compete contained in the acquisition agreement, which 
E v e n t s Prudential's two owners from engaging in the finance company 
Usiness within a radius of 50 miles for a period of five years. For reasons 
stated more fully in my dissent to the Board's Order of April 26, 1973, 
Pptoving the acquisition by Orbanco, Inc., of Far West Security Company, 
it is 
rcy view that such covenants are inconsistent with the promotion of 
mPetition as required by the Bank Holding Company Act and should not be 
Sanctioned by the Board. 
The Board has a statutory responsibility to determine whether an 
^isition can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public. 
Plainly stated statutory responsibility, I cannot perceive how 
Public interest is served by approving agreements which, by their very 
t\atuxe 
Â» retard the development of competition and restrict entry into a 
busine

by individuals who should be free to compete if they so desire.

SOUTHWEST COMPANY 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
and Retention of Insurance Agency Activities. 
Southwest Company, Sidney, Iowa, has a p p l i e d for the Board's 
approval under Â§ 3(a)(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)) of formation 
o f a bank holding company through acquisition of 85.1 per cent or more 
o f the voting shares of Fremont County Savings Bank, Sidney, Iowa ("Bank"). 
At the same time, Applicant has applied for the Board's approval 
ur*er Â§ 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and Â§ 225.4(b)(2) of 
E l a t i o n Y to continue to engage in certain permissible insurance agency 
C i t i e s , to be conducted in Sidney, Iowa (population of less than 2,000), 
t h rÂ°u Sh the retention of Pullman Insurance Agency, Sidney, Iowa ("Agency"). 
operation by a bank holding company of a general insurance agency in 
a communit:y with a population not exceeding 5,000 is an activity that the 
BÂ°ard has previously determined to be closely related to banking (12 CFR 
225%4(a)(9)(iii)(a)). 
Notice of receipt of the applications has been given in accordance 
sections 3 and 4 of the Act, and the time for filing comments and 
has expired. The Board has c o n s i d e r e d the applications and all 
C 0^ents received in light of the factors set forth in Â§ 3(c) of the Act, 
arid the considerations specified in section 4(c)(8) of the Act. 
Applicant was o r g a n i z e d in October 1972, for the principal 
PurPose of becoming a bank holding company through acquisition of Bank, 
applicant's sole business activity to date has been the acquisition of 

2618 
-2-
the building presently occupied by Bank and the operation of Agency as 
a subsidiary of Applicant. 
Bank ($8.1 million in deposits) is the only bank in Sidney, 
a rural community. Bank controls 32.4 per cent of the total deposits 
n e i d by the seven banks in Fremont County and, on that basis, is the 
largest bank in the countyAcquisition of Bank by Applicant would 
n o t eliminate any existing competition, have an undue adverse effect 
11 a<*y other 
bank in the county, nor preclude the establishment of new 
bar*s in the area. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
* A p p l i c a n t and Bank are satisfactory and consistent with approval, 
^though Applicant will incur considerable debt in acquiring Bank, 
8 income from Bank and Agency will provide sufficient revenue to 
rvice the debt adequately.) Applicant proposes to increase Bank's 
Â§ricultural and commercial loans in the primary service area through a 
r e aggressive lending policyJJ Accordingly, considerations relating 
to the convenience and needs of the community to be served, with respect 
to the 
acquisition of Bank, are consistent with approval of the applica-
tion 
t*. 
J-t is the Board's judgment that consummation of the transaction 
b e in the public interest and that the application to acquire Bank 
S hÂ° U I d be approved. 
Agency operates a general insurance agency business out of an 
aajacent to Bank and is one of four insurance agencies in Sidney. 
^ ^ P ^ n k i n g data are as of June 30, 1972. 
e loan-to-deposit ratio (as of October 14, 1972) was 32.9 per cent.

Agency and Bank have been associated and under common ownership for a 
dumber of years. Retention of Applicant's insurance activities would 
er*able Bank's customers to enjoy the continued convenience of obtaining 
bar*king and insurance activities in conjunction with each other. There 
ig n 
n o evidence in the record indicating consummation of the proposal 
Would result in any undue concentration of resources, unfair competition, 
C o^licts of interest, unsound banking practices or other adverse effects 
the public interest. On the basis of the foregoing and other facts 
Elected in the record, the Board has determined that the considerations 
acting the competitive factors under section 3(c) of the Act and the 
al&nce of the public interest factors the Board must consider under 
Section 4(c)(8) in permitting a holding company to engage in an activity 
basis that it is closely related to banking both favor approval 
^ e Appiicant's proposal. 
Accordingly, the applications are approved for the reasons 
nttnarized above. The acquisition of Bank shall not be consummated 
the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
Â°rder, or (b) later than three months after the effective date of

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I would deny the application by Southwest Company to retain 
Oilman Insurance Agency. My decision is based on the existence of a 
cÂ°venant not to compete which prevents a principal executive (President 
o f Bank) and shareholder of Applicant from engaging in the insurance 
a8ency business within Fremont County for a three-year period following 
hig 
s leaving the employ of Applicant or any of its subsidiaries. For 
easons stated more fully in my dissents to the application of Orbanco, 
Inc 
â¢Â» co acquire Far West Security Company (59 Federal Reserve Bulletin 
369 (1973)), and the application of CBT Corporation to acquire General 
scÂ°unt Corporation (59 Federal Reserve Bulletin 471 (1973)), it is my 
Â°n that such covenants do not serve to promote competition as required 
t h e B a n k Holding Company Act and should not be sanctioned by the Board. 
Under the provisions of 5 4(c)(8), the Board is required to 
er^ine whether an acquisition of a nonbanking company can reasonably 
be e*Pected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible 
ftdvpy* 
S e effects. In view of this responsibility, I would deny this 
P l l c Q t i o n as contrary to the public interest.

FIRST CHICAGO CORPORATION

First Chicago Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, a bank holding

f o r the Board's approval, under section 4(c)(8) of the Act and Â§ 225.4(b)(2) 
f the Board's Regulation Y, to acquire all of the voting shares of AFSA 
a t a CorPÂ°ration9 Hawthorne, California ("AFSA"), a company that engages in 
activity of servicing student loans and other extensions of credit. 
activity has been determined by the Board to be closely related to 
t h e ^siness of banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(3)). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Petg0n s to submit comments and views on the public interest factors, has 
j 
Quly published (38 Federal Register 13062). The time for filing

approximately 
13 per cent of total deposits in commercial

others, loans and other extensions of credit primarily related to the 
fin 
ancing of post secondary education, and servicing such loans or 
tensions of credit. 
AFSA was incorporated in August, 1967, in California, to con-
U C t b u s iness as a servicer of student loans. AFSA has total assets of 
>000, and presently services a loan portfolio of approximately 141,000 
cÂ°unts in 19 states, although almost 70 per cent of the accounts are 
in three states, California, New York and Pennsylvania. 
Corporate 
^quarters are located in Hawthorne, California, and a service office 
ls Seated in New York City, New York. 
Although University Finance was granted permission to engage 
in the 
servicing of loans or extensions of credit, Applicant has stated 
in this 
aPplication that University Finance would not develop the capability 
to servi 
ice student loans but would subcontract this servicing to an agent. 
this 
aPplication is approved, Applicant intends that AFSA be the recipient

Batik Provides servicing for its student loan accounts, it cannot be con-
^nk' 
servicing operations are performed manually and solely for its own 
^CCoun t-
sÂ» whereas other student loan servicers are highlv computerized. Ae-
Â£iyÂ» consummation of the acquisition would not appear to have a signi-
fiCant effeet on existing competition. Applicant could enter the student 
siderec] a significant competitor in the student'loan servicing field since 

2624 
-3-
*Â°atl servicing business de novo, and thus, Applicant's acquisition of AFSA 
CÂ° U l d b e considered an adverse factor. However, this situation is mitigated 
V 
the low barriers to entry in this activity and the numerous servicers 
a l r e a dy i n the field, including Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) lenders, 
ducational institutions, regional services, and local and regional data 
prÂ°cessing companies. Further, AFSA is in need of additional capital, and 
PProval of the acquisition would improve AFSA's competitive capability 
~a~vis other national servicing organizations which are affiliated with 
nancial institutions. The Board concludes that the competitive considerations 
atg 
Â°nslstent with, and the public Interest factors lend some weight to, 
a P P t 0 V a l 
the application. 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that consummation 
Â°f the proposed acquisition would result in undue concentration of resources, 
UnÂ£ait 
competition, conflicts of interest, unsound banking practices, or 
Â° t h e r adverse effects. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations reflected

It appears that the proposed acquisition would not result in

THS i EJODY FOUNDATION 
Order Approving Exemption of Nonbanking Activities 
of Bank Holding Company 
The Moody Foundation, Calveston, Texas, a bank holding company

of 
Per cent of the voting shares of the Moody National Bank of Galveston, 
Galv 
eston, Texas, has appliad to the Board of Governors, pursuant to sec-
n 
of the Act (12 U.S.Co 1843(d)), for an exemption from the pro-
hibition* 
ot section 4 of the Act (relating to nonbanking activities of, and 
quisitions by, a bank holding company). 
Notice of receipt of the application was published in the Federal 
Agister o 
r on December 12, 1972 (37 Federal Register 26473), providing an 
Â°Pportuni-
ty for interested persons to submit comments and views with respect 
t o the Gr, 
^ 
application. Time for filing comments and views has expired and all 
received have been considered. No request for a hearing has been 
tecÂ«ived. 
Section 4(d) of the Act provides that, to the extent such action 
U l d not h 
Â°e substantially at variance with the purposes of the Act and 
8 ^ e c t to 
such conditions as the Board considers necessary to protect the 
b l t c inter 
rest, the Board may grant an exemption from the prohibitions 
secti 
Â° n 4 of the Act to a bank holding company that controlled one bank 
r to j u l 
0
 
u y 1, 1968, and has not thereafter acquired the control of any 
bank i 
' 
n o r der (1) to avoid disrupting business relationships that 
listed over a long period of years without adversely affecting the 

2630 
-2-
banks or communities involved, (2) to avoid forced sales of small locally 
Â°wned banks to purchasers not similarly representative of community 
Int-
erests, or (3) to allow retention of banks that are so small in rela-
t i o n t o the holding company's total interests and so small in relation 
to the banking market to be served as to minimize the likelihood that the 
Powers to grant or deny credit may be influenced by a desire to 
further the holding company's other interests. 
The Board has considered the application in light of the factors 
Set forth in section 4(d) of the Act, and finds that: 
Applicant is a charitable foundation established in 1942 by W. L. 
o r*, and his wife Libbie Shearn Moody, with the stated purpose to 
assist i 
m supporting activities that are directed toward improving the 
BGnetrai 
well being of the people who live in Texas. Applicant has invest-
*nterests in several nonbank companies, but its principal investments 
^ 
its 35 
per cent interest in the American National Financial Corpora-
tion 
r\ 
a Delaware corporation, owning 100 per cent of the shares of American 
A insurance Company, and (b) 51 per cent of the voting shares of 
^he Mooh 
oy National Bank of Galveston ("Bank"), Galveston, Texas. American 
a l Insurance Company ranks (as of December 31, 1971) as the ninth 
in size (in terras of insurance in force) and eleventh largest in 
i t h assets of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 1971) among stock life 
C e companies in the United States.

Bank was founded by 17. L. Moody, Jr., in 1907, and continued to 
b e controlled by Mr. Moody until his death in 1954. Upon his death, the 
Olltrol of Bank passed through his estate to Applicant, the estate being 
Settled in 1959. With deposits of approximately $38 million as of June 30, 
972Â» Bank is the third largest of the fourteen banks located in the Galves-
t 0 n Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, and holds about 12 per cent 
Of f.i 
t G aggregate deposits in commercial banks in that market. Bank appears 
t o be -j 
xn generally satisfactory condition, its management capable, and its 
prÂ°sPects good. 
The Board has found no evidence that the ownership and control 
of 
, 
oy W. L. Moody, Jr., or the Moody Foundation has had an adverse 
effect Â°n the Bank or the communities involved. Rather it appears that 
endeavors of Applicant in the areas of education, health,

fÂ°r its h 
nome office at Bank. Apparently, neither American National nor 
Applicant's other subsidiaries has borrowed from Bank. 
Although Applicant's income is derived from several sources, about 
6 2 Per cent of its gross revenues were derived (during 1971) from dividends 
^tom Am 
^erican National. During the same period, income from Bank accounted 
for 
y about 1 per cent of Applicant's total revenues. In addition,

the total assets of the Bank ($46 million) constitute (as of December 31, 
2.9 per cent of the total assets ($1.58 billion) of the companies 
ill Vi 
the holding company system. 
On the basis of the entire record, the Board concludes that the 
^siness relationships between The Moody Foundation and Bank have existed 
Â°ver a long period of years without adversely affecting the banks or 
LÂ°Bimunities involved; Bank is small in relation to the total interests of 
Th 
G Moody Foundation and it appears unlikely that Bank's powers to grant 
Â° r d e ny credit would be influenced by a desire to further Applicant's other 
Â°rests. Granting an exemption to Applicant would not be substantially 
at v^riance with the purposes of the Act nor adverse to the public interest; 
nd an exemption is warranted under the provisions of section 4(d) of the 
ct* Accordingly, an exemption pursuant to section 4(d) of the Act is 
G*eby granted subject to the condition that this determination may be 
evoked if the f a cts upon which it is based change in any material respect. 
Urther, the provision of any credit, property, or service by the Regis-

William D. Martin, III, Esq. 
Assistant General Counsel 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 
Richmond, Virginia

Dear Mr. Martin: 
This refers to your inquiry concerning the application of 
the second paragraph of Â§ 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to trans-
actions involving Bank of Virginia and Commonwealth Mortgage Company, 
both subsidiaries of Bank of Virginia Company (formerly Virginia Common-
wealth Bankshares, Inc.), a registered bank holding company. It is 
understood that Bank of Virginia makes loans to Commonwealth Mortgage 
Company, taking FHA mortgages as collateral on such loans. Bank of 
Virginia contends that FHA mortgages are "obligations of the U.S. 
Government," and that the second paragraph of Â§ 23A (relating to 
collateral on the. loans by a member bank to its affiliate) would 
Permit the bank to make loans to the mortgage company on the collateral 
of FHA mortgages equal to the aggregate outstanding principal balance 
of such mortgage loans. 
The Board has considered the question presented and concurs 
in the view of the counsel at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that 
the FHA mortgages are not obligations of the United States Government 
for purposes of the collateral requirements of Â§ 23A. In taking this 
action, the Board noted, among other facts, that neither the Federal 
Housing Administration nor the Treasury Department regards such mortgages 
as U.S. obligations. Rather than being an obligation of the U.S. Govern-
ment, an FHA insured mortgage represents a potential claim on (depending 
on the type of mortgage insured) one of the four mortgage insurance 
funds established pursuant to the provisions of the National Housing 
Act, Furthermore, the primary obligation for the payment of such 

2635 
William D. Martin, III, Esq. 
Mortgages rests with the mortgagor and not the United States Government. 
Only in cases of default and after following the detailed claim pro-
cedures, does the holder of an FHA insured mortgage have recourseânot 
to the U.S. Treasuryâbut to one of the insurance funds. 
Please advise Bank of Virginia of the Board's conclusion in 
this matter. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Chester B. Feldberg

Notice of the Board's proposed review of grandfather 
Pr*vilege3 of The Republic National Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, and 
a U Â°PPÂ°rtunity for interested persons to submit comments and views or 
request a hearing, has been given (37 F.R. 22414). The time for filing 
cÂ°mments, views, and requests has expired, and all those received have 
b e e n cÂ°nsidered by the Board in light of the factors set forth in Â§ 4(a)(2) 
Â°f the Act. 
On the evidence before it, the Board makes the following findings. 
T h e RePublic National Bank of Dallas, ("Registrant"), Dallas, Texas, 
be 
Caine a bank holding company on December 31, 1970, as a result of the 
l97n 
â^ 
Amendments to the Act, 
by virtue of Registrant's indirect ownership 
of 
per cent of the voting shares of Oak Cliff Bank and Trust Company 
("B ii 
ank'), Dallas, Texas (assets of about $96 million, as of December 31, 
197Q\ 
}* Bank, control of which was acquired by Registrant in 1929 had 
Â°tal deposits of approximately $94 million as of December 31, 1971, 
Renting less than 2 per cent of the total deposits in commercial 
i T ^ h â -
t*oli 
B o a rd' s action herein is based on Registrant's claim that it con-
Co 
only one bank on June 30, 1968, and therefore became a bank holding 
of 
covered by the Bank Holding Company Act as a result of the enactment 
int
 
e 1970 Amendments to the Act. The record shows that Registrant has 
Â£ t o^ r e s t s in each of 21 other banks ("minority" banks), interests ranging 
^ to 24,98 per cent. The action herein does not constitute a deter-
Â° n by the Board that any of the minority banks is or Is not, or may 
that*110 
a s u b sidi a ry 
Registrant. Nor does the action herein indicate 
Of . the Board would in the future permit Registrant to acquire, directly 
ovet,n<J^rectly, any additional shares of any of said minority banks. More-
App, the action herein does not preclude the Board from determining that 
itie^j, C a n t exercises control of, or a controlling influence over the manage-
Act Â° r policies of, any of said banks within the meaning of Â§ 2(a) of the 

2638 
-3-
banks in the Dallas banking market, and is the seventh largest bank in 
a t market. Bank's management, financial condition, and prospects are 
re8arded as satisfactory, and the Board has found no evidence of unsound 
b a n k i n 8 practices. 
Registrant, a national bank with total assets of $2.6 billion 
a s Â°f December 31, 1970, is the largest banking organization in Texas, 
aild t h e largest of 118 banks in the Dallas banking market. Registrant has 
ePosits of $1.8 billion, representing about 28 per cent of the deposits in 
0nimercial banks in the Dallas market and about 6 per cent of such 
ePÂ°sits in the State." 
Together with its banking subsidiary, Regis-
tt" 
11 controls deposits of $1.9 billion, representing about 29 per cent 
of 
deposits in Dallas and 6.3 per cent of the total deposits in the 
State. 
Registrant has six wholly-owned nonbanking subsidiaries: 
(1) 
P u b U c International Company, Dallas, Texas, an Edge Act Corporation 
in May, 1968; (2) Republic Computer Corporation, Dallas, Texas, 
0lnPany that apparently was acquired in March, 1969 and provides data 
PtoceqeM 
Â°t>ing services to commercial banks; (3) Republic National Corporation, 
min8ton, Delaware, a company that was acquired in February, 1964 and 
registrant's banking premises; (4) Medipark, Inc., Dallas, Texas, a 
compa y that was acquired in August, 1969 and owns and operates a parking 
Sata<> 
g e for Registrant's employees and customers; (5) Republic Small Business 
ment Company, Dallas, Texas, a small business investment company 
in May, 1961; and (6) Livingston, Inc., Dallas, Texas, a company 
that xi 
a s acquired In April, 1955 and owns title to a building adjoining 
ePÂ°sit data are as of December 31, 1971, unless otherwise indicated.

Re8istrant's offices. A subsidiary that was acquired after June 30, 
does not provide a basis for entitlement to grandfather benefits. 
Ho 
Â®Ver, each of the six subsidiaries is directly owned by Registrant, 
a National bank. Accordingly, on the basis of Â§ 4(c)(5) of the Act and 
Â§ OOr 
zL> 
^5'4(e) of the Board's Regulation Y, 
Registrant need not rely on 
Â§randfather privileges under the proviso in Â§ 4(a)(2) for authority to 
cÂ°ntinue the activities of the six direct subsidiaries. 
In addition to its direct subsidiaries, Registrant is deemed to 
cÂ°ntrol, by virtue of Â§ 2(g)(2) of the Act, the Howard Corporation, a 
steed affiliate of Registrant. Through the Howard Corporation, Regis-
trant -i 
reportedly engaged in dealing in securities; in activity involving 
oil 
* 8as, and mineral exploration and development; and In certain real 
e activity. The Board has currently under consideration and review 
the 
question of Registrant's entitlement to grandfather privileges with 
e 
under 
PGct to these activities and whether termination should be required 
the criteria set forth in Â§ 4(a)(2) of the Act, and a determination 
n that question will be issued in the future.

"shar
 
l 0 n 4(c)(5) of the Act permits a bank holding company to acquire 
nat^o
es which are of the kinds and amount eligible for investment by 
hanking associations under the provisions of section 5136 of the

activities of its six direct subsidiaries described herein.

The Honorable Harrison A. Williams, J] 
^airman 
Subcommittee on Securities of the 
Senate Committee on Banking, 
housing and Urban Affairs 
United States Senate 
Washington, D..C. 20510 
^ar Mr. Cha irman: 
I am writing in response to your letter of June 29, 1973, 
l n v/hich vou invite the comments of the Board of Governors on 
SÂ« 2058, which appears to be substantially similar lo legislation 
Passed by the Senate last year. 
Under the arrangement in S. 205S. the Securities and 
Exchange Commission is authorized to prescribe rules relating to 
c r i n g agencies (defined to include depositories) and transfer 
aÂ§ents. Enforcement authority respecting the application of such 
J-ules to such institutions which are banking organizations (banks, 
nk holding companies and subsidiaries thereof) is lodged in the 
three Federal bank supervisory agencies: the Comptroller of the 
Currency in the case of national banks, the Federal Deposit 
insurance Corporation in the case of State ncnmember insured banks, 
and the Federal Reserve in the case of State member banks, bank 
olding companies, and nonbank subsidiaries thereof. Clearing 
^agencies and transfer agents which are not banking organizations 
be subject to the enforcement jurisdiction of the SEC. 
The Board feels that the provisions of the bill requiring 
cÂ°nsultation and cooperation among the agencies responsible for 
Ministering the legislation are of great importance. The function 
acting as a clearing agency (depository) is being carried out by 
ePository Trust Co., which is chartered as a bank, and is a member 
ank of the Federal Reserve System. It seems most probable that 
p 0 s t other depositories will similarly be State member banks of the 
Gderal. Reserve System, and, as such, subject to examination and 
Â®uPervision bv the State chartering authority and the Federal Reserve 
Â°cause of these unique features of- the developing clearing agencies 

*>i* * *> 
The Honorable Harrison A. Williams, Jr.

(depositories), the Board believes that more widespread utilization 
of such institutions will be made if the rules governing clearing 
agencies (depositories) are the product of a joint effort by the 
SEC and the bank regulatory agencies. Although we regard the 
assignment of joint responsibility for rule-writing to more than 
one Federal agency to be generally disadvantageous as a regulatory 
procedure, we believe that the public acceptability of bank clear-
ing agencies (depositories)--which is vital to success of the entire 
progratn--wil1 be enhanced by providing for the concurrence of the 
appropriate bank supervisory agency prior to the adoption of any 
rule by the SEC applying to any clearing agency (depository) which 
is a bank. 
S. 2.058 appears to authorize the adoption of reasonable 
rules setting standards relating to the financial condition and 
character of a prospective participant in any clearing agency 
(depository). Since the matter oi; integrity is so important in the 
carrying on of the clearing agency (depository) function--a function 
which is essentially fiduciary in natureâwe believe that the proposed 
legislation should clearly authorize the adoption of reasonable rules 
relating to denial of participation in any clearing agency (depository) 
based upon adverse financial or character factors. 
I trust these comments will prove helpful .to ycu, and we are 
enclosing for your consideration several suggestions for technical 
amendments relative to the proposed legislation. The Board appreciates 
Having had the opportunity to comment on proposed S. 2058. 
Sincerely yours, 

' W G - 1 1 
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 
Proposed Amendments to S. 2058 
(A) On page 27, line 11, paragraph (i) should be amended to 
read as follows so that (1) the powers encompassed in the Financial 
Institutions Supervisory Act will apply to both clearing agencies and 
transfer agents and (2) temporary orders may issue under that Act 
to prevent prejudicing the interests of any person affected, and not 
merely depositors: 
"(i) Compliance with the requirements imposed by this 
section and section 17A of this Act may be enforced under 
section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 UcSÂ«C, 1818) 
by the appropriate regulatory agencies other than the 
Commission. For the purpose of the exercise by the appropriate 
regulatory agency of its powers under section S of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, any State member bank of the Federal 
Reserve System, including each subsidiary thereof, and any 
bank holding company and nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding 
company, acting as a clearing agency or as a transfer agent, shall 
be considered an insured bank. Any violation of any requirement 
imposed under this section or section 17A of this Act upon banks, 
bank holding companies, or nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding 
companies registered as transfer agents or clearing agencies is 
a violation of the requirements imposed under the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act and shall constitute adequate basis for the 
issuance of orders under section 8(b) and 8(c) of that Act: and 
for the purposes of this sentence the reference in section 8(c) 

2 6 4 5 
- 2 -
to "depositors" shall be deemed to include"a 11 persons doing 
business with a transfer agent or a clearing agency. In 
addition to its power under section 8 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act, each of such appropriate regulatory agencies 
may, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with this 
section or section 17A of this Act or any rule thereunder, 
exercise any other authority conferred on it by law." 

.. 2646 
(B) In order to permit participant banks to purchase stock 
in depositories as is now required of all participants in Depository 
Trust Company, Section 5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 USC 24) 
should be amended by adding the following provision: 
"Tenth. Notwithstanding any other provision in this 
section, to acquire or hold shares of stock or obligations 
issued by a corporation engaged solely in the functions of 
a 'clearing agency' as defined in section 3(a) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934."

a r e a overlaps that of only one of Applicant's subsidiaries, First 
C i ty national Bank, a large downtown wholesale institution located 
Â° V e r s i x miles from Bank. Due to its small size and its distance 
fr 
downtown Houston, Bank is not regarded as a desirable vehicle 
Ioy* entry into the Houston banking market. Moreover, Bank and 
APPlicant are affiliates, since shareholders owning 58.34 per cent

Board considers that consummation of the proposed acquisition 
not adversely affect competition in any relevant area to any

The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its

withstanding that after such act or omission has 
occurred, such Act, rule, regulation, or .interpre-

judicial or other authority to be invalid for any

identical to alternative 1, adds the following 
sentence.] Any act done or omitted in conformity

the preceding sentence shall not subject the

As you know, section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. Â§ 1604) gives the 
Â°ard broad authority to promulgate regulations "to effectuate the purposes 
the Act], to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate 
compliance therewith." Pursuant to this authority, the Board has Issued 
rÂ°ad-ranging regulations to implement the Act, as well as numerous formal 
,l
nterPretations of these regulations. Many of these rules make 
classifications," "differentiations" and "adjustments" to the Act's provi-
f,xÂ°ns as permitted by the section 105 authority so that there may be a 
^cÂ°nflict" wxth the literal language of the statute. Some of these rules have 
Â°en challenged by the courts. The Board in recommending the original "good 
aith reliance" provision merely wished to protect those creditors from 
liability who had followed these rules in good faith in the event 
*at a court might hold that the regulatory provisions were invalid for some 
eason. 
k 
In the proposed new language, various references to "the Act" have 
added to the Board's suggested provision. This change considerably 
ofÂ°adens the concept of the provision beyond the simple equitable protection 
those creditors who have followed the Board's regulations in good faith. 
e insertion of the references to the Act could, in fact, be used as an 
â Sumcnt by a creditor that it could ignore any of the "classifications," 
v
 Iiferentiations" or "adjustments" made by the Board in Regulation Z to pre-
t.Jni: evasion or to carry out the purposes of the Act. A creditor could argue

The new version absolves any creditor from civil liability for 
ailure to comply with Truth in Lending where that creditor has acted "in 
conformity with any reasonable interpretation of a significant ambiguity 
n> or significant conflict between, said Act, rules, regulations, or 
interpretations". 
To our knowledge, such a provision, which offers a 
Jjroditor as many different alternatives to compliance as might be 
reasonable", would be unique to Federal law. While undoubtedly submitted 
tn the laudable motive of preventing frivolous law suits which 
fortunately have occasionally characterized the history m Tv-M-, i n 
^ending)} i n the Board's view such a provision could make the successful 
â¢ln8ing of a civil suit for violation so difficult as to effectively bar 
y civil remedy. 
This, in turn, could encourage a cavalier approach to 
C0*Pliance. 
A function of the regulatory process is to clarify ambiguities, 
att- t h G B o a r d h a s> throughout the four years of Truth in Lending, continually 
^ ornptod to refine and simplify the various requirements of the law. Most

^bstitiutc for Relation to State Laws Scction 
This proposal would amend section 111 of the Act to require 
e Board to determine when State laws may be inconsistent with Federal 
.aws> b u t would circumscribe that process by specifying that a State lav; 
s not inconsistent where it gives greater protection to the consumer. 
*P-posal is as follows with underlining indicating the proposed 
d "iticn to the present statutory language: 
This title does not annul, alter, or affect 
or exempt any creditor from complying with, the laws 
of any State relating to the disclosure of informa-
tion in connection with credit transactions, or with 
respect to credit billing practices, except to the 
extent that those laws are inconsistent with the 
provisions of this title or regulations thereunder, 
and then only to the extent of the inconsistency, 
j-hc Board is authorized to determine whether such 
inconsistencies exist. The Board may not determine 
that: any State law is inconsistent with any provision 
of this Chapter if the Board determines that such law 
gives greater protection to the consumer. The Board 
shall by regulation exempt from the requirements of 
Chapter 2 or Chapter 4 any class of credit transactions 
within any State if it determines that under the J.aw of 
that. State that class of transaetions is subject to 
requirements subs tan rial jLv similar to those imp osed 
under these chapters or tiiat such 1aw gives greater 
El-P-toctlon to the consumer, and that there, is adequate. 
j 
jvrovision for enforcement. 
r e v i 
The Board questions whether it is truly necessary to have it 
to r T a 1 1 o f t h G v a r i o u s credit laws in the 50 States on a continuing basis

creditor to creditor are computed on the same basis and are made according 
t o the same standards. 
However, the proposal would apparently encourage 
a n d sanction State disclosure laws, as well as billing practice restrictions, 
vhich may have standards at variance with the Federal requirements. 
For 
Sample, a particular State might deem it greater consumer protection to 
require that all real estate closing costs be included in the finance charge 
and the annual- percentage rate. 
If a variation of that type was held not to 
ke inconsistent with the Federal law by virtue of this proposed language, 
disclosures made pursuant to that State law would not be comparable with the 
federal disclosures. Moreover, in the area of credit billing, there would 
be serious question as to whether a particular law, taken as a whole, gives 
greater protection to the consumer. 
For example, would a State law which 
Prohib its minimum charges, but sanctions the previous balance method, 
rePresent greater or less consumer protection than a Federal law which pro-
hibits the previous balance method but authorizes minimum charges? With 
respect to limitations on the holder-in-due-course doctrine, is a State law 
vbich allows consumers to raise defenses with card issuers where the trans-
ition is more than $25 and made within 50 miles of the consumer's residence 
mÂ°re or less protective than one where the limits are $50 and 100 miles? 
The above comments are equally applicable to the proposed last 
Sentence which appears to be a substitute for the present section 123 of the 
ctÂ» 
Such a provision would destroy the uniformity of nationwide disclosure 
ynder the State exemption procedure which presently requires a State to have 
Substantially similar" State requirements in order to qualify for an 
exemption. 
, 
With exception of the addition of the technical language to 
armonize section 111 with the addition of the credit billing provisions, the 
Â°nrd recommends against the proposal. 
It does suggest consideration of the 
Â°Uowi.ng alternative language, to the present section 111(a) to more clearly 
Seclude unfair conflicts between State and Federal law: 
This Title exempts any creditor from complying 
with the laws of any State relating to the disclosure 
of information in connection with credit transactions, 
or with respect to billing practices, to the extent 
that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions 
of this Title or regulations thereunder. 
Am 
^endment to Business Use, of Credit: Cards Section 
s 
As we understand the proposal, it would be an addition to 
f
e^ti 0 n ]35 a s i t appears in S. 2101 so that the section would read as 

tfhe Honorable William Proxmire 
-6-
Â°653 
The provisions of section 104(1) shall not apply 
to sections 132, 133 and 134, except that any business 
or other organization which provides credit cards to 
more than 10 of its employees to be used for the pur-
P_oses described in section 104 (1) shall be liable for 
any 'charges exceeding $50 which result from the un-
authorized use of such credit cards. 
The apparent intent of the provision is to exclude credit cards 
ssued to certain businesses from the limits on liability for unauthorized 
U S e of cards in section 133 of the Act (15 U.S.C. Â§ 1643). We see several 
Problems with the proposed language of this provision. Under this language, 
a Federal law would appear to impose unlimited liability for unauthorized 
use of credit cards while, by contract, such liability has traditionally 
limited to loss prior to the time the cardholder has notified the card 
sSuer of the loss or theft of his card. It appears questionable whether 
*ecieral la w should disturb these contractual provisions. Moreover, as we 
read this language, an organization which provides a single credit card of 
issuer to a single employee will lose the benefit of the protection as 
as some credit cards, perhaps of other issuers, are provided to ten 
. its employees. We also question what protection an employee-consumer 
^ght have against an employer passing to him full responsibility for the 
UnHmit.ed liability for unauthorized use. 
Slih 
^^J:JLLute for Cash Discounts Section 
The proposal would provide that card issuers may not prohibit 
" J-l&rs from offering discounts to cardholders to induce the cardholder to 
iia ^ 
cas^> check or similar means rather than using a credit card, or for 
PÂ°sing an additional charge at the time of sale for accepting a credit 
as payment. Such charges or discounts would be excluded from the 
^ UatlCe charge without limit. Any such discount or additional charge would 
dioG t o 
offered to or imposed on "all prospective buyers" and must be 
ty SciÂ°sed to all such buyers in accordance with regulations of the Board. 
assunie that "all prospective buyers" means only those buyers who present 
^ t cards for use in payment. Any other construction could encourage a 
Plicated dual pricing system of questionable general benefit. 
The provision would also specify that any such disccunt or 
shall not be deemed interest, finance charge, service charges or 
c^rges under the terms of any State usury, 
is-G a C t o r s i m i l a r statute. Such a provision, of 
Xs 
and 
re t a i I er ins t a linen t 
course, raises profound 
Â® U e s of appropriate State versus Federal areas of legitimate interest 
should be approached with caution.

S i n c e L h i s Provision has the effect of allowing a creditor to 
Snore a charge which is, in effect, a finance charge, the Board believes 
at it should be very narrowly drafted, particularly since it is designed

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of April 23, 1973, the Board 
Â°f Governors grants consent for your Corporation ("FNCOIC") to con-
tinue to hold the shares of Prestamos Prestos Puerto Rico Inc. 
("PPPR")j Puerto Rico, after PPPR acquires all of the stock of any 
additional small loan companies ("SLC") in Puerto Rico, the invest-
ment in each such company not to exceed approximately $900,000, and 
the total investments in such companies not to exceed approximately 
$2 ,000,000, provided the shares are acquired before December 31, 1974. 
The Board's consent to the proposed purchase and indirect 
folding of shares of SLC by FNCOIC is granted subject to the follow-
ing conditions: 
(1) That FNCOIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in SLC if SLC at any time fails 
to restrict their activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act 
could, with the consent of the Board of Governors, 
purchase and hold stock, or if SLC establishes any 
branch or agency or takes any action or undertakes 
any operation in Puerto Rico or elsewhere, in any 
manner, which at the time would not be permissible 
to FNCOIC; 
(2) That, when requested by the Board of Governors, 
FNCOIC will cause SLC (a) to permit examiners ap-
pointed by the Board to examine SLC, and (b) to fur-
nish the Board with such reports as it may require 
from time to time; 

265.9 
First National City Overseas 
Investment Corporation 
-2-
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by SLC 
be reported under Section 211.3(d) of Regulation K 
in the same manner as if SLC were a corporation or 
ganized under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve 
Ac t; and 
(4) That FNCOIC shall not carry on its books the shares 
of SLC at a net amount in excess of its proportionate 
share of the book capital accounts of SLC, after 
giving effect to the elimination of all known losses. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisitions, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Sank of New York, with copies of Articles of Association, Memorandum 
of Association, and By-Laws of SLC. 
The foregoing consent is given on the condition that the 
investment will be made within the Foreign Credit Restraint Guidelines 
as they apply to First National City Bank and its affiliates. 
Very truly yours,

The Honorable Salvador E. Casellas 
The Secretary of the Treasury 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
Box 4515 
san Juan, Puerto Rico 
Â°ear Mr. Secretary: 
This will acknowledge your letter to Governor Brimmer, 
dated June 29, 1973, about the proposed acquisition by First National 
City Overseas Investment Corporation of additional small loan com-
panies in Puerto Rico. 
The Board is grateful for having had the benefit of your 
Views, as expressed in your letter and also as conveyed to Governor 
^"timmer by telephone. They were very carefully considered by the 
0ard in its review of this case. 
As you know, in acting on applications made under Sections 25 
and 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board is usually asked to 
Pass on applications by American banks to engage in activities in for-
eign countries. In those cases, the Board is concerned with the impact 
the size and type of the proposed activities cn the member bank or 
Se Corporation involved and with the consistency of those activities 
^ith the public purposes of those Sections. 
Competitive considerations in markets abroad are normally 
Â°t a relevant factor: the Board has no immediate knowledge of the 
cÂ°nipetitive situation in those markets as ic may be affected by the 
of U.S. banks or by other institutions over which the Board has 
jurisdiction; in any event, the Board believes that the responsi-
J-ity for the financial structure in those markets rests with the local 
Authorities to be exercised in the light of their own laws and public 
P o l i cy goals. 
Because of Puerto Rico's special relationship to the United 
applications by member banks to acquire investments there are 
udled in the same way that other "foreign" acquisitions are treated. 

2661 
The Honorable Salvador E. Casellas -2-
So, it is necessary to appraise applications to do business in 
Puerto Rico by the same standards normally employed in deciding such 
cases. Consequently, the Board felt that it had no basis on which 
to make an independent judgment of the competitive situation in Puerto 
Rico. In this connection, the Board took note^of your indication that 
legislation is in preparation proposing enlarged authority for your 
Department to deal with the concerns mentioned in your letter. Such 
legislation will enable a public determination and resolution of the 
matter within the Commonwealth itself. Since the application in ques-
tion was not objectionable on other grounds, the Board did not believe 
that it should withhold its approval. 
As you will recall, the Board was instrumental in the prepa-
ration of the 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. 
These amendments resulted from public concern about the competitive 
implications of holding company acquisitions of financial enterprises 
other than banks. Since the passage of that legislation, the Board 
accumulated more than 2-1/2 years of experience in deciding such 
cases. If you wish to call upon that experience as you proceed in 
developing programs concerned with the structure of financial institu-
tions in the. Commonwealth, the Board would, of course, be willing to 
cooperate in any way it could, in keeping with the cooperative rela-
tionships already existing between the Board and your Department. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Chester B. Feldberg

7/12/73 
PÂ°r Mediate release 
July 12, 1973 
In response to inquiries, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
Syst m today provided the following interpretation, in the form of a question 
and an<5 swer, of the new penalty provisions that were part of its announcement 
Of j . 
y 5 amending Regulation Q which governs the payment of interest on deposits 
Question: How do the new penalty provisions apply, and how do they 
co previous Interpretations regarding amendment of time deposit agreements 
Answer: 
(a) As stated in the Board's announcement of July 5, 1973, the 
new 
er*alty provisions amend that part of Regulation Q "that permits the pay-
^nt o f a time deposit prior to maturity." These provisions apply to withdrawals 
of . 
nctpal and interest before maturity of new but not of previously existing 
ti*ne a 
GPÂ°sits. (The effective date of the new penalty provisions is July 5, 
i973 
although the rate changes were effective July 1.) 
(b) The previously existing interpretations regarding amendment 
time deposit agreement -- in contrast with withdrawal of principal and in-
" still apply. One interpretation (12 CFIl 217.122) permits without 
^ t y a, 
, 
L n c amendment of a deposit agreement so that funds left on deposit 
interest up to the applicable new ceiling for periods after the 
V e date of the new ceiling. Another interpretation (12 CFR 217.102) con-
amendments providing for longer maturity specifies that such an amend-
v
d
o e s Hot constitute payment before maturity. Here also, however, any
