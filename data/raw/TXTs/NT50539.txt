Discount rates. The establishment without change 
by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
on November 20, 1969, of the rates on discounts and advances in 
their existing schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that appropriate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that the most recent report of 
examination of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis had raised a 
question in his mind whether the Reserve Bank was administering its 
discount window in so liberal a manner as to suggest that it might 
not be operating within the confines of Regulation A , Advances and 
Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks. 
It was understood that the staff would study the question 
a
nd report back to the Board.

Item No. 
Letter to State Street Bank and Trust Company, 
1 
Boston, Massachusetts, (1) granting permission 
to organize a corporation under section 25(a) 
of the Federal Reserve Act to be known as State 
Street Bank Services International, New York, New 
York, and transmitting a preliminary permit, and 
(2) indicating an intention to grant consent, upon 
issuance of the final permit, to the acquisition 
of stock of a corporation to be organized under the laws 
of the Federal Republic of Germany, tentatively to be 
known as State Street Bank Munchen GmbH, Munich, 
Germany. 
Letter to The Chase Manhattan Bank (National 
2 
Association), New York, New York, approving its 
request that monthly reports on foreign branch assets 
and liabilit ies (F.R. 502) be required for branches

Letter to the Federal Reserve Banks regarding a System 
3 
conference of trust examiners to be held at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York on February 12 and 13, 1970. 
Republic National Bank. In a memorandum dated November 13, 
1969, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval 
of the request of Republic National Bank of New York, New York, New 
York, for permission to establish a branch in London, England. Con-
sideration of the application had been deferred at the request of 
Governor Brimmer pending inquiry into the circumstances leading 

3 4 9 9

to the frequency with which the bank had exceeded the ceiling set 
by the foreign credit restraint guidelines. In a memorandum dated 
November 14, 1969,,Governor Brimmer summarized the bank's explanation 
and indicated that he now saw no particular obstacle to action on 
the application. 
At today's meeting, reference was made to press reports con-
cerning an assertion by Chairman Ribicoff of the Senate Permanent 
Investigation Subcommittee that Republic National Bank was one of 
several American banks that had knowingly handled large sums of black 
market currency illegally smuggled out of South Vietnam. It was 
understood that the charge was being investigated. 
Under the circumstances, action on the application to establish 
a branch in London was deferred. 
First National City Bank. In a memorandum dated November 19, 
1969, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended suspension 
of the 30-day notice provision of section 213.3(a) of Regulation M , 
Foreign Activities of National Banks, as related to the proposed 
establishment by First National City Bank, New York, New York, of 
two additional branches in the Republic of Panama. 
During discussion, it was pointed out that the Department of 
State wished to obtain the views of the U. S. Embassy in Panama since 
the establishment of a branch in the Canal Zone by another United 
States bank had been protested by the Government of Panama. There was 
agreement with a suggestion that First National City Bank be apprised 
°f the reason for delay, if the Department of State had no objection.

Subject to clearance with the Department of State, unanimous 
approval was then given to a letter to First National City Bank in 
the form attached.as Item No. 4. 
(Note: The clearance was obtained.) 
Policy record entry. With a memorandum of November 18, 1969, 
Mr. Broida submitted a draft of policy record entry covering the meeting 
of the Federal Open Market Committee held on September 9, 1969, as 
revised to take account of comments received from Committee members 
and staff following distribution of a preliminary draft. 
The entry was approved by the Board, subject to the understanding 
that it would be distributed to the Reserve Bank Presidents for 
possible further comments and that it would be released to the press 
about December 8, 1969, after final review by the Board. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of North State Bank, Burlington, 
N

W a s
 approved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance

n
o adverse competitive effects. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The Simpson State Bank, Simpson, Kansas, and The Farmers 
State Bank of Asherville, Kansas, Asherville, Kansas, was approved

A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Marion Bank and Trust Company, Marion, North Carolina, into 
North Carolina National Bank, Charlotte, North Carolina, was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The 
conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the merger of Marion Bank and Trust 
Company, Marion, North Carolina, and North Carolina National 
Bank, Charlotte, would eliminate little competition and vir-
tually no potential for greater competition between them in 
the reasonably foreseeable future. Consummation of the merger 
would increase slightly the concentration of banking resources 
in the State in a few large banks. Overall the effect of the 
proposal on competition would be slightly adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Community State Bank, Lake Preston, South Dakota, into 
Northwestern National Bank of Sioux Falls, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 
W a s
 approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the 
Currency. The conclusion read as follows: 
There is little, if any, competition existing between 
Community State Bank, Lake Preston, and Northwestern 
National Bank of Sioux Falls, a subsidiary of Northwest 
Bancorporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, a registered bank 
holding company. The latter holding company owns 3 other 
banks in South Dakota, and its 4 subsidiaries hold about 
23 per cent of the total deposits in the State. 
Consummation 
of the proposal would increase this concentration slightly. 
The overall competitive effect would be slightly adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
m e r
g e r of Capital City Bank of Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville, 
Tennessee, into The Nashville Bank and Trust Co., Nashville, Tennessee 
a s
 3££roved unanimously for transmittal to the Federal Deposit 
Ins 
trance Corporation. The conclusion read as follows:

11/21/69 
-7-
Consummation of the proposed merger of Capital City 
Bank of Nashville, Tennessee, into The Nashville Bank 
and Trust Co. would eliminate existing as well as 
potential for greater competition between the two banks. 
Overall, the-effect of the proposal on competition would 
be adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of United States National Bank, San Diego, California, and 
Bank of Santa Ana, Santa Ana, California, was approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion 
read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of United States 
National Bank, San Diego, and Bank of Santa Ana would 
eliminate existing competition and potential for increased 
competition between the two banks. The overall competitive 
effect of the proposed merger would be adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Rockland National Bank, Suffern, New York, into County 
National Bank, Middletown, New York, was approved unanimously for 
transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion read 
a
s follows: 
There is some competition existing between Rockland 
National Bank, Suffern, and County National Bank, Middletown, 
and there is potential for increased competition between 
them. If the proposed merger is consummated, County National 
Bank, the third largest commercial bank in the State's Third 
Banking District, would expand its operations into another 
county, increasing significantly its number of offices and 
deposit volume through the elimination of the largest com-
mercial bank domiciled in Rockland County. The overall 
competitive effect would be adverse. 
Governor Daane withdrew from the meeting at this point.

Egg Harbor Bank and Trust Company. The president of Egg 
Harbor Bank and Trust Company, Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, a 
State member bank, had been convicted in Federal District Court on 
two counts of a previously returned Federal grand jury indictment. 
Motions pending before the court included a motion for a new trial, 
and the president of Egg Harbor Bank had voluntarily agreed to 
withdraw from further participation in the conduct of the affairs of 
the bank until final disposition had been made of the charges against 
him. in a letter dated October 17, 1969, to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Philadelphia the Board agreed that no useful purpose would be served 
by 
instituting at this time an administrative proceeding under the 
Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966. This conclusion was 
based on the assumption, among others, that the president's agreement 
t o
 withdraw from participation in the bank's affairs, as stated in 
his letter, included participation in any capacity, including exercising 
his voting rights as a shareholder. 
At today's meeting Mr. O'Connell reported on further com-
plications with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia from which 
i f c
 appeared that (1) it had not been the intention of the president 
to forego his voting rights as a shareholder; (2) the Deputy Com-
m i
ssioner of Banking for the State of New Jersey questioned the right 
••'q-SC j, . 4 ... 
a n
y supervisory agency to deprive a stockholder of his voting rights; 
and, 
( 3 ) the president held less than 10 per cent of the outstanding 

3 5 0 4 
11/21/69 
- 9 -
shares of Egg Harbor Bank. Taking these factors into account, it 
was the recommendation of the Reserve Bank, in which Mr. O'Connell 
concurred, that restrictions on the president's voting rights as a 
shareholder should be withdrawn. 
During discussion, question was raised as to the extent that 
the president through direct or indirect control of stock might be 
able to influence elections of directors, thereby 
perpetuating 
control of management. Accordingly, it was understood that additional 
•J. «' ; • 
> • 
• 
_ 
information with respect to stock distribution would be obtained by 
the staff prior to further consideration of the matter. 
Issuance of commercial paper. In a memorandum dated 
November 20, 1969, the Office of the Secretary discussed a proposal 
°f the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that consideration be given 
to the use of moral suasion to limit the issuance of commercial paper 
by banks or bank holding companies to the level of their October 29 
outstandings until such time as the Board had had an opportunity to 
review comments received with respect to its proposal to apply 
Regulation Q rate ceilings 
to commercial paper issued by bank holding 
companies. Attached to the memorandum was an outline suggested by 
New York Reserve Bank for use by Reserve Bank Presidents in 
Presenting the problem to the chief executive officers of banks or 
holding companies in their respective districts. 

11/21/69 
-10-
Mr. Holland reported that Chairman Martin, although personally 
not inclined to favor the proposal, had requested that it be presented 
to the other members of the Board for discussion. Mr. Holland also 
understood that Governor Sherrill's reaction was negative. 
Tentative comments indicated that Governors Mitchell and 
Brimmer were not receptive to the idea, Governor Brimmer expressing 
the view that it would be unwise to undertake moral suasion in an 
area in which the Board had the authority to regulate. Governor Robertson 
noted the absence of a quorum and stated that he would express his 
views at a time when there was sufficient Board representation to reach 
a decision. 
It was understood that the matter would be brought back for 
consideration when additional members of the Board were present. 
Balance of payments program. Governor Brimmer reviewed the 
circumstances that had led to further delay in announcing the terms 
°f the new U. S. balance of payments program, noting that the details 
the Board's Foreign Credit Restraint Program were not at issue. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letter of October 31, 
1969, advising, pursuant to the provisions of Section 213.3(a) 
of Regulation M, of your intention to establish two additional 
branches in the Republic of Panama, to be located in Las 
Tablas and Aguadulce. 
The Department of State has advised that it desires 
to request" the views of the Embassy irv P:;iu. a regarding cs« 
tablishment of the proposed branches. Accordingly, in this 
instance, the Board of Governors has suspended the provisions 
of Section 213.3(a) of Regulation M relating to the estab-
lishmer t of additional branches after thirty days' notice 
to the Board.
