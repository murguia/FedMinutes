ration, to be formed in Australia. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Farmers and Merchants Bank 
of Lawrenceville, Lawrenceville, Virginia, and Virginia National Bank, 
Norfolk, Virginia, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion read as follows: 
The proposed merger of Farmers and Merchants 
Bank of Lawrenceville and Virginia National Bank, 
Norfolk, would eliminate little, if any, existing 
or potential competition. Overall, the proposal 
would have no adverse competitive effects. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of The National Bank of Woodstock, Woodstock, Virginia, into 
Virginia National Bank, Norfolk, Virginia, was approved unanimously 
for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion 
read as follows: 
There appears to be no existing or potential 
competition between The National Bank of Woodstock 
and Virginia National Bank, Norfolk, and overall 
the proposal would have no adverse effects on 
competition. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Bank of Bruce, Bruce, Mississippi, with Bank of Mississippi, 
Tupelo, Mississippi, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The conclusion read as follows

There appears to be no competition existing 
between Bank of Bruce and Bank of Mississippi, 
Tupelo. Overall, the proposal would have no adverse 
competitive effects. 
A draft of report on the competitive factors involved in the 
proposed merger of two El Paso, Illinois, banks (El Paso National 
Bank and The Woodford County National Bank of El Paso) had been 
considered by the Board on May 10, 1968, at which time Governor Maisel 
had suggested that the report point out more clearly that at the time 
the two banks came under common ownership a violation of section 1 of the 
Sherman Act may have occurred. The report had been revised accordingly 
and was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the 
Currency. The conclusion, which was unchanged from the original draft, 
read as follows: 
In view of the close relationship which exists between 
El Paso National Bank and The Woodford County National Bank 
of El Paso, no effective competition exists between them. 
The banks were vigorous competitors prior to their affilia-
tion and consummation of the proposed transaction would 
permanently preclude the restoration of competition between 
them. Overall, the effect of the proposal on competition 
would be substantially adverse. 
First at Orlando. 
Issuance of an order and statement reflect-
ing the Board's approval on April 29, 1968, of the application of 
First at Orlando Corporation, Orlando, Florida, to acquire shares of

Accounting for stock dividends. A memorandum from the Division 
of Examinations and the Legal Division dated May 13, 1968, discussed a 
proposed rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to 
accounting for stock dividends. The memorandum, which contained a 
summary of points reviewed at a meeting of Board staff with represen-
tatives of the Commission, recommended that the Board request clarifi-
cation of the terminology of the rule, as it was proposed to be made 
applicable to banks, and also that the Commission be asked to grant 
an exemption for banks under the rule if a share distribution was 
approved by a bank supervisory agency. 
After discussion, unanimous approval was given to a letter to 
the Chairman of the Commission incorporating the staff recommendations. 
A copy is attached as Item No. 6. 
Foreign travel. The Board authorized travel by John F. L. 
Ghiardi of the Division of International Finance approximately from 
May 28 to June 12, 1968, to accompany Governor Maisel to Basle, Switzer-
land, for the annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements 
and to visit the central banks of England, Belgium, and Italy.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, New York 
New York, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 9 and 25 of the Fed-
eral Reserve Act, to establish a branch at Stockerstrasse 38, Zurich, 
Switzerland, and to operate and maintain such branch subject to the 
provisions of such Sections and of Regulation M. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before June 1, 1969, all rights granted hereby shall 
be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted 
will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, when the branch is opened for business. 
The Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Zurich. 
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the form 
of allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as 
foreign assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. 
In view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 
investments on the balance of payments, the above consent is given 
with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's operations 
maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the 
United States. Accordingly, it is understood that any investment 
required will be made within the guidelines established under the 

Morgan Guaranty Trust Company

will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of DSMC as it may require from time

(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by DSMC

(4) That DSMC will confine its activities essentially to

acquisition the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 
be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a mono-
Poly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, 
unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed 
transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable 
effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the 
community to be served. In each case, the Board is required to take 
i n t 0 consideration the financial and managerial resources and future 
Prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, and the 
convenience and needs of the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - The 10 largest 
at*king organizations in Florida, including 7 bank holding companies, 
^ntrol 37 per cent of the deposits held by all commerical banks in the 
e* Applicant, whose five subsidiaries account for 2.3 per cent of 
Such deposits, is presently the sixth largest banking organization and 
sixth largest of 12 bank holding companies in the State. Upon con-
UtIttTlation of the proposed acquisition, Applicant would rank fifth in 
oth categories, and would increase its share of deposits in the State 
to 2 A 
'â€¢o per cent. 

-3-
Applicant's largest subsidiary, the First National Bank at 
Orlando, has total deposits of $142 million and is the largest bank 
in Orlando. Of the other four subsidiaries, uhich range in size from 
60 
Â£ , 
to 
$18 million, three are located within Orlando; the fourth is 
close to the city limits and about five miles from downtown Orlando. 
These subsidiaries account for about 42 per cent of the deposits held 
bV 18 banks located in Orange County. Two other holding companies, 
1 i' v 
Jig ^ , 
. 
both of which are larger than Applicant, have one subsidiary bank each 
In Orange County. Together, the three bank holding companies account 
63 per cent of the deposits held by Orange County banks. IJhile the 
extent of this existing concentration is a matter of concern, consummation 
the present proposal would not affect Applicant's holdings, increase 
concentration. or reduce banking alternatives uithin Orange County or 
portion thereof. 
Bank is located in the northwest corner of Lake County, about 
2 / 
* 
4 0 miles northwest of Orlando, and its primary service area 
encompasses 
a n area within a 15 mile radius of Leesburg. The southeast extremity of 
Chis area lies approximately 15 miles from the northwest extremity of the 
a r e a delineated by Applicant at the time of its formation in 1967, as the

the Leesburg area is the First National Bank at Orlando. Of its total 
loans and time and savings deposits, 1.5 and 2.4 per cent, respectively, 
originate in the primary service area of Bank. The only meaningful 
business derived by Bank from the Orlando area is 2 per cent of its 
time and savings deposits. In view of the small degree of market over-
lap, the distance separating the two primary service areas, and the fact 
that a number of banks are located within this intervening area, there 
appears to be no significant competition between Bank and Applicant's 
Present subsidiaries. These same factors, as well as a State prohibition 
against branching, also make it unlikely that such competition would 
develop between them in the future. 
Bank is the larger of two banks in Leesburg and the largest 
nine banks competing in its primary service area, and accounts for 
22 
per cent of area deposits. Four of the eight other banks in the 
area, including its Leesburg competitor, have deposits in excess of 
$ lÂ° million. It does not appear that the continued viability or com-
petitive effectiveness of any of the competing banks would be adversely 
affected by Bank's acquisition by Applicant. Since the proposed acqui-
8*tion represents Applicant's initial entry into Lake County and Bank's 
Primary service area, concentration in those areas would not be increased 
no alternative source of banking services would be eliminated. 
On the basis of the record before it, the Board concludes that 
of Applicant's proposal would not result in a monopoly, nor 
kÂ® in furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize 

the business of banking in any relevant area, nor would such consum-
mation substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or 
restrain trade in any section of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant is in sound financial condition and has qualified management. 
Each of its present subsidiaries has competent management and has exper-
ienced good growth, and the financial condition of each is generally 
satisfactory. Applicant's prospects are dependent on those of its sub-
sidiary banks, and are regarded as favorable. 
Bank's financial condition is reasonably satisfactory, and its 
Present management appears to be experienced and competent. Two of its 
senior officers, however, expect to retire within the next year, and a 
third is approaching retirement. While response to Bank's future manage-
aent needs does not appear to be dependent on its affiliation with Appli-
cant, consummation of the proposal would probably facilitate the filling 
vacancies anticipated in the near future. Bank's prospects appear 
^vorable regardless of whether it is affiliated with Applicant; however 
t h e internal efficiencies and improved earnings which the proposed affil 
iation 
seems to assure offer sufficiently more favorable prospects as to 
institute a factor supporting approval of the application. 
The banking factors, as they relate to Applicant, are found to 
bÂ° consistent with approval of the application. As they relate to Bank, 
S U ch factors lend slight weight in favor of approval. 

1 8 1 7

Convenience and needs of the communities served, - There is no 
evidence to indicate that Bank's affiliation with Applicant's group would 
have any significant effect on the convenience and needs of Orlando or 
surrounding communities. The existence of an affiliate of Applicant 
in Leesburg should have little or no effect on Orlando customers. 
. In the Leesburg area most of the immediate advantages of the 
Proposed affiliation will accrue directly to Bank in the form of inter-
nal improvements, and only indirectly to the banking public. However, 
there is some evidence of a demand for credit in the area in amounts 
beyond the capacity of any local institution, and it is alleged that, 
in times of tight money, difficulties have been encountered in obtaining 
correspondent assistance in handling overlines. The proposed affiliation 
should provide a greater facility in arranging participation by other of 
Applicant's subsidiaries in such lending. Also, Lake County ranks second 
the State in the growing, processing, packaging, and shipping of citrus 
fruit s. Applicant's largest subisidary bank has, for many years, been 
actively involved in financing the citrus industry in its area, and has 
developed experience in this field which should be of value to the 
leesburg area. 
Considerations related to the convenience and needs of the 
communities involved are consistent with, and lend some weight toward, 
aPProval of the application. 
Summary and Conclusion. - Based on all the relevant facts 
cÂ°ntained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in

OFFICE OF T H E V I C E

May 17, 1968 
The Honorable Manuel F. Cohen, Chairman, â€¢ 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
500 North Capitol Street, N. W., 
Washington, D. C. 20549 
Dear Mr. Cohen: 
This will supplement the Board's letter of April 9, 1968, 
in response to the Commission's notice of proposal to adopt Rule 10b-12 
contained in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8268. The proposed 
rule's effect on banks was discussed by our staffs on April 19, 1968. 
As previously indicated, certain terms used in the proposed 
rule are not generally used in bank accounting and the aforesaid dis-
cussion helped to resolve some confusion as to the intended effect of 
the rule. The Board recommends, as a minimum, clarification of the 
terminology of the rule, as it will be applicable to banks. 
It has also come to the Board's attention that several indus-
try 
groups and bank supervisory agencies have requested an exemption 
from the proposed rule for banks on the ground that banks are already 
subject to strict supervision by such agencies. However, since no 
uniform policy with respect to stock dividends has been adopted by the 
bank supervisory agencies involved - i.e., the Comptroller of the Currency 
with respect to national banks and the State authorities with respect 
to State banks - it has been suggested that a minimum standard would 
be necessary to accomplish the objectives of the Commission. The Board 
believes this approach has merit and submits the attached language for 
consideration by the Commission. 
Enclosure 
Sincerely, 

Suggested Exemption for Banks in Connection 
With Proposed Rule 10b-12 of the SEC 
"(d) This rule shall not apply to a share distribution, 
as referred to in paragraph (a), by a bank, as defined in 
section (3)(a)(6) of the Act, as to which a State or Federal 
bank supervisory agency has determined (i) that the bank has 
earned surplus in either its surplus or undivided profits 
account, equal at least to the fair value, as defined in 
paragraph (b), of the shares so distributed, or (ii) that 
such distribution is not a manipulative or deceptive device 
or contrivance comprehended within the purpose of the rule. 
As used herein, "earned surplus' means undistributed earnings 
as reflected by the bank's records at 
_____> 1968, 
Plus amounts subsequently transferred to undivided profits or 
surplus from income, less cash dividends declared and the fair 
value of shares issued as stock dividends after that date."
