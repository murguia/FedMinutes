Press release relating to earnings of the

Federal Reserve Banks during 1966. 
Discount administration conference calls. Early in September 
1966 telephone conferences were initiated as one of the channels of com-
munication between Federal Reserve Bank discount officers and the Board's 
staff in connection with the discount administration program related to 
the letter of September 1 to all member banks. On December 27, 1966, 
the purposes of that letter having been served, the Board authorized the 
Reserve Bank Presidents to inform member banks in their districts that 
the special discount arrangements were terminated. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated January 3, 
1967, from the Division of Examinations recommending that the staff be 
authorized to continue the conference calls on a periodic basis. In 
commenting on the recommendation, Mr. Leavitt said it was the general 
feeling of the participants that the conference calls had been worth 
while. The calls had afforded an opportunity for discount officers to

discuss mutual problems, and the Board's staff had benefited from an 
increased awareness of developments at the Reserve Bank level. 
Following supplementary remarks by Mr. Holland endorsing the 
recommendation, discussion turned to the range of matters that would 
normally be discussed in such conference calls. The staff expressed 
the view that individual cases of borrowing might best be handled by 
discussion with the individual Reserve Bank concerned, and there was 
general agreement on that score. However, it was suggested that group 
discussion of broader issues of discount administration reflecting 
experience with particular cases or diverse trends in borrowing by 
districts would seem beneficial. It was agreed that the conference 
calls likewise provided an appropriate mechanism for briefing the dis-
count officers on the money market environment that appeared to be 
developing at any given time, in order to alert them to conditions 
under which the discount windows might be operating. 
Reference was made to the reports on borrowings by reserve city 
and country member banks, distributed to the Board members periodically, 
and it was suggested that justification of the circumstances surrounding 
borrowings reflected in such reports that appeared unusual in nature be 
sought promptly from the Reserve Banks concerned rather than to await 
the quarterly discount reports filed by the respective Banks. 
After further discussion along these lines, the staff was 
authorized to continue the conference calls with discount officers on

a monthly basis, with permission to schedule calls more frequently should 
that appear desirable and with the understanding that a memorandum sum-
marizing each call would be distributed to the members of the Board and 
to the Reserve Banks. 
Governor Brimmer made the suggestion that consideration also be 
given to using the device of conference calls to improve communication 
within the System in areas other than discount administration where it 
appeared that such a mechanism for the exchange of views might be of 
advantage in considering issues of common interest. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: The requirements contem-
plated by the Board's action on December 9, 
1966, in approving the issuance of a prelimi-
nary permit to Security First International 
Corporation, Los Angeles, California, having 
been completed, a letter was sent today to 
that corporation transmitting a final permit 
to commence business. 
Governor Shepardson today approved on behalf 
of the Board the following items: 
Telegram to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (copy attached 
a s Item No. 6) approving the appointment of Joseph F. Godava as assis-
tant examiner.
