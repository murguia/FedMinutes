a report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Third National Bank in Nashville, Nashville, 
Tennessee, with Third State Bank, N.A., Nashville, Tennessee, 
the conclusion stating that consummation of the proposed merger 
(which was merely a transaction to facilitate the acquisition of 
Third National Bank by NLT Corporation, a newly-formed holding 
company) would have no adverse competitive effects.

Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal to the 
Comptroller of the Currency of a report on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed merger of Capital National Bank, Houston, 
Texas, with Capital Bank, National Association, Houston, Texas, the 
conclusion stating that consummation of the proposed merger (which 
was merely a transaction to facilitate the acquisition of Capital 
National Bank by Capital National Corporation, a newly-formed 
holding company) would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of a report on the competi-
tive factors involved in the proposed consolidation of The Bank 
of Manchester Company, Manchester, Ohio, and The Winchester Bank 
Company, Winchester, Ohio, the conclusion stating that consummation 
of the proposed consolidation would have no adverse competitive 
effects. 
Unanimous approval was given to the transmittal to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of a report on the competi-
tive factors involved in the proposed merger of Commercial Security 
Bank, Ogden, Utah, with Beehive State Bank, Salt Lake City, Utah, 
the conclusion reading as follows: 
The proposed merger would eliminate a small amount 
of competition existing between Beehive State Bank, 
Salt Lake City, and Commercial Security Bank, Ogden. 
The development of future competition in Salt Lake City 
between the two banks is believed to be somewhat limited. 
Overall, the effect of the proposal on competition 
would be slightly adverse.

covering the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on

received from Committee members and staff following distribution 
of a preliminary draft. 
The entry was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that it would be distributed to the Reserve Bank Presidents pri-
marily for information but with an indication of the date by which 
any further comments should be received. It was contemplated that 
the entry would be released about December 9, 1968, after final

renewed request of the President of Seattle Trust & Savings Bank, 
Seattle, Washington, for an exemption from the requirement of 
Regulation F, Securities of Member State Banks, that information 
concerning remuneration of officers and directors be disclosed 
in proxy-soliciting material. A copy of the letter is attached as 
Item No. 6. (Note: Pursuant to a suggestion at this meeting the 
Board's letter was read to President Swan of the Reserve Bank 
before being transmitted, and he expressed no objection.) 
Citizens Bank & Trust Company. The Board approved unani-
mously a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago expressing 
the opinion, in response to a request from Citizens Bank & Trust 
Company, Park Ridge, Illinois, that a time account plan proposed 
to be offered by the bank complied with applicable provisions of 
Regulation Q, Payment of Interest on Deposits. A copy of the letter 
is attached as Item No. 7. 
Amendment of Regulation A and related interpretation. 
Public Law 90-505, approved September 21, 1968, had amended the 
eighth paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act to 

3944 
11/13/68

authorize advances thereunder to member banks secured by such 
obligations as are eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve 
Banks under section 14(b) of the Act. Under section 14(b), 
direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by, the United States or any agency 
thereof are eligible for purchase. 
With a memorandum of October 31, 1968, the Legal Division 
submitted a draft of interpretation of Regulation A, Advances and 
Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks, specifying the more important 
agency issues now eligible as collateral, along with a draft of 
amendment of certain sections of Regulation A reflecting changes 
made by Public Law 90-505 and the proposed interpretation. 
The amendment was approved unanimously, effective 
November 13, 1968, along with the issuance of the interpretation. 
Copies of the amendment and the interpretation, as published in 
the Federal Register, are attached as Items 8 and 9, respectively. 
Branch question. In connection with the decision by the 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the matter of Fred 0. Dickinson, Jr., 
Comptroller of the State of Florida; Ex Officio Commissioner of 
Banking et al. v. The First National Bank in Plant City, Plant City, 
Florida, and William B. Camp, Comptroller of the Currency of the 
United States, the Department of Justice had invited the Board's 
t,; v>\i :> 
f j; „\.x |»i:

views relative to preparation of a recommendation to the Solicitor 
General as to whether a petition for writ of certiorari should be 
filed. 
With a memorandum dated November 7, 1968, the Legal 
Division submitted a draft of reply expressing the opinion that a 
review of the decision by the Supreme Court would be most desirable 
and stating reasons for that opinion. 
To the memorandum also was attached an alternative draft 
of reply, requested by Governor Maisel, in which the Board would 
recommend against the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari, 
principally on the ground that the effect of the decision by the 
Court of Appeals would be to promote competitive equality between 
national and State banks and also to reduce the area of possible 
conflicts in statutory interpretations by the Board and the Comp-
troller of the Currency. 
The first question involved in deciding on the reply that 
should be made to the Justice Department was whether or not the 
Board should recommend that a petition for writ of certiorari be 
filed. If that question was answered in the affirmative, the 
second question related to the extent, if at all, to which the 
Board should include an exposition of views and opinions. 
After the arguments on both sides of the first issue had 
been debated, it was the majority view that the Board should 

11/13/68 
-8-
recommend that a petition be filed. On the second issue, it 
developed to be the majority view that the reply should be sub-
stantially in the form suggested by the Legal Division, without 
the inclusion of a paragraph setting forth the argument against 
seeking a review of the decision. 
Accordingly, approval was given to a letter to the 
Department of Justice in the form attached as Item No. 10, 
Governor Maisel dissenting.

Gentlemen: 
This will acknowledge your letter of September 3, 1968, 
addressed to Vice President Campbell of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Philadelphia, advising that due to a new local restriction, you 
have found it necessary to arrange for additional space for your 
proposed branch in London, England. 
It is understood that this additional space is located 
in Plantation House, 35 Fenchurch Street, London, E.C.3, and is 
to be used solely to accommodate bookkeeping, letter of credit 
processing, and like operational functions, and that there will 
be no contact with the public at these premises, all public 
services to be available only at 38 Walbrook. 
Under the above circumstances, the Board interposes 
no objection to the utilization of the additional space in con-
junction with the branch which was authorized in the Board's 
letter of May 24, 1968. It is requested, however, that advance 
notice be supplied the Board of any material change in the operations 
that may be contemplated at the Fenchurch Street location or any 
change in the location of that facility. 
Very truly yours,

Item No. 4 
11/13/68 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
In the Matter of the Application of 
THE CENTRAL BANCORPORATION, INC., 
Cincinnati, Ohio, 
for approval of action to become a bank 
hiding company through the acquisition 
CO per cent or more of the voting 
shares of The Central Trust Company, 
Cincinnati, Ohio, and The Citizens National 
Bank of Marietta, Marietta, Ohio, 
ORDER APPROVING APPLICATION UNDER 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1242(a)(1)) and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(12 CFR 222.3(a)), an application by The Central Bancorporation, Inc., 
Cincinnati, Ohio, for the Board's prior approval of action whereby 
Applicant would become a bank holding company through the acquisition 
80 per cent or more of the voting shares of The Central Trust 
Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, and The Citizens National Bank of Marietta, 
Marietta, Ohio. 

As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board notified 
the Ohio Superintendent of Banks and the Comptroller of the Currency 
receipt of the application and requested their views and recom-
mendations. The Superintendent and the Comptroller both recommended 
approval of the application.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY 
THE CENTRAL BANCORPORATION, INC., 
CINCINNATI, OHIO, TO BECOME 
A BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
STATEMENT 
The Central Bancorporation, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio ("Applicant"), 
has filed v;ith the Board, pursuant to section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Hold-
ing Company Act of 1956, an application for approval of action to 
become a bank holding company through the acquisition of 80 per cent 
°r more of the voting shares of The Central Trust Company, Cincinnati, 
Ohio ("Central"), and The Citizens National Bank of Marietta, Marietta, 
Ohio ("Citizens"). 
Central operates 22 banking offices with total deposits of 
1/ 
§482 million. 
Citizens has two offices and holds deposits of 
$19 million. 
Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, notice of receipt of the appli-
cation was given to, and views and recommendations requested of the 
Ohio Superintendent of Banks and the Comptroller of the Currency. 
Both recommended approval of the application. 
i/ All banking data are as of December 30, 1967, unless otherwise noted. 

-2-
Statutory considerations, - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy -
to monopolize or «to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in 
any part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
acquisition the effect of which, in any section of the country, may be 
substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, 
which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless 
the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed trans-
action are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable • 
effect of the 
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the 
community to be served. In each case the Board is required to take into 
consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, and the convenience 
and needs of the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of rfroposed transaction. - The 10 largest 
banking organizations in Ohio, ,of which three are bank holding companies, 
control 36 banks with total deposits of $0.6 billion, representing 
46.4 
per cent of the deposits held by the 530 insured commercial banks 
in the 
State. Central is the ninth largest banking organization in 
Ohio, and accounts for 2.6 per cent of the total deposits held by banks 
in the State. If its proposal is consummated, Applicant would rank 
eighth in size among the State's largest banking organizations and 

3854 
-3-
third among five bank holding companies, and would control 2.7 per cent 
of total bank deposits in Ohio, Statewide concentration therefore 
would not be significantly affected, and this consideration does not 
present a bar to approval of the application. 
Central is the third largest of six banks in Cincinnati, and 
of eight banks in Hamilton County, Ohio. Marietta, where both of Citi-
zens' offices are located, is in Washington County, about 200 miles 
from Cincinnati. Citizens is the second largest of three banks in 
Marietta, and of eight banks in Washington County. There is no com-
petition between Central and Citizens at present and little prospect 
that such competition would develop in the future, in view of the 
distance between the two banks and the fact that State law limits 
branching to the County in which the head office of the bank is located. 
Consummation of the proposal therefore would not eliminate existing or 
potential competition between the two banks and would not increase 
banking concentration in the area served by either bank. Neither does 
it appear that the viability or competitive effectiveness of competing 
banks in either area would be adversely affected. 
On the record before the Board, it is concluded that the 
proposed transaction will not result in a monopoly or be in furtherance 
of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business 
of banking in any relevant area. Further, consummation of the proposal 
would not substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, 
or restrain trade in any section of the country. •

Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant has no operating history. Its projected financial condition 
is regarded as satisfactory, as is its management, which will be 
comprised of officers and directors of Central. The financial 
condition and management of the proposed subsidiary banks also are 
regarded as satisfactory, and the prospects of Applicant and the banks 
appear favorable. 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
considerations relating to this factor are consistent with approval of 
the application. 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - Consummation 
of Applicant's proposal will not lead to any significant additions to, 
or improvements upon, the services which Central is now able to provide 
its customers. However, the availability to Citizens of the resources 
and banking expertise which Applicant would possess could result 
in significant improvements in the level of banking service available 
to residents of Marietta and IJashington County. Applicant proposes 
to provide Citizens with the means of expanding the scope of its trust 
services, to pursue branching opportunities which will provide more 
convenient availability of banking services, and to increase Citizens' 
effectiveness in serving the need for business and construction loans. 
Through Citizens, Applicant would also provide the area with a check 
credit plan, travel agency services, student loans, computer payroll

- ' ' 
-5-
accountings and market research; By facilitating loan participations 
between Citizens and Central, the transaction will increase the credit 
resources available to the area. 
Considerations bearing upon the convenience and needs of 
customers in Marietta and Washington County weigh in favor of approval 
of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained in the record and in the light of the factors set forth in 
section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
transaction would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved.

APPLICATION BY 
SOUTHEAST BANCORPORATION, INC., MIAMI, FLORIDA, 
FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION OF VOTING SHARES OF 
FIRST CITY BANK OF TAMPA, TAMPA, FLORIDA 
STATEMENT 
Southeast Bancorporation, Inc., Miami, Florida ("Applicant"), 
a registered bank holding company, has applied to the Board of Governors, 
pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), for prior approval of the acquisition of 
80 per cent or more of the voting shares of First City Bank of Tampa, 
Tampa, Florida ("Tampa Bank"). 
Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board notified the Florida 
Commissioner of Banking of the application and requested his views 
and recommendation. The Commissioner advised the Board that he had 
approved an Application relating to the same transaction pursuant 
to section 659.14 of the Florida Statutes, subject to approval by 
the Board of Governors.

that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 

3360 
-2-
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve any other pro-
posed acquisition the effect of which, in any section of the country, 
may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a 
monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of tr^de, 
unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed 
transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the 
probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and 
needs of the community to be served. In each case the Board is 
required to take into consideration the financial and managerial 
resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the 
banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to be 
served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - Applicant, the 
second largest holding company and second largest banking organization 
in the State of Florida, presently controls three banks with aggregate 
1/ 
deposits of $649 million. 
The 10 largest banking organizations, the 
seven largest of which are bank holding companies, presently control 
about 37 per cent of the total commercial bank deposits in the State. 
Applicant now controls 6.7 per cent of the total deposits held by the 
State's 447 commercial banks. Upon completion of the proposed

acquisition, its market share of total deposits would be 6.8 per cent. 
Approval of the application would therefore have little effect on 
State-wide concentration. 
Tampa Bank is located in the City of Tampa, Hillsborough 
County, Florida. All of Applicant's present subsidiary banks are in 
Dade County, 250 miles from Tampa. Less than 1 per cent of Tampa

Applicant's largest subsidiary 
derives a small amount of time deposits 
(about $20,000) and instalment loans (under $100,000), and about 
$5 million of commercial loans, almost all of which are greatly in 
excess of Tampa Bank's legal lending limit, from Tampa Bank's 
service area. It appears that there is no significant competition 
between Applicant's present subsidiary banks and Tampa Bank, and 
in view of the distances involved and the prohibition against branch 
banking in Florida, it does not appear likely that such competition 
would develop in the future. 
Tampa Bank, with deposits of $15.5 million, is twelfth in 
size of the 24 banks, with total deposits of $736 million, in Hills-
borough County. Its most direct competitors are three banks in 
downtown Tampa, with deposits of $197 million, $174 million, and 
$79 million, respectively, each of which is the largest bank either 
In a holding company system or in a banking chain. The effect of 
the proposal should tend to enhance Tampa Bank's position as a

competitor of these large organizations. The present level of 
concentration in Tampa and Hillsborough County would not be increased 
by the present proposal, and it does not appear that there would be 
any significant adverse effect on the viability or competitive 
effectiveness of the smaller, unaffiliated banks in the area. 
In light of these facts, the Board concludes that con-
summation of the proposed acquisition would not result in a monopoly 
nor be in furtherance of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to 
monopolize the business of banking in any area. It does not appear 
that the proposal would have the effect of substantially lessening 
competition or tending to create a monopoly in any section of the 
country, nor would it in any other manner be in restraint of trade. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant's financial condition, its management, and its prospects 
are considered satisfactory. 
The present capital of Tampa Bank is somewhat below the 
desirable level for a bank of its size, and present management lacks 
experience in the commercial loan field. These facts have been 
recognized by Applicant, which proposes, if the present application 
is approved, to provide additional capital and to strengthen existing 
management. 
Considerations under this factor are consistent with approval 
of the application.

Convenience and needs of the communities involved, - The 
banks operating in Tampa and Hillsborough County provide those areas 
with reasonably complete banking services. Consummation of the 
proposal, however, would permit Tampa Bank to institute trust ser-
vices and modern data processing facilities, and would provide the 
bank with experienced commercial loan officers and other profes-
sional personnel. In addition, Applicant proposes to move Tanpii 
Bank's present banking quarters, presently located two blocks from 
Tampa's main thoroughfare, to the main thoroughfare. 
These considerations weigh in favor of approval of the 
application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in 
section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
acquisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved.

Mr. Eliot J. Swan, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 
San Francisco, California. 94120 
Dear Mr. Swan: 
Reference is made to your letter of October 4, 1968, 
transmitting a letter from Mr. J. C. Baillargeon, Jr., President 
of Seattle Trust & Savings Bank, Seattle, Washington, renewing a 
request for confidential treatment of information, relating to remuner-
ation of directors and officers of a bank, required to be included 
in proxy soliciting material to be furnished shareholders, pursuant 
to section 206.5 of Federal Reserve Regulation F. Mr. Baillargeon 
states that he has contacted the two other State banks in Washington 
subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation disclosure regulations 
and received confirmation that their salary structures are such that 
neither will have to report the salary of any individual officer for 
1968. He further states that since national banks are not required 
to disclose salaries of their highest paid officers, he is the only 
bank officer "in the entire State of Washington banking community 
whose salary becomes a matter of public notoriety". 
Although the Board understands Mr. Baillargeon1s position 
it does not believe it can, consistent with its statutory responsi-
bilities, grant the bank's request. As indicated in the Board's 
letter of December 19, 1967, it was the intent of the 1964 amendments 
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require corporations whose 
securities are traded in the over-the-counter market, including banks, 
to make public more information about their affairs than has been 
customary in the past. Consistent with such statutory responsibilities, 
the Board, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, adopted the regulatory provision 
in question in the belief that public disclosure in a proxy statement 

3 9 G 5 
Mr. Eliot J. Swan 
-2-
to shareholders of management's remuneration helps to evaluate 
management and permit the intelligent exercise of the shareholder's 
vote. 
No persuasive reasons are advanced that would justify 
exempting the bank from complying with requirements that are applicable 
to and have been complied with all other institutions similarly 
situated. In addition, if the Board were to grant the bank's request 
for the reasons submitted, it could hardly deny similar requests from 
many other banks which are the only banks subject to Regulation F in 
their banking communities; such action would diminish the effectiveness 
of a regulatory provision that the Board believes to be in the public 
interest. 
Rather than look to the limited class of persons whose 
salaries, although comparable, are not required to be disclosed, it 
is suggested that Mr. Baillargeon would do well to look to the large 
number of industrial and bank executives whose compensation arrange-
ments are disclosed. It might also be mentioned that press reports 
of stockholders' meetings of several national banks have indicated 
that where remuneration information is not contained in the bank's 
proxy statement, it is the subject of questions by stockholders at 
such meetings. 
It would be appreciated if you would make such reply to 
Mr. Baillargeon as you deem appropriate in view of the above. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Assistant Secretary.

Dear Mr. Larson: 
This is in response to your letter of October 7, 1968, 
forwarding a request of Citizens Bank & Trust Company, Park Ridge, 
Illinois, for the Board's views with respect to the status, under 
Regulation Q, of the "United Security Account Time Account", a new 
service that the member bank plans to offer. 
It is understood that the Time Account plan will consist 
of a time deposit, open account, on which the Bank plans to pay a 
rate of interest not exceeding the applicable maximum rate permit-
ted by section 217.6 of Regulation Q, currently 5 per cent per 
annum. The plan also involves a line of credit granted the de-
positor in the amount, and on the security, of such time deposit. 
The depositor has the privilege of drawing checks on Citizens Bank 
to the extent of this line of credit. The Bank will charge inter-
est on the resulting "check-loans", which are payable upon demand, 
at not l6ss than the rate that may be required in order for the 
Bank to comply with section 217.4(e) of Regulation Q; currently, 
the rate would be 7 per cent. Interest will be charged for the 
exact number of days for which the credit is actually extended by 
the Bank. 
If the operation of the Time Account plan is substantially 
in accordance with the facts presented in the materials accompanying 
the Bank's request, it would appear to the Board that such operation 
would not violate any provision of Regulation Q. 
It would be appreciated if your Bank would transmit the 
substance of this letter to Citizens Bank. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

SUBCHAPTER A - BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
[Reg. A] 
PART 201 - ADVANCES AND DISCOUNTS BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS 
§ 201,108 Obligations eligible as collateral for advances. 
(a) Section 3(a) of Public Law 90-505, approved September 21, 
1968, amended the eighth paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 347) to authorize advances thereunder to member banks 
"secured by such obligations as are eligible for purchase under 
section 14(b) of this Act." The relevant part of such paragraph had 
Previously referred only to "notes . . . eligible . . . for purchase", 
which the Board had construed as not including obligations generally 
regarded as securities. (See 1962 Federal Reserve Bulletin 690, 12 CFR 
201.103(d).) 
(b) Under section 14(b) direct obligations of, and obliga-
tions fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States 
°r any agency thereof are eligible for purchase by Reserve Banks. Follow 
ing are the principal agency obligations now eligible as collateral for 
advances: 
(1) Federal Intermediate Credit Bank debentures, 
(2) Federal Home Loan Bank notes and bonds, 
(3) Federal Land Bank bonds, 

(4) Bank for Cooperative debentures, 
(5) Federal National Mortgage Association notes, 
debentures and guaranteed certificates of 
participation, 
(6) Obligations of or fully guaranteed by the 
Government National Mortgage Association, 
(7) Merchant Marine bonds, 
(8) Exp ort-Import Bank notes and guaranteed 
participation certificates, 
(9) Farmers Home Administration insured notes, 
(10) Notes fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by the Small Business Administration, 
(11) Federal Housing Administration debentures, 
(12) District of Columbia Armory Board bonds, 
(13) Tennessee Valley Authority bonds and notes, 
(14) Bonds and notes of local urban renewal or 
public housing agencies fully supported as to 
principal and interest by the full faith and 
credit of the United States pursuant to 
section 302 of the Housing Act of 1961 
(42 U.S.C. 1421a(c), 1452(c)). 
(c) Nothing less than a full guarantee of principal and 
by a Federal agency will make an obligation eligible. For 
mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration 

-3-
are not eligible since the insurance contract is not equivalent to an 
unconditional guarantee and does not fully cover interest payable on the 
loan. Obligations of international institutions, such as the Inter-
American Development Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, are also not eligible, since such institutions are not 
agencies of the United States. 
(d) Also eligible for purchase under section 14(b) are "bills, 
notes, revenue bonds, and warrants with a maturity from date of purchase 
°f not exceeding six months, issued in anticipation of the collection of 
taxes or in anticipation of the receipt of assured revenues by any State, 
county, district, political subdivision, or municipality in the conti-
nental United States, including irrigation, drainage and reclamation 
districts". To the extent such obligations would be eligible for purchase 
under Part 205 of this chapter (Reg. E), they are now eligible as collat-
eral for advances to metfcber banks. Such obligations should by their terms 
Mature within six months after the date of the advance and be payable out 
specific tax or similar types of revenue and should be otherwise 
eligible for purchase under Part 205.

(No. 25,173, C. A. 5) 
Your Reference: ELW, Jr.:MH:REK 
145-3-865 
Dear Sir: 
Thank you for your letter of October 17 inviting the Board's 
comments in connection with your preparation of a recommendation to 
the Solicitor General as to whether a petition for writ of certiorari 
should be filed in the above case. 
The Board urges that such a petition be filed. The Board 
believes that sufficient question as to the legal correctness of 
the Court of Appeals' dec ision exists to justify review by the 
Supreme Court. Relating to the impact of the decision on the Board's 
functions, the decision casts doubt on the correctness of a number 
of the Board's interpretations in the field of branch banking and 
creates grave uncertainty as to the course the Board should follow 
in the future. 
The following matters are noted: 
Section 5155 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 36), which 
was construed by the Court of Appeals in the above case, is made 

O.J / 
Edwin L. Weisl, Jr., Esq. 
-2-
applicable by the third paragraph of section 9 of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 321) to State banks which are members of the Federal 
Reserve System. The Board has consistently taken the position that 
a determination as to whether an arrangement constitutes a "branch" 
within the meaning of section 5155 is a question of Federal law. 
Although the Court of Appeals' decision is not entirely clear, it 
seems to take the position that this question is to be governed by 
the law of the particular State. 
The decision thus raises a question as to the correctness 
of numerous Board interpretations of long standing which deal with 
determinations as to whether a large variety of arrangements con-
stitute branches, and presents a serious question as to the course 
of future Board actions in such cases. 
It is believed that the Board's position, that the determi-
nation as to whether a facility constitutes a "branch" is a matter of 
Federal law of nationwide uniformity, is supported by subsection (f) 
of section 5155, which provides a partial definition of the term. 
This subsection would be rendered meaningless if the Court of Appeals' 
conclusion that this determination is a matter of State law were to be 
followed. For example, if a State supervisor ruled that an arrangement 
which clearly constituted a "place of business . . . at which deposits 
are received" was not a branch, under the Court's apparent reasoning 
the arrangement would not be a branch for the purposes of section 5155, 
even though it fell squarely within the terms of section 5155(f). 
The Court's conclusion also seems to contravene the principle 
that terms used in Federal statutes have the same meaning throughout 
the United States, in the absence of an indication of Congressional 
intent to the contrary. The terms of section 5155(f) seem to con-
stitute a conclusive indication of Congress' intent that this principle 
is applicable in this situation and that the term "branch" is to be 
given a uniform interpretation regardless of geographical location. 
In view of the legal questions discussed above and the 
administrative uncertainties created by the Court of Appeals' decision, 
it is the Board's judgment that a review of the Court's decision by 
the Supreme Court is desirable. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal
