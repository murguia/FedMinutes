The staff related its under-

Governor Sherrill presented a recommendation that James B. 
Eckert be promoted from the position of Assistant Adviser to Associate 
Adviser in the Division of Research and Statistics, effective May 31,

reassigned to work on special problems in banking and finance and would 
be designated as the Division's contingency planning officer. 
Governor 
Sherrill also noted that in related moves Edward C. Ettin would be 
reassigned in charge of the Banking Section while James Kichline would 
be reassigned as Chief of the Capital Markets Section (nonofficial
