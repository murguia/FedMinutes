First Empire State Corporation. In a memorandum dated 
February 12, 1973, the Division of Supervision and Regulation recom-
mended approval of the application of First Empire State Corporation, 
Buffalo, New York, a bank holding company, for permission for its 
subsidiary, First Empire Bank-New York, New York City, to acquire 
shares of First Empire Bank International N.V., Netherlands Antilles. 
During discussion a question was raised with regard to a 
company of this size establishing an overseas subsidiary and staff 
was asked to provide additional information. The matter was therefore 
deferred. 
Reserve Bank expenditures. Requests had been received from 
several Federal Reserve Banks for additions to the total controllable 
expenditures authorized for the first half of 1973 Reserve Bank budgets. 
In a memorandum dated February 27, 1973, the Committee on Organization, 
Compensation, and Building Plans stated that it had strong reservations 
about granting such requests in light of the Board's concern and its 
recent action to curb rising expenses within the System. The Committee 
r e
commended that the Reserve Banks be urged to direct their efforts 
toward meeting the targeted expense reduction along the lines indicated 
rn a draft letter attached to the memorandum. 
During discussion several changes in the draft letter were 
a
greed upon. However, Governor Brimmer was not in agreement with the 
r
ecommendation of the Committee on Organization. After further discussion,

dissenting. A copy of the letter sent to the Reserve Banks is 
attached as Item No. 5.

to Citizens National Bank in Ennis, Ennis, Texas. 
After a discussion during which questions were raised with 
r
espect to applicant's present control of Citizens National, staff

as requested to provide additional information and the matter was 
therefore deferred.

covered in 1970 within the meaning and intent of section 4(a)(2) of 
the Bank Holding Company Act; and (2) Ribso was not required to 
terminate its present activities. The issuance of a notice to that

complied with South Carolina State law, of the application of NCNB

known as American Trust Company, Inc. The Division stated that the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Board's Division of Super-
vision and Regulation also recommended approval, as did the Banking 
Markets Section. 
During discussion support was expressed for the staff recom-
m e
ndation, but it was believed that the applicant should be given a 
limit of one year in which to complete the transaction. Several changes 
in a draft statement were also agreed upon. The Board thereupon unani-
mously approved the application and authorized issuance of an order 
and statement reflecting that decision. Copies of the order and state-

ration, New York, New York, had requested a Board determination that 
ownership of shares of a pure captive insurance company that Chase 
proposed to organize under Colorado law to underwrite insurance for 
Chase Manhattan Corporation and its banking subsidiaries would fall 
within the exemption of section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act, In a memorandum dated March 5, 1973, the Legal Division recom-
mended that the Board determine that ownership of shares of a pure 
c

TO THE fl O A(-< o 
March 8, 1973 
An a first step in a major effort to control the rate of 
St cwtrh in Federal Reserve System expenditures, the Board, in January, 
asked each Reserve Bank to reduce, its budgeted total controllable 
e
*Pert.-.-n by 2.47,. 
Since that time--and, in some cases, before the Board had 
completed its review of Bank budgets--several Banks have requested 
omental adjustments to their new controllable expense targets, 
lysis of the pur-pose and nature of the requested increases shows: 
Lost represent expenditures not identified during 
the budget preparation cycle—some were not identi-
fiable until after the completion of Bank budgets. 
Most are identified with worthwhile programs--some 
seem almost, unavoidable, 
In normal circumstances, approval would be a 
relatively simple decision, 
t 
( 
The Board does not wish arbitrarily to act in such a way as 
V 
thhold previously approved employee salary adjustments, deny 
"tj'

recognition action to worthy Bank staff, delay essen-
. • ^quipiaent or. facility expenditures or thwart identified high-
•Verity programs to improve operations and services. 
It directs 
attention to reductions in the low-priority items, even though 
^
 (
 °-du<?,d in Ion? continued operating practices. Bank management teams 
to review their budgets with the aim of effecting offsetting

^foreseen costs related to essential or high-priority programs,

As evidenced by recent actions such as the establishment of

bud^i-s it established in January,

It is understood Lhat eorae uaevenness is inherent in the 
impact of an overall expense limitation. Xn the current critical 
cecumstances, however, the Board depends on--and appreciates—the 
m
^jor contribution of Reserve Bank management toward seeking every 
tentative means by which to accomplish improvement without raising 
c
°st levels.

Applicant, with its substantial resources and statewide orientation, is 
financially and legally able (through its subsidiary banks in Westchester 
and Dutchess counties) to branch de novo into Rockland County. In addition,

ch multi-bank holding company headquartered in New York State (except 
Security New York Corp., Rochester) has at least one subsidiary bank in the 
T h

 the basis of the facts of record, the Board concludes that considerations

The financial and managerial resources of Applicant and its sub-

appear to be satisfactory and future prospects are favorable. The 
^ a g e r i a l resources and future prospects of Bank are good. While the Board

Sards the present capital position of Bank as low, Applicant has committed

 this proposal would enable Bank to broaden and improve the range of

^atio 
n a
l Bank, Charlotte, North Carolina ("Bank"), the second largest 
j 
North Carolina. Bank engages in a fiduciary business, but 
n
°t and may not solicit trust business in South Carolina due 
th 
e
 enactment in 1970 of a statute In South Carolina which, 

-2-
i n
 effect, prohibits foreign corporations domiciled or licensed 
in 
n a
 State contiguous to South Carolina from serving as testamentary 
t r
ustee of an estate of a South Carolina domiciliary (§ 67-53 Code 
S l j g w s of South Carolina 1962 (1971 Cum. Supp.)). NCNB also controls 
T r u
s t Company of Florida, Orlando, Florida, which does not compete 
s i
8ftificantly in South Carolina, 
C . Douglas Wilson & Co., Inc., 
t h e 
l a
* g e s t mortgage banking firm in South Carolina, and Stephenson 
Pin 
a t l
ce Company, Inc., a South Carolina corporation engaged in lend-
i a
g and leasing activities, are also subsidiaries of NCNB. 
Neither 
n
8ages in trust company activities. 
A T C , a newly-formed corporation, would operate from a 
s i r i
gle o f f i c e in Camden. There is presently no trust company or 
t r U s t
 department office in Camden. However, there are presently 
a n
k trust offices in Columbia, located thirty miles from Camden, 
trust officers from these offices make regularly-scheduled trips 
to Camden and apparently are on call at less than an hour's notice 
to 
G e t
 in Camden with trust customers residing there. 
Represented 
n
g these six offices are the three largest banks in South Carolina 
together account for approximately 78 per cent of the personal 
a
s s e t s held by the at least 22 corporations that are trustees 
i t X
 S o u t h Carolina. 
Several South Carolina government officials, banks, and 
b a t
*ker » 
r s
 
associations have objected to the proposal of NCNB on 
grounds, one of which is that presently the trust needs of 
and South CavoJinn reorient-« m c being adequately m e t . 
Further, 

-2-
the objectors have contended that entry into South Carolina by 
NCNB through the instrumentality of ATC will set what they con-
sider an undesirable precedent for entry into South Carolina 
t r
ust markets by out-of-State bank holding companies. Apart 
f r
o m the question of the desirability of such a precedent, such 
Ejections ignore the role of this Board and that of the South 
C a
*olina Board of Bank Control, both of which may withhold neces-
8 a r
y prior approvals where the effect of bank holding company 
et
*try would be adverse to the public interest. Further, the 
B
°ard questions the characterization of the entry of additional 
c
°mpetitors into South Carolina trust markets as undesirable. 
record in this matter discloses sufficient evidence for 
the 
e
 Board to conclude reasonably that corporate-held personal 
ruot- assets are highly concentrated in the hands of the three 
l a r
8est South Carolina banks. The entry of NCNB into South 
ar
°lina may serve to reduce this concentration by the introduction 
of a t l
 additional alternative source for personal trust services; 
thi 
s
 Vould constitute, in the Board's view, a substantial public 
benef i t B 
In addition, although present trust needs of the Camden 
South Carolina communities are presently being adequately 
served 
u 
> the Board may not ignore the fact that greater service 
^
 r G
sult from the entry of another qualified competitor. This 
^eater-
service derives from more than just the greater convenience 

864 
-4-
t o
 Camden residents of the location of a full-time trust office 
in their community. 
It derives primarily from the fact that 
NCNB'S entry will increase competition by the reasonably 
^ticipated increase in services and a heightened quality of 
listing services rather than in rate competition. The likelihood 
hat present South Carolina corporate trustees may be required 
0
 increase the number of services offered and the quality of 
tho 
s
e services in order to remain competitive constitutes a 
°gnizable public benefit directly flowing from the proposed 
t r
*nsaction. 
The public benefits enumerated above which are expected 
to K 
6
 produced by the performance of trust services by ATC in 
u t
h Carolina outweigh, in the Board's judgment, any possible 
V e r s e
 effects of the proposal. The Board considers as wholly 
P G c
ulative allegations contained in the record that the proposal 
*ead to undue concentration of economic resources or will 
in decreased or unfair competition. 
It is obvious that 
entry will not have an immediate effect of unduly con-
t l r a
ting resources, for Applicant's proposal does not contemplate 
a C (
luisition of an existing company nor is there any evidence 
e
ither the purpose or effect of the proposal is or will be 
P r e
e m p t entry into any area. To the contrary, it has been 
e d
 that the proposal, if consummated, will encourage 

si; 
O t ) 
-5-
^
u
rther entry by other bank holding companies. Apparently, it 
j 
s
 this further entry in combination with NCNB's proposed entry 
fc
hat i s a t 
t h e heart of the contention that the proposal will 
r e
sult in a n 
u n d u e concentration of economic resources. Although 
5
 ^(c)(8) of the Act directs this Board to consider "possible" 
Averse effects of bank holding company actions, the amount of 
V e i
g h t accorded to "possible" adverse effects depends directly 
U p
°
n
 the likelihood of the occurrence of such effects. The 
r e C o r d
 neither identifies likely additional entrants nor rebuts 
th 
G
 Previously-stated position that the Board itself stands as 
harrier to entry where entry would be adverse to the public 
itite 
r
est. The contention that the proposal will lead to undue 
Or
*centration of resources further underestimates the competitive 
staying abilities of South Carolina banks that presently 
f f G r
 trust services. Endowed with reputations already familiar 
their potential trust customers and with the ability to offer 
stop full service banking, these banks will possess a con-
d e
r a b l e competitive advantage over ATC and any newly-formed 
r e i
£n-.controlled trust company which would necessarily lack 
8 U c h
 advantages. 
The contention is also made that the smaller South 
CaroXi 
banks which presently offer trust services, allegedly 
Q s
 a i 
*°ss leader to draw deposit business, will be unable to 

-2-
successfully compete with ATC and will, as a result of the 
Proposed transaction, be forced out of the trust business. 
However, the objectors have presented little more than bare 
allegations to this effect. The Board does not believe this 
contention to have reasonable probability in the light of the 
continued presence of these small banks in the trust business 
d e
s p i t e the presence of the larger South Carolina banks in that 
business; the expressed intention of ATC to compete primarily 
£ 
°r the larger accounts that are presently being won by the 
larger South Carolina banks, but to a more substantial degree 
t t l a t a r e
 being entrusted to individual trustees; and the 
inability of ATC to accept deposits. In any case, the Bank 
Company Act does not authorize the Board, nor is the 
B
°ard inclined, to shield competitors from the impact of fair 
competition. 
In brief, since the Board believes that the likelihood 
^at the instant proposal will lead to an undue concentration 
f
 Resources is considerably less than probable, the Board 
e e i B s 
t h e
 possible adverse effects to be of little weight. 
Contentions have also been made that the proposal 
result in decreased competition. NCNB presently does 
not 
compete for trust business in South Carolina. Its entry 
into t-h 
c
nat business in South Carolina will not, in the foreseeable 
f u t u r e 
result in a decrease in existing competition in the South 

-7 
' 867 
Carolina markets for trust services, and, as noted above, the 
Board does not believe that the proposal will result in a 
decrease in existing competition even as a long-term effect. 
Absent evidence indicating that de novo entry in a particular 
case will either have the purpose or effect of foreclosing 
future competition, such entry is generally considered a 
healthy competitive development. The record shows that the 
instant proposal may encourage future entry rather than fore-
close such entry. 
It has also been contended that the proposal 
w
i
U result in unfair competition. The Board finds no evidence 
in the record which would support such a conclusion. Nor does 
t h e
 Board find any evidence of conflicts of interests or un-
sound banking practices in the record. 
During the making of the record in this case, certain 
b
U l s were pending in the South Carolina legislature which were 
e t l
acted, signed, and became effective subsequent to the oral 
Presentation in this matter. These statutes (§§ 19-592 and 
6 7
-53( a)(3) of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1962) appear, 
arn
°ng other effects, to prohibit any corporation controlled 
^ a foreign corporation from serving as an executor, administrator, 
r
 ^
e
stamentary trustee in South Carolina. 
In Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish v . Bank 
^ - ^ H j Q r l e a n s & Trust Co., 379 U.S. 411 (1965) the United 
St 
a t e
s Supreme Court stated: 
• .the Board could not approve the holding com-
pany arrangement involving the organization and 
opening of a new bank if the opening of the bank, 

-2-
by reason of its ownership by a bank holding 
company, would be prohibited by a valid State 
law.
1
' (p. 419) 
T
he Board believes that if an application under section 4(c)(8) 
°f the Act contemplated action that would clearly and totally 
b e
 prohibited by State law, the language of Whitney would 
S q u i r e the Board to deny that application. 
However, in the 
instant case, only certain of the activities contemplated 
by NCNB appear to be clearly prohibited by South Carolina law. 
U n d e r 
t h a
t law, ATC could, assuming that it is able to secure 
t h
e approval of the South Carolina Board of Bank Control, still 
S e
rve as an inter vivos or corporate trustee and act as an 
investment and financial adviser. Accordingly, and since 
e
 Board would approve the entire proposal but for the above-
c i t
e d South Carolina statutes, the Board believes that it may 
a
Pprove the proposal to the extent permitted by South Carolina 
law. 
Counsel for NCNB, citing the Whitney case as authority, 
a s 
U r
g e d that, in the event the Board finds the pertinent 
°
u
th Carolina statutes applicable to this proposal, the Board 
Proceed to consider the constitutional validity of the 
Statute 
TN 
Despite language to the contrary in the dissenting 
^niori of M r . Justice Douglas in Whitney» which was joined by 
Justice Black, the Board does not believe that it is bound 
to read the majority opinion in Whitney so broadly. In the Board's 

judgment, it possesses neither the authority nor the expertise to 
Pass on the constitutional validity of State statutes. 
Accordingly, 
t h
e Board declines to trespass into what has traditionally been 
the exclusive province of the judiciary by considering the con-
s t
itutional issue raised. 
In the light of the above, it is the Board's judgment 
that the proposal is in the public interest and should be approved 
t o
 the extent presently permitted by State law.

March 3, 1973 
C. Haberkern, Jr., Esq. 
bank, Tweed, Hadley & MeCioy 
\ Chase Manhattan Plaza 
N e w

near Mr. Haberkern: 
On behalf of The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("CMC"), 
have requested Board confirmation that shares of a "pure captive 
-nsurar.ee company" ("PCIC") formed under Article 36 of Chapter 72 of 
Colorado Revised Statutes, 1963, as amended* that CMC proposes to have 
^ganized fall within the exemption of § 4(c)(1)(C) of the Bank 
1 
Company Act, That provision exempts from the prohibitions 
V
-Sair»«?t acquisitions by bank holding companies ''shares of any 
ecupany engaged or to be engaged solely in . , . furnishing services 
or performing services for such bank holding company or its 
inking subsidiaries." 
It is our understanding thai: the proposed PCIC would 
Provide insurance for CMC and its banking subsidiaries against risks, 
/
l
2ards, and liabilities for which insurance is not available in 
^isurance markets in the United States or is available only at 
^oessive rates or with unreasonable deductibles. It is further 
^^derstood that CMC is primarily concerned with the bankers' blanket 
^overage of CMC and The Chase. Manhattan National Bank, N.A., which 
^ available only with a deductible of S500.000. You propose, 
^-refcre, that the PCIC to be formed will insure the first $500,000 
q 
which Is riot covered by such bor.d and any lesser amounts 
b
 
a r e 
T l n t
 covered by bankers' blanket: bonds issued to other 
anking subsidiaries of CMC. 
. 
The underlying rationale for your conclusion that the 
£ °pooed activicics fall within the § 4(c)(1)(C) exemption appears 
b e
 that CMC and its banking subsidiaries are merely seeking to 
^ 
v„,i, tii'.v. j. 
u till 
ov uo t-\.< i. ci-.v 
o t. u 
txjr owwvaii^ > 
r ~
,u
re through a subsidiary corporation certain risks which are 
~ • rently self-insured because of the unavailability of suitable 
t r a n c e coverage. 
j 
Based on the legislative history cf the Act, the Board 
avJJ Stated that "the term services, while sometimes used in a broad 
S-neral sense $ appears to be somewhat mere liwired in its appli-

-2-
1/ 
cation in section 4(c)(1) of the Bank Holding C o m p a n y Act." 
The 
Board has also stated that "This legislative history and the context 
in which the term services is used in section 4(c)(1) seem to 
suggest that the term was in general intended to refer to servicing 
operations which a bank could carry on itself, but which the bank^ 
^ J 
holding company chooses to have, done through another organization."
-
Furthermore, the Board has generally taken the view that the types of 
servicing permissible under § 4(c)(1) arc. to be distinguished from 
activities of a finanical, fiduciary or insurance nature which might 
b
e considered for possible exemption under § 4(c)(8) of the Holding 
Company Act. And the Board has ruled that the activities of^ 
underwriting credit life insurance and comprehensive automobile 
insurance do not fall within the purview of § 4 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( C ) T h e 
B
°ard is not unmindful that the present proposal does not involve any 
customer contact. However that aspect does not by itself render the 
activity a "service". The Board has indicated that a holding company 
seeking to sell, as an agent, insurance for the holding company or its 
subsidiaries is to be treated under § 4(c)(8) rather than § 4(c)(1)(C). 
In thi light of legislative history, Board rules pertaining 
t o
 insurance agencies, Board public statements concerning permissible 
insurance underwriting activities of bank holding companies, and 
fc
earing in mind the high degree of controversy .surrounding any bank 
h i d i n g company entry into the insurance underwriting .'.rw, the Board 
concludes that the proposed activities are not within the exemption 
o f 
5
 4(c)(1)(C). 
Further, it is the Board's judgment that a § 4(c)(8) 
a
PPlication, which would permit a full public airing of the issues 
involved in permitting bank holding companies to form PCICs to insure 
t V i
e deductible portion oL" bankers' blanket bond insurance, is the 
e d i t a b l e and appropriate route for bank holding companies seeking 
t:
° engage in this activity. 
Very truly yours,
