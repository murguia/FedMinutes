The Board approved the applications of The Citizens Agency, 
Inc., Minneapolis, Kansas, to become a bank holding company through 
acquisition of additional shares of The Citizens National Bank of 
Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Kansas, and to continue to engage in insur-
ance agency activities. The Board authorized issuance of an order

The Board approved the application of First Security Bank 
of Missoula, Missoula, Montana, for membership in the Federal Reserve 
System. A copy of the letter sent to the bank is attached as Item No. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Report on H.R. 4988. A memorandum from Mr. Rippey dated 
March 16, 1973, was accompanied by a draft letter to respond to a 
request from Chairman St Germain of the Subcommittee on Bank Supervi-
sion and Insurance of the House Banking and Currency Committee for 
the Board's views on H.R. 4988, a bill to authorize Federal savings and 
loan associations and national banks to own stock in and make loans 
to certain State housing corporations. The letter would recommend 
that the Subcommitee consider substituting the language of a draft 
bill the Board had proposed in 1971, which would accomplish not only 

3/19/73 
-3-
the purpose of H.R. 4988—to increase the supply of housing for low-
and moderate-income families—but also would permit somewhat broader 
participation by banks in community development projects. 
After discussion during which changes in the draft were agreed 
upon, the transmittal of a letter reflecting those revisions was 
approved, A copy of the letter in the form transmitted is attached 
as Item No. 5. 
Chairman Burns joined the meeting at this point, as did the 
following: 
Mr. Holland, Executive Director 
Mr. Feldberg, Assistant Secretary 
Mr. Plotkin, Assistant General Counsel 
Mr. Leavitt, Deputy Director, Division of 
Supervision and Regulation 
The staff presented a review of the money and capital markets 
and monetary aggregates. Copies of the statistical materials prepared 
for the review have been placed in the Board's files, as well as 
copies of the individual briefings. 
The meeting proceeded from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Testimony on "NOW" accounts. At the meeting on March 16, 1973, 
the Board discussed a draft statement to be presented by Governor 
Mitchell on March 21 before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions 
of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 
principally with respect to the implications of "NOW" accounts recently

offered by savings banks in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in which 
funds might be transferred from savings deposits through the use of 
negotiable orders of withdrawal tantamount to checks. Two bills 
relating to the problem had been introduced: one sponsored by-
Mr. St Germain would prohibit such accounts, at least for the time 
being; one sponsored by Senator Mclntyre would legitimize them. A 
revised draft of the statement to be presented by Governor Mitchell 
had now been distributed. The statement contained a suggestion for 
a three-part legislative program that in essence would move toward 
equity among different types of financial institutions in terms of 
money transfer services provided through this type of "family accounts," 
interest rate ceilings, and reserve requirements. 
Discussion turned principally on the relative emphasis to be 
given to the longer-term considerations of the benefits to public 
convenience to be derived from the family-type of accounts and the 
shorter-run problem of competitive inequity between commercial banks 
and mutual savings banks in New England. It was agreed that the latter 
should be given the greater emphasis. 
It was understood that, with further revisions to reflect 
elements of the discussion, the statement would be presented in a 
final form satisfactory to Governor Mitchell. (A copy of the statement 
in the form in which it was presented has been placed in the Board's 
files.)

Governor Daane withdrew during the preceding discussion. 
Payments mechanism. On March 15 and 16, 1973, the Board 
discussed a second draft of a response to an inquiry from Chairman 
St Germain of the Subcommittee on Bank Supervision and Insurance of 
the House Committee on Banking and Currency regarding the relationship 
of savings and loan associations to the various developing systems 
for the electronic transfer of funds. At Governor Mitchell's 
suggestion, an additional footnote had been drafted by Mr. O'Connell, 
which was set forth in a memorandum of March 16 from Mr. Rippey. 
The letter was approved, with the additional footnote, 
subject to review by Chairman Burns. The letter was subsequently 
transmitted in the form attached as Item No. 6. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Item No. 2 
3/19/73 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
THE CITIZENS AGENCY, INC. 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company 
and Continuation of Insurance Agency Activities 
The Citizens Agency, Inc., Minneapolis, Kansas, has applied for 
the Board's approval, under § 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(1)), of formation of a bank holding company through 
acquisition of an additional 60 per cent or more of the voting shares of 
The Citizens National Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Kansas ("Bank"). 
Applicant at present oxms 22 per cent of the voting shares of Bank. 
Consummation of the proposal would result in Applicant owning all shares 
Bank except for directors' qualifying shares. 
At the same time, Applicant has applied for the Board's 
approval under § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and § 225.4(b)(2) 
the Board's Regulation Y for Applicant to continue to engage in the 
activities of a general insurance agency in a community of less than 5,000 
Persons. 
Notice of receipt of the applications has been given in accordance 
with §§ 3 and 4 of the Act, and the time for filing comments and views has 
expired. The Board has considered the applications in light of the factors 
Set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)), and the considerations 
specified in § 4(c)(8) of the Act. 
Applicant (wholly owned by a husband and wife) presently owns 
110 shares of Ba.ik and proposes to acquire an additional 300 shares of 
^ank from Applicant's own shareholders. Bank, with deposits of $5.7 
million, is the lar.ger of two banks in Minneapolis and the third largest of 

* <J54 
- 2 -
five banks in Ottawa County. (All banking data are as of June 30, 1972). 
On the facts herein and particularly since the transaction involves only a 
change from individual to corporate ownership of a single bank, consummation 
of the proposal will have no adverse effects on existing or potential com-
petition. 
Considerations relating to financial and managerial resources 
and prospects of Applicant and Bank appear to be generally satisfactory and 
consistent with approval. Although Applicant will assume debt incurred by 
its owners when Bank shares were acquired, it appears that such debt may 
be adequately serviced without placing an undue strain on Bank earnings. 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the communities 
involved, with respect to the acquisition of Bank, are consistent with 
aPproval. It is the Board's judgment that the transaction would be in the 
Public interest and that the application to acquire Bank should be approved. 
Applicant has operated a general insurance agency from Bank's 
Premises in Minneapolis (population approximately 2,000) since 1967. The 
insurance agency was established de novo by Applicant. Net commissions for 
l97l and 1972 were reported to be respectively, $8,600 and $13,600. The 
^°ard has previously determined by regulation that the conduct of a general 
insurance agency in a community of less than 5,000 persons is closely 
related to banking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)(iii)(a)). The evidence shows that 
there are five competing insurance agencies. There is no evidence in the 
record indicating that consummation of the proposal would result in any 
undue concentration of resources, unfair competition, conflicts of interest, 
unsound banking practices, or other adverse effects on the public interest. 

9 5 5

It does appear that approval of the application will assure the community 
of Minneapolis of the continued operation of a convenient alternative source 
of insurance agency services. Based upon the foregoing and other considera-
tions reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the public 
interest factors that the Board is required to consider regarding the 
continuation of Applicant's insurance agency activities are favorable and the 
application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications to acquire Bank shares 
and to continue to engage in insurance agency activities are approved for the 
reasons summarized above. The acquisition of Bank shares shall not be con-
summated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date 
of this Order nor (b) later than three months after the effective date of this 
°rder, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, or by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City pursuant to delegated authority. The 
determination as to the insurance agency activities is subject to the 
conditions set forth in § 225.4(c) of Regulation Y and to the Board's 
authority to require such modification or termination of the activities 
°f a holding company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary

Item No. 3 
3/19/73 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
MANUFACTURERS HANOVER CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, Dover, Delaware, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, 
has applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)), to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares 
of State Bank of Ontario, Ontario, New York ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired 
and the Board has considered the application and all comments received 
in light of the factors sat forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
1842(c)). 
Applicant is the third largest banking organization in New 
York, controlling four banks with aggregate deposits of $9.2 billion, 
representing approximately nine and a half per cent of all deposits of 
commercial banks in the State.1/ Acquisition of Bank (deposits of 
$20.1 million) would constitute Applicant's initial entry into the 
Rochester banking market and would not change Applicant's ranking 
among banking organizations in the State, nor would it significantly 
increase the concentration of banking resources in New York. 
I7~aTI" banking data are as of June 30, 1972, except where otherwise 
noted, and are adjusted to reflect bank holding company formations and 
acquisitions approved by the Board through February 28, 1973. 

Bank is the seventh largest of 16 banks in the Rochester 
banking market, controlling 1 per cent of total deposits in that 
market J J 
(Banking data for the Rochester market are as of June 30, 
1970.) Applicant's nearest banking subsidiary to Bank is approximately 
200 miles distant and it does not appear that any meaningful competition 
exists between Bank and any of Applicant's subsidiary banks. Further, 
it .seems unlikely that meaningful competition would develop in the 
near future between Bank and any of Applicant's banking subsidiaries 
in light of the facts presented, notably, the distance separating 
these banks and New York's statutes prohibiting Applicant's banking 
subsidiaries from branching into the Rochester market until 1976. 
Moreover, the introduction of Applicant as a vigorous competitor into 
the Rochester market could be beneficial in vi$w of the concentrated 
nature of that market (the four largest banking organizations control 
92 per cent of market deposits), and would not raise barriers to 
entry by other banking companies since seven independent banks would 
remain as potential members of other bank holding companies. On the 
basis of the record before it, the Board concludes that consummation 
of the proposal herein would have no adverse effects on competition 
in any relevant area. 
The financial condition, managerial resources, and future 
prospects of Applicant, its subsidiary banks and Bank appear generally 
satisfactory and are consistent with the approval of the application. 
2/ The Rochester banking market is approximated by Wayne and Monroe 
Counties and the northern half of Livingston County. 

-3 
3 5 9 
Considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the community 
to be served are also consistent with, and lend weight toward, approval 
of the application, since Applicant through Bank will be able to provide 
additional services at a more convenient location for many customers 
in the Rochester area. Among the services which Bank does not presently 
offer but will provide as a result of its affiliation with Applicant 
are: expanded trust and loan and credit services, a wider variety of 
consumer financing, international banking services, and computer 
services. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the proposed 
acquisition would be in the public interest and that the application 
should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
this Order, or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board 
°r by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

be confined to the State in which the national bank is located. 
If there is a public purpose to be served in permitting national 
banks to invest in State housing corporations, then such a 
limitation is unnecessary. There are many instances where a bank 
in a major city is locatcd at the border of one State and its 
market area extends into an adjacent State. 
Also, a limitation on investments in State housing 
corporations should not include within the limitation "loans and 
commitments for loans" as H.R. 4988 would do. It would not appear 
necessary to place any additional restrictions on the lending 
powers of the banks; rather, a limitation on equity investments, 
as in the Board's proposal, would suffice. 
With regard to H.R. 4070, I am enclosing a copy of a 
statement of the Board's views on the extension of flexible 
interest rate ceiling authority and the development of negotiable 
orders of withdrawal for use by savings account customers. 
I hope these comments and the enclosed material will 
prove helpful to you and your subcommittee. Please let me know 
if I can be of further assistance.

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain, Chairman 
Subcommittee on Bank Supervision and Insurance 
Committee on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I am writing in further response to your letter of 
January 24 regarding the relationship of savings and loan asso-
ciations to the various developing systems for the electronic 
transfer of funds. More particularly, you inquire about the 
participation of California savings and loan associations in 
the program developed by the Special Committee on Paperless 
Entries (SCOPE) in California, now known by its operational 
title of California. Automated Clearing House Association (CACHA). 
The SCOPS program was undertaken, with die cooperation 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, by a group of com-
mercial banks in California during the period 1968-1972.1/ It 
represents one approach developed by banks working together to 
achieve a system for electronic transfers of funds. This system, 
which covers legal and administrative arrangements as well as 
extensive software design for electronic equipment, provides for 
the creation of an automated clearing house to be operated by ' 
'•f^LRt^ 
1/ Subsequently, SCOPE-type programs were set up in 22 additional 
areas: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, 
Kansas City, Long Island, Milwaukee, New York, Fniladelphia, 
Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, Seattle, and the Twin Cities. 
The Atlanta System, referred to as "COPE," is expected to begin 
operations in 1973. The Twin Cities committee includes 
Minnesota's only mutual savings bank as an associate member. 
A large Minneapolis savings and loan association has also 
applied for associate membership. The Twin Cities project is 
expected to become operational in early 1974. (Associate 
members participate in planning discussions, but do not have 
voting rights or participate in costs.) 

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain

the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, as an interface among 
banks. The arrangement is intended to provide a mechanism whereby 
bank depositors can transfer funds into, and out of, their demand 
deposit accounts through the use of "paperless entries" rather 
than checks, and whereby banks can exchange such entries and make 
settlements among themselves with respect to them. Such an 
electronic system recognizes the inefficiencies and limitations 
of the existing check system. Its planning was encouraged, and, 
in limited ways, supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco. 
The electronic system parallels the existing check 
clearing system in its clearing and settlement arrangements among 
banks and the Federal Reserve. Access to this new mechanism is 
provided by magnetic tapes, or punched cards, generated by a par-
ticipating institution. The tapes or cards contain instructions — 
substituting for checks—concerning debit and credit transactions 
on behalf of the banks' customers. 
According to our information, the California Savings and 
Loan League approached the California Automated Clearing House 
Association in July 1972 and inquired about participation as 
financial intermediaries in the newly-formed electronic system. 
VJe are informed that since that time, CACHA has received several 
applications for membership from savings and loan associations, 
but has held them in abeyance pending consideration of a number 
of legal and technical questions. We understand that CACHA plans 
further discussions with the California Savings and Loan League. 
In the light of these plans, we have no reason to believe at this 
time that CACHA members have engaged in an unlawful boycott in vio-
lation of the letter or spirit of the antitrust laws. I can assure 
you that: the Federal Reserve System does not intend to permit 
Federal Reserve facilities to be used in any arrangements which 
violate these laws. 
As we understand it, savings and loan associations in 
California wish to participate in the CACHA arrangements primarily 
for the purpose of receiving credits to customer accounts arising 
out of direct deposit of payrolls. Presumably, at some future 
time they might wish to use the SCOPE system for preauthorized 
disbursements or debit transfers. It may be of interest to note 
that presently there exists a system, known as "Transmatic," under 
which a savings and loan association with prior authorization can 
draw checks on its customers' commercial bank checking accounts,

payable to the savings and loan association, for such purposes as 
mortgage payments, deposits to savings accounts, and for certain 
other types of third-party payments related generally to housing 
expenses, including such items as utility bills. 
The Federal Reserve regards its role in expediting and 
accommodating money transfers as highly important. Congress has 
authorized the Federal Reserve to provide a clearing system for 
the handling of checks drawn on one bank and presented to another. 
This clearing system, however, is not all inclusive. For example, 
checks drawn on a few banks that do not clear at par must be pre-
sented to those banks directly or through another commercial bank. 
Large volumes of checks, in addition, are directly exchanged or pre-
sented through city clearing houses operated by commercial banks. 
These items are not routed through the Federal Reserve System; 
although in cities where the Federal Reserve has an office, the 
Federal Reserve office is ordinarily a member of the clearing 
house for the purpose of presenting and receiving checks. The 
net transfer of funds may sometimes be settled in correspondent 
balances, but settlements of any significant volume are made on 
the books of the Federal Reserve. 
These settlements and payments are made possible at 
minimal cost to the economy because member banks keep accounts 
at Federal Reserve Banks, and the Reserve Banks, in turn, maintain 
balances for nationwide settlements. Thus, a bank in New York 
or Providence can buy bonds issued by the Slate Treasurer of 
California in Sacramento, and pay for them by asking the New York 
or Boston Reserve Bank to transfer funds by wire from its reserve 
account to the reserve account of the State Treasurer's bank at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The final step in 
payment, or settlement, is made by transfers within the inter-
district settlement fund by the Reserve Banks involved. Similarly, 
an automobile dealer in Providence or New York can pay for a 
shipment from a Detroit manufacturer by a check that will be 
collected through the Federal Reserve Banks, with settlement made 
through the inter-district settlement fund, just as it was for the 
bonds. Thus, the reserve balances required of member banks at 
the Federal Reserve Banks, in addition to providing a fulcrum for 
the operation of monetary policy, constitute a fundamental instru-
ment for effectuation of the trillions of dollars in money payments 
made annually in our economy. 
Turning to your inquiry about the Board's position on 
the general question of including savings and loan associations 
in electronic funds transfer systems, we believe three general 

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
-4-
mis 
principles apply. First, the Board believes that so far as public 
participation and support are concerned, there should be a single, 
integrated nationwide mechanism for efficient transfer of funds. 
The existing system, using checks and drafts and functioning 
through commercial banks and the Federal Reserve Banks, is sub-
stantially of that character. In this connection, the Federal 
Reserve's Steering Committee on Improving the Payments Mechanism 
issued a statement in December elaborating on this and other 
points, and I am enclosing a copy of it for your use. 
Second, even allowing for the existence of private 
clearing arrangements, the Board believes that the public system 
using check or electronic transfers of funds from one institution 
to another should be such as to insure that the conditions of entry 
into a general clearing arrangement are fair, and that equitable 
treatment is assured for institutions with similar powers and 
responsibilities. The presence of a public agency, such as the 
Federal Reserve, in any cooperative arrangement for transferring 
funds between institutions should be one way of insuring the public 
interest will be taken into account, and that no private clearing 
arrangement may be used to protect or enhance the market position 
of the participating banks at the expense of others. Whatever 
public action is taken, the innovative capabilities of banks and 
other financial institutions to improve money transfer services 
should be recognised and given opportunity for development. And 
of necessity, some innovations will involve cooperation among 
private financial institutions exclusively. 
Third, the costs of the transfer system and the benefits 
of participating in it should be equitably distributed among all 
of the institutions involved. As implied above, the Board 
believes in comparable treatment for institutions having like 
powers, but the existing situation fails to meet this standard. 
Some institutions, namely nonmember banks, have a competitive 
advantage.-- 
These banks do not maintain reserve accounts in the 
2./ Exemplifying the existing advantage enjoyed by nonmember banks is 
the present structure of reserve requirements imposed on such banks 
by their respective States. Although in most States the nominal 
reserve percentage is comparable to that imposed on member banks--
. and in some States may even be higher than Federal Reserve require-
ments--in all States nonmember banks are permitted to carry their 
reserves in the form of what are effectively earning assets: 
Government obligations and correspondent balances. These corre-
spondent balances, although technically noninterest-bearing, are 
a form of indirect compensation to the correspondent banks, which 
in turn compensates the nonmember bank through providing services 
such as check processing, accounting, investment advice, and the like. 

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
- 2 -
Federal Reserve System--accounts which do not earn interest—but 
nevertheless are accorded certain Federal Reserve check clearing 
services deemed essential to the public's need for prompt money" 
payment. If, in the future, extensive checking account powers 
are developed for savings institutions, the extension of the 
benefits of the payments mechanism, whether conventional or 
electronic, to such institutions, without their assuming a fair 
share of the costs, would exacerbate existing inequities. 
In the present framework, direct access to the portion 
of the nation's payments mechanism that depends on Federal Reserve 
facilities is limited to commercial banks and the U.S. Treasury. 
Member banks of the Federal Reserve System currently may send all 
of their checks directly to Federal Reserve processing centers 
for clearing. Nonmember banks may send checks drawn on banks 
within a limited clearing zone to the Federal Reserve, but payment 
or receipt for checks going through the Federal Reserve collection 
system is typically made by debit or credit to an account main-
tained by a member commercial bank at a Federal Reserve Bank. For 
providing clearing services to nonmembers, member banks generally 
receive compensation through the maintenance by nonmember banks 
of "compensating" balances at the member banks. The effective 
costs of these arrangements are determined by competition among 
the various correspondent banks offering the services. 
One method of providing a savings institution access 
to electronic transfers—a method which involves a minimal change 
from present practices--would be for the institution to arrange 
for a member bank to receive electronic debits and credits for 
the account of the savings institution and to provide the detailed 
electronic accounting entries required to effect the transfers to 
customers' accounts at the savings institution. This indirect 
procedure is entirely feasible from a technological standpoint, 
and is a service that could be supplied savings and loan associa-
tions on a competitive basis by various member banks. 
A possible, future alternative would be to provide savings 
and loan associations, or any banking or thrift institution, with 
direcjL access to an automated clearing house operated by the 
Federal Re serve. Such access could be conditioned on membership 
(or perhaps some more limited participation) in the Federal Reserve 
System. In addition to clearing facilities, such participation 

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
-X>-
might be designed to include other important services, such as 
limited access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and coin 
and currency distribution arrangements. It should, however, en-
tail conformance to appropriate interest rate ceilings and System 
reserve requirements. Should Congress decide on a major move of 
this kind, the Board would, of course, review its reserve require-
ments and interest rate ceiling structure with a view toward the 
possibility of greater differentiation among types of accounts, 
and the easing of the transition to the maintenance of reserve 
balances. 
With regard to reserve requirements, the Federal Reserve 
has for some time recommended that all depository institutions 
that offer checking account services be required to maintain 
reserve accounts with the Federal Reserve System. As the payments 
mechanism evolves, and if it becomes necessary for all types of 
depository institutions to participate more fully in it, this 
recommendation of the Board takes on a more pressing aspect. The 
Board therefore urges that, in any investigation into the place 
and role of financial institutions in the payments mechanism, the 
extension of requirements for maintenance of reserve balances at 
the Federal Reserve be considered for all institur.icns providing, 
or seeking to provide, the transfer of funds on a demand basis. 
Part of the Federal Reserve's concern that reserve 
requirements apply to ail depository institutions has been the 
growing volume of financial transactions outside of member banking 
institutions. With respect to commercial banks, for instance, 
fully one-quarter of the increase in demand deposits over the 
past decade has been at nonmember institutions. Yet all demand 
deposits, whether they be in member banks., nonmember banks, mutual 
savings banks, or savings and loan associations, are equally a 
part of the nation's money supply. Uniform applicability of reserve 
requirements—as well as uniform applicability of interest rate 
ceilings to the various deposit classes--is urgently needed, on 
the dual grounds of: (1) equity and (2) the acceptance of public 
responsibility attendant upon participation in the nation's money 
transfer system. 
.If, in the long run, Lhere is to be an integrated, nation-
wide payments mechanism, with participation by all financial 
institutions on an equal footing, then legislation seems indicated. 
I

The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain 
Such legislation presumably would recognize the need for an 
equitable set of ground rules. To the extent that financial 
institutions become more comparable in their activities, to 
that extent they should be expected to meet comparable standards 
and requirements.
