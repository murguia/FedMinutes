Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on July 1, by the Federal Reserve Banks 
°f New York, Minneapolis, and San Francisco on July 3, and by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on July 5, 1968, of the rates on 
discounts and advances in their existing schedules was approved unani-
mously, with the understanding that appropriate advice would be sent 
to those Banks. 
Approved items. The following items were approved unanimously 
after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the Board. Copies are attached under the respective numbers 
indicated.

Letter to Bamerical International Financial

Corporation, San Francisco, California, grant-
ing consent to the acquisition of shares of

Reports on competitive factors. There had been distributed a 
draft of report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed purchase of assets and 
assumption of liabilities of Plantations Bank of Rhode Island, Provi-
dence, Rhode Island, by Old Stone Trust Company, also of Providence. 
During disucssion Governor Maisel suggested that the flavor of 
the analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston of Old Stone Trust 
Company's competitive position be worked into the report. 
There being agreement with the foregoing suggestion, unanimous 
approval was given to the transmittal of the report to the Corporation 
l n
 a form in which the conclusion read as follows: 
The proposed acquisition of Plantations Bank of Rhode 
Island, Providence, by Old Stone Trust Company, Providence, 
a wholly-owned affiliate of Old Stone Savings Bank, Provi-
dence, would eliminate existing competition, particularly 
for mortgage loans and time deposits. Potential competi-
tion in all fields of commercial banking would be elimi-
nated. The transaction would also increase concentration 
of banking resources in the market in a few large banks. 
Although several banking alternatives will remain, the 
overall competitive effect would be adverse.

A report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of The Union 
National Bank of Franklinville, Franklinville, New York, into The 
First Trust Company of Allegany County, Wellsville, New York, was 
approved unanimously for transmittal to the Corporation, the conclu-
sion being stated as follows: 
A small amount of competition exists between The 
Union National Bank of Franklinville and First Trust 
Company of Allegany County, Wellsville, and the com-
petitive effect would be slightly adverse. 
Application of Wachovia Bank and Trust Company (Items 3-5). 
There had been distributed drafts of an order and statement reflecting 
the Board's approval on June 18, 1968, of the application of Wachovia 
Bank and Trust Company, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to merge with 
The State Bank, Laurinburg, North Carolina. A dissenting statement by 
Governors Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer also had been distributed. 
After agreement on certain editorial changes in the majority 
statement, the issuance of the order and statement was authorized. 
Copies of the documents, as issued, are attached as Items 3 and 4. A 
copy of the dissenting statement by Governors Robertson, Maisel, and 
Brimmer is attached as Item No. 5. 
Application of Commerce Bancshares, Inc. There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated June 13, 1968, from the Division of Exami-
nations, with other pertinent papers, regarding the application of 
Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, to become a bank

holding company through acquisition of 80 per cent or more of the 
voting shares of Chariton County Exchange Bank, Brunswick, Citizens 
Bank of Joplin, and The Citizens Bank, Springfield, all in Missouri. 
Following comments by Mr. Lyon based on the material that had 
been distributed, he responded to several questions by members of the 
Board relating generally to the banking structure of the area. 
The application was then approved unanimously, with the under-
standing that an order and statement reflecting this decision would be 
drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Reassignment of territory (Item No. 6). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated July 1, 1968, from the Division of Bank 
Operations recommending approval of the proposal of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Richmond that the portion of South Carolina presently served by 
the head office be reassigned to the territory of the Charlotte Branch. 
Attached to the memorandum, which summarized the arguments in favor of 
the transfer, was a draft of letter to the Federal Reserve Bank reflect-
ing the Division's recommendation. 
Following comments by Mr. Farrell, discussion centered prin-
cipally on questions raised by Governor Mitchell as to whether the 
establishment of a Federal Reserve check-clearing facility in Columbia 
would contribute to greater efficiency of operations. Mr. Farrell 
observed that the question of establishing a branch in Columbia had 
been considered from time to time for a number of years, and he 

iOvJtS^ 
7/8/68 
-6-
reviewed some of the conclusions that had been reached on that score. 
Governor Mitchell then suggested the development of further information 
through the Reserve Bank with regard to the check-clearing center pos-
sibility, but he added that he would be agreeable to concurring in the 
proposed reassignment of territory at this time. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the sending of the pro-
posed letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, with the under-
standing that the information requested by Governor Mitchell would be 
obtained. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 6. 
Testimony on municipal bond rating system. There had been 
distributed a draft of statement to be presented by Governor Sherrill 
on July 10, 1968, in response to a request from Chairman Patman of the 
Joint Economic Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Progress for Board 
testimony on the municipal bond rating system. Also distributed was a 
summary that Governor Sherrill proposed to read at the hearing, when 
he would offer the full statement for the record. 
Following discussion during which several minor suggestions 
were made, it was understood that the statement would be presented in 
a final form satisfactory to Governor Sherrill. 
Salary structure revision (Item No. 7). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum from the Division of Personnel Administration 
dated June 28, 1968, relating to a request by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York for approval of certain changes in the salary structures 

7/8/68 
-7-
applicable to employees at the head office and Buffalo Branch effective 
July 4, 1968, including a special grade 16 maximum of $23,500. Approval 
was recommended by the Division. 
In response to a question by Governor Brimmer, the staff 
explained that the presentation of the matter to the Board had been 
delayed somewhat due to the press of other business. 
In view of the 
circumstances there was general agreement that approval of the struc-
tures on a retroactive basis was in order. 
I 
The revised salary structures were then approved unanimously 
effective July 4, 1968. A copy of the letter sent to the New York 
Bank pursuant to this action is attached as Item No. 7. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: The requirements con-
templated by the Board's action on June 5, 
1968, in approving the issuance of a pre-
liminary permit to Chicago American Inter-
national Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, 
having been completed, a letter was sent 
today to that corporation transmitting a 
final permit to commence business. 
Acting in the absence of Governor Sherrill, 
Mr. Shepardson approved on behalf of the 
Board on July 3, 1968, a memorandum from 
the Division of Personnel Administration 
recommending acceptance of the resignation 
of Sandra J. Miller, Clerk-Typist in that 
Division, effective the close of business 
July 1, 1968.

Item No. II 
7/8/68 
BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY WACHOVIA BANK AND TRUST COMPANY 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH 
THE STATE BANK 
STATEMENT 
Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 
(Wachovia"), with total deposits of $1.2 billion, has applied, pursuant 
t o
 ^ e Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Board's prior approval 
Of L
"e merger of that bank with The State Bank, Laurinburg, North Carolina 
(ns. 
1/ 
e
 Bank"), which has total deposits of $12 million.
-
 
The banks 
Would m 
m
erge under the charter and name of Wachovia, which is a member of 
the 
e
 federal Reserve System, As an incident to the merger, the five 
fices of State Bank would become branches of Wachovia, increasing the 
n
umber of its offices to 111. 
Competition. S tate Bank operates its head office and two 
Q
nches i n Laurinburg (population 8,200), the seat of Scotland County 
^P°Pulation 25,200); the bank also operates a branch at the Laurinburg/ 
industrial park, and a branch in Maxton (population 1,800), 
seven miles east of Laurinburg in Robeson County. State Bank 
l
*ives the preponderance of its business from the area within a 10-mile 
^ius of Laurinburg, which includes most of Scotland County and the 
We
Sterr, 
r n
 portion of Robeson County. Commercial State Bank (total deposits 
are as of December 30, 1967.

$9 million), which is headquartered in Laurinburg, operates four 
offices in this area; the only other banking office in the area is the 
^urinburg branch of Southern National Bank of North Carolina (total 
deposits of $105 million), the State's seventh largest bank. 
State 
Bsnfc holds nearly half of the deposits held by the area's 10 banking 
offices. It does not appear that any offices of other banks would be 
adversely affected by the merger. 
The nearest office of Wachovia to an office of State Bank 
i s
 its branch in Asheboro, 80 miles north of Laurinburg, but Wachovia 
derives a sizable dollar amount of business from a feu large accounts in 
the Laurinburg/lla::ton area. Essentially all of this business, however, 
i s
 beyond the capabilities of State Bank, x;hich has a lending limit of 
$115,000, 
The merger would not eliminate any meaningful competition 
between Wachovia and State Bank, nor would it reduce the number of bank-
1 n 
n
2 alternatives located in the Laurinburg/llaxton area. It would be 
Preferable for Wachovia to enter this area by establishing a de novo 
k^anch, and North Carolina law permits State-wide branching. 
While 
Wachovia did not apply for permission to establish such a branch, entry 
ky this method appears to be only a remote possibility as a practical 
Matter. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks informed the Board by 
l e
tter that he doubted that the State Banking Commission would approve 
t h e
 establishment by Wachovia of a de novo branch in the Laurinburg area, 
l , I
Uch is already served by three banks, and that his office certainly 
*
7
°uld not recommend approval.

Uachovia, with about 22 per cent of total commercial ban!: 
^posits in the State, is the largest bank in North Carolina; the largest 
Percentage of deposits ever held by Wachovia was 24.1 per cent, which it 
as of December 31, 1961. The acquisition of State Bank would increase 
Wachovia
1
s share of the State's total commercial bank deposits by about 
two-tenths of one per cent.- The five largest banks in North Carolina hold 
67 per cent of the State's commercial bank deposits, which is a high 
degree of concentration in terms of State-wide aggregates. However, the 
Proposed merger would enable Uachovia to establish offices in a county 
located near the center of a group of 17 counties in which it presently has 
n o
 offices. 
The effect of the merger on competition would not be 
significantly adverse. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. The banking 
Actors with respect to each of the banks proposing to merge are satis-
factory, as they would be with reepcct to the resulting bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities.. The only significant 
e
££ect of the merger on banking convenience and needs would be in the area 
Presently served by State Bank. 
In recent years, the economy of the Laurinburg/llaxton area has 
b
een undergoing a transition from agricultural to manufacturing activities. 
Since 1960, eight plants have established operations in Scotland County; 
t h e
 principal firms employ well over 3,000 persons and, in the last four 
years, the county's industrial payroll has increased by 62 per cent. The 
l a
urinburg/lIaxton industrial park, containing some 2,000 acres, is designed 
t o
 attract new industry. Uachovia has been a facto-- directly, and indirectly 

o <r% 
/ C O 
-2-
through participations, in financing the larger concerns in this area 
whose needs are beyond the capacity of an institution the size of State 
Bank with its low lending limit. 
Wachovia has extended commercial credit in Laurinburg in 
founts approximating $2 million on the average, almost double the amount 
0j
- deposits it derives from businesses and individuals in the area. 
In 
addition it has extended substantial amounts of instalment credit in 
^urinburg, having about $050,000 in such loans outstanding as of 
°
e
Ptember 1967. Thus, Wachovia's contribution to the area's banking 
n e
eds would not only be a competently blended range of banking services 
m
 
a large 
lending limit, but also the access to credit resources 
b e
yond those generated locally. 
The replacement of State Bank by offices of Wachovia would 
facilitate the economic growth of the Laurinburg/llaxton area by affording 
convenient alternative source of credit for medium-sized business con-
e r
n s , which are to a great extent dependent upon local sources for bank-
i n
2 services. 
Summary and conclusions. 
In the judgment of the Board, the 
Proposed merger would benefit the banking convenience and needs of the 
Q u
rinburg/Maxton area, and would not result in any significantly adverse 
c
°nsequences for banking competition. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the application should be 
a
Pproved. 
J u l
y U , 1968. 

/ O O 
Item No. 5 
7/8/68 
DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNORS ROBERTSON, MAISEL AND BRIMMER 
In our judgment, the majority, by approving the application 
i n
 this case, gives its sanction to exactly the kind of transaction 
the Bank Merger Act was designed to preclude. 
State Bank is one of only two banks headquartered in Scotland 
County and it is one of only three banks operating offices in the 
L a u r
inburg/Maxton market area. It operates 5 of the 10 banking offices 
s
ituated in this area and accounts for nearly half of the total deposits 
held by these 10 offices. State Bank has been a growing institution. 
l t s
 deposits increased from $7 million in 1959 to $12 million in 1967; 
d u
ring the 18-month period from June 1966 to December 1967, the bank's 
deposits rose by 20 per cent. This deposit growth has been accompanied 
b
y an upward trend in earnings. State Bank, which is located in an 
a * . . 
a
 °f considerable industrial potential, would have very good prospects 
continued growth, but for the majority's order authorizing its 
e
*tinction. 
In arriving at the conclusion that the acquisition of State 
Bank by Wachovia would not have a significantly adverse effect on 
competition the majority, we believe, fails to include all of the 
r e
levant considerations under the competitive factor. Although State 
does not presently compete for the large deposit and loan accounts 
hat Wachovia derives from the Laurinburg/Maxton market, State Bank 
°
u
ld become a competitor for much of this business. This could occur, 

2 6 ( 3 2 
- 2 -
either through the internal growth of State Bank, or through its merger 
w i t
h a larger bank operating in a separate market, but with other than 
°ne of the State's largest banking institutions. In addition, the 
development of competition between Wachovia and State Bank through 
the establishment by Wachovia of a de novo branch in the Laurinburg/ 
Maxton market should not be ruled out on the ground that the North 
Carolina Banking Commission would probably deny an application for 
authority to establish such a branch. This is especially true where, 
a s
 here, Wachovia didn't even bother to file an application. 
The 
effectiveness of the Bank Merger Act should not be blunted by capitu-
l a
tion to the anticompetitive policies of State authorities; the State 
Policies may well be changed, particularly if they are not reinforced 
b y 
t h e
 actions of Federal authorities. 
Moreover, the acquisition of State Bank by Wachovia ought 
t o
 he regarded as seriously anticompetitive even if the statute law 
°f North Carolina flatly prohibited dje novo branching. The question 
o f
 whether there is existing or potential competition between these 
bank* 4 
is not the only — or even the most important — consideration in 
a s
sessing the consequences of the merger for competition. The replace-
m G t l t o f
 viable banks such as State Bank by offices of the State's 
gest banking institutions reduces the likelihood of market entry by 
n
ewiy chartered banks. And, to allow the few largest banks to become, 
^
r
°ugh mergers, the only (or the principal) alternatives in every 
s i
8nificant local banking market in the State -- which is plainly the 

(OOlfO 
-2-
trend in North Carolina — 
is simply to allow them to enlarge the 
geographical sphere of their dominance."^ 
If this trend is not halted, 
the barriers to market entry will become virtually complete and con-
sumers of banking services, except the very largest, in whatever 
direction they turn, will have to deal with one of a mere handful of 
banks. The Bank Merger Act and the antitrust laws were designed to 
Prevent just this kind of situation from developing — 
to halt it in 
its incipiency. 
Wachovia has averaged one merger per year for the past 13 
years, acquiring in the process loans in excess of $82 million and 
d e
Posits in excess of $178 million. These loans and deposits represent 
a
Pproximately 12 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, of Wachovia
1
s 
l o
ans and deposits as of June 30, 1967. During this period of 13 years, 
Wachovia and the next four largest banks in North Carolina together 
a c
quired 59 banks by merger, along with more than $454 million in loans 
21 
and over $835 million in d e p o s i t s T h e s e loans and deposits represent 
m
°re than 21 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, of the loans and 
d e
Posits held by these five banks as of June 30, 1967. For North 
c
a r o l i n a National Bank, the State's second largest bank, these loans 
a n d
 deposits represent approximately 36 per cent and 38 per cent, 
r e
spectively, of the loans and deposits it held on June 30, 1967; for 
•J7-— 
Y First Union National Bank of North Carolina, the State's third 
a r
gest bank, recently filed an application to acquire the sole remain-
8 bank headquartered in Scotland County. 
Loan and deposit figures are adjusted to reflect a total of three 
^
G r
g e r s effected after June 30, 1967, by the second and third largest 
°anks i n t h e state. 

f * 
' A 
-2-
F
irst Union National Bank of North Carolina, the State's third largest 
bank, these loans and deposits represent approximately 34 per cent and 
3 9
 per cent, respectively, of the loans and deposits it held on 
J u n e 
3 0
> 1967. The successful merger activities of these banks, which 
a r e
 ^ c h o v i a
1
s two largest competitors, have, without doubt, influenced 
Wachovia to seek additional banks through merger; and the majority's 
approval of the merger of Wachovia and State Bank will, no doubt, 
influence Wachovia's large competitors to seek still more banks through 
merger. 
It is no answer to say, as does the majority, that although 
Wachovia, with about 22 per cent of total commercial bank deposits in 
e
 State, is the largest bank in North Carolina, the largest percentage 
deposits Wachovia ever held was 24.1 per cent, which was in 1961. 
°
Ur
 duty under the law is not to facilitate the reversal of a trend 
t Q
Ward the deconcentration of banking resources, if any there be, but 
t o
 Reserve the possibility of further deconcentration. In point of 
f a c t
, however, the five largest banks in North Carolina held 67 per 
C e
nt of the State's commercial bank deposits, as of June 30, 1967, 
whereas they held 42,4 per cent of these deposits ten years earlier; 
s
 is by far the largest increase in the percentage of deposits held 
^ring this period experienced by the five largest banking organizations 
i n
 any State in the Union. There are only 11 States in which the 
c
°ncentration 
of banking resources in the top five banking organiza-
t
ions i s greater than in North Carolina; there were slight decreases 

°G(>5 
-2-
concentration ratios in seven of these States during the decade 
ended June 30, 1967, 
The majority bases its approval of the application in this 
C a s e
 on the ground that State Bank has been unable to meet the larger 
credit needs of its customers, and asserts that the merger ", , , 
would facilitate the economic growth of the Laurinburg/Haxton area 
b y
 affording a convenient alternative source of credit for medium-
sized business concerns, which are to a great extent dependent upon 
local sources for banking services." 
During 1967, State Bank originated 
loans portions of which were placed with other banks. 
The 
l
aurinburg/liaxton area is served by an office of the State s seventh 
largest bank, which has total deposits in excess of $100 million; and, 
course, the area is served by Wachovia, particularly the area's 
larger credit needs. Further, as we indicated earlier, the estab-
lishment by Wachovia of a de novo branch in the Laurinburg/llaxton area 
should not be ruled out; nor should the merger of State Bank with a 
*
G r
ger bank, but with other than one of the State's giants. In short, 
i £ 
there is any evidence in the record of this case supporting the 
c
°nclu8ion 
that the banking needs of the Laurinburg/ilaxton area are 
n
°t being -- or will not be -- adequately and conveniently met, we are 
U n a b
l e to find it -- and certainly, the majority has not adduced any. 
T a u s
, even if the probable competitive consequences of the merger could 
b e
 Properly denominated as "not significantly adverse" (and we think 
t h e
 effect on competition will be substantially adverse), there is 

o 
M 
- 6 -
n
othing under the convenience and needs factor to warrant approval. 
.J, -
In 
sum, we think it is quite clear that the continued 
elimination of sound, independent banks, such as State Bank, through 
merger with the dominant banks in North Carolina is inimical to the 
Preservation of healthy banking competition in the State. 
Indeed, 
• j 
if the majority's rationale for approving this application is followed, 
result will be a banking structure in which a few giant banks 
blanket the whole of North Carolina, a result that is directly at odds 
w i t
h the very purpose of the Bank Merger Act.
