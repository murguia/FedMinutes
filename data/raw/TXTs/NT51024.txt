FEDERAL. RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON. 0. C. 20551 
February 13, 1973 
1'hc Honorable Wright Patman 
Chairman 
Committee on Banking and Currency 
House of Representatives 
Washington, D. C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
X am writing in further response to your letter oi January 4 inquiring 
about plans of the Federal Reserve Banks for the construction of branch 
bank buildings and about the status of costs of the Federal Reserve 
Board's annex building in Washington, 
As you know, the statutory limit contained in Sec. 10 of the Federal 
Reserve Act applies to the cost of the building proper, exclusive of 
the cost of land acquisition, vaults, permanent equipment, furnishings, 
ar>d fixtures. 
The enclosed table (Attachment I) shows the location, 
cost and completion date for each of the existing Banks and branches, 
There is an urgent need for expanded facilities and improved security 
Protection at a number of branches. 
In order to correct the deficien-
cies, several building programs have already been authorized. An 
addition c.urrertly under construction to the Pittsburgh branch will 
Require expenditure of $530,000 in building proper funds. The Board 
Governors ban authorized this expenditure, utilizing a portion of 
the balance under the present limitation. Replacement of the present 
Helena Branch facility by a new building will cost approximately 
$2,400,000 in building proper funds. Also, a proposed addition to the 
Present Detroit Branch building is contemplated at ar estimated expendi 
ture of $5,100,000 building proper funds. Completion of these three 
Projects will reduce the balance allowed for branch expenditures under 
the 1962 authorization to approximately $52,000. 
light of this situation, we have prepared an estimate of the build~ 
iug proper funds we anticipate viJ.be needed over the next five years, 
along with the projects to which they apply. These figures, -which 
total just over £73 million, appear in the accompanying table (Attach-
ment II). 
^r-ffriifVyp 
*. '>A :. J-1-' 
S'hese figures represent the Br arc's best estimate of outmost pressing 
tteeds v Since the submittal to Congress a year ago of estimates for 

The Honorable Wright Patman 
-2-
expend5.tares relating to branch bank building programs, the Board 
authorized the staff to carefully reexamine the programs in the light 
of the significant .improvements in operating procedures and organiza-
tion that have been adopted to make certain that the proposed programs 
are essential to carry out the System's responsibilities. 
The figures 
X am submitting today reflect this reexamination. 
However, the 
staff's analysis will continue, to assure that each dollar spent in 
the branch bank building programs will provide the. maximum public 
benefits obtainable. 
1 should like to emphasize the important work which the branches of 
Federal Reserve Banks perform, both for the banking system and the 
convenience of the public, including especially the handling of checks, 
currency and coin. The use of branches by the Reserve Banks saves 
time and money in transporting cash and checks, in addition to facili-
tating efficient banking operations. As the economy grows, the work-
load of the Federal Reserve Banks and branches also expands. 
While 
technological improvements in "he method of handling ma ay Federal 
Reserve operations have helped reduce our need for additional space, 
increases in the volume of operations have been so great as to more 
than offset the space savings obtained from technological advances, 
for example, in the dr.cade 1961-1971, check colJectionr increased 
106 percent, coin operations 90 percent, and current operations 56 
percent , 
With regard to the Federal Reserve's annex building in Washington, 
the estimated cost at the time construction was authorized in November 
1970 was $39,400,000. 
This was reported on page 212 of the Board's 
Annual Report for 1970. 
The estimate is for a total building area of 
807,825 square feet, leading to an original estimated cost per square 
toot of $48.77. 
Since the release of the original cost estimate, the Board has 
authorized changes in the building, intended to add to the building's 
present design capacity up to 300 more persons. 
These changes will 
Cost approximately $1,900,000, bringing the current estimated cost of 
the building to $41,300,000. 
The revised estimated cost per square 
foot cf the annex building thus is $51.12. 
Sincerely yours, 
Arthur F, Burns

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FIRST VIRGINIA BANKSHARES CORPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Benson Investment Corporation 
First Virginia Bankshares Corporation, Falls Church, 
Virginia, a bank holding company within the meaning of the 
Sank Holding Company Act, has applied for the Board's approval, 
under section 4(c)(8) of the Act and § 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's 
Regulation Y, to acquire all of the voting shares of the successor 
bV merger to Benson Investment Corporation, Birmingham, Alabama 
("Benson"), a company that engages in the activities of a finance 
company and acts as an agent with respect to sales of credit 
life and disability insurance on borrowers in connection with 
its loans, and casualty insurance on property securing such 
loans. Such activities have been determined by the Board to 
be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks 
(12 CFR 225.4(a)(1) and (9)). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views on the public 
interest factors, has been duly published (37 Federal Register 
23294). The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
atl(J the Board has considered all comments received, including 
those of an Alabama insurance agency and a Georgia bank, in 
light of the public interest factors set forth in section 
4(<0(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). 

_ 170 
-2-
Applicant controls 21 banks in Virginia with aggregate 
deposits of $643.4 million, comprising 6.6 per cent of the State's 
t(>tal commercial bank depositsM Benson is a consumer and com-
mercial finance company operating 24 offices in Alabama, Florida, 
Louisiana, Georgia, and South Carolina with total assets of $6.0 
Million. Each of Applicant^ subsidiary banks engages in the 
^king of small loans to individuals. However, none of those banks 
operate in geographic areas served by Benson. Conversely, Benson 
does riot operate in areas served by subsidiaries of Applicant. 
Therefore, it appears that consummation of the proposal would not 
eliminate any existing competition between Applicant and Benson. 
adverse competitive effects would appear to result from 
Removal of Applicant or Benson as a potential competitor of the 
other because neither is considered a likely de novo entrant 
into the other's markets, and there are several other potential 
eotnpetitors in the product and geographic markets that both 
serve. 
During the course of its consideration of this applica-
tion, the Board has received, from an Alabama insurance agency 
atld
 Q Georgia bank, adverse comments on the application. Both 
Question the need for the proposed acquisition and suggest that 
applicant may resort to the use of "coercive tactics aimed at 
*ts borrowers" to promote its insurance sales. However, 
Respective of Board action on this application, Benson will

engage in the sale of credit-related insurance as it has in 
the past. Applicant has indicated that a borrower from Benson 
is, and will continue to be, free to secure insurance c o v ^ g e 
frnm any insurance agent, 
The Georgia bank further contends that consummation 
the proposed transaction would result in an undue concentration 
resources and suggests that Applicant may attempt to acquire 
* bank located in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, 
0 r Florida. However, Benson ie a relatively small finance com-
and its largest market share in any of the markets in which 
it: competes is less than 10 per cent. That market is approximated 
by the city of Montgomery, Alabama, where it is the second largest 
fina nee company, based on total loans outstanding, competes with 
°ther national and Statewide finance companies and may not be 
characterized as dominant. Applicant is the sixth largest bank 
h°lding company in Virginia. But for a small office in Orlando, 
Florida,'-f Applicant neither operates nor is generally known in 
the States in which Benson operates. Consummation of the proposed 
transaction will not, in the Board's judgment, result in an undue 
concentration of resources in any section of the country. The 
Su8gestion that Applicant may eventually acquire a bank located 
2/^Benson operates its only Florida office in Jacksonville, Florida, 
where, it is estimated it has a market share of 2.7 per cent and 
competes with several offices of the nation's major consumer^finance 
companies. The geographic markets of Applicant's and Benson s 
Florida offices do not overlap. 

< <<-/ 
-4-
°utside of Virginia is unfounded in that such an acquisition 
3 / 
in effect, be prohibited, by section 3(d) of the Act.-
The Georgia Bank also contends that, upon the 
^filiation of Benson with Applicant, Benson*s offices would 
constitute branch offices of Applicant's lead bank in violation 
o f Georgia law. The Board has repeatedly stated that a State's 
restrictive branch banking laws are not automatically applicable 
t o bank holding company operations, and the Board, in this case, 
hQs found, based upon the facts of record, that Benson will not 
b e operated in such a manner that it and any banking subsidiary 
o f Applicant could be characterized as being engaged in unitary 
derations. The Board, therefore, concludes that the offices 
o f Benson will not constitute branch offices of any banking 
subsidiary of Applicant. 
Finally, it is contended that no public benefits 
flow from consummation of the proposed transaction. The 
s°ard disagrees. Applicant's advantage over Benson in issuing 
V Section 3(d) provides, in pertinent part: 
. . .no application shall be approved under this 
section which will permit any bank holding com-
pany or any subsidiary thereof to acquire, directly, 
or indirectly, any voting shares of, interest in, 
or all or substantially all of the assets of any 
additional bank located outside the State in 
which the operations of such bank holding company's 
banking subsidiaries were principally conducted 
on the effective date of this amendment [December 31, 
1970]. . . . 

473

commercial paper and longer-term debentures may increase resources 
available to Benson, thereby permitting expansion of Benson's 
loan volume and geographic scope of operations. Such expansion 
would increase competition and public convenience. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations 
reflacted in the record, the Board has determined that the 
balance of the public interest factors the Board is required 
to consider under section 4(c)(8) is favorable. Accordingly, 
the application is hereby approved. This determination is 
subject to the conditions set forth in section 225.4(c) of 
Regulation Y and to the Board's authority to require such 
modification or termination of the activities of a holding 
company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary 
to assure compliance with the provisions and purposes of the 
Act and the Board1s regulations and orders issued thereunder, 
to prevent evasion thereof.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FLORIDA NATIONAL BANKS OF FLORIDA, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Florida National Banks of Florida, Inc., Jacksonville, 
Florida, a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank 
Holding Company Act, has applied for the Board's approval under 
§ 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 90 per 
cent or more of the voting shares of Bank of Commerce of Florida, 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida ("Fort Lauderdale Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given 
in accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing com-
ments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the 
application and all comments received in light of the factors 
set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls 31 banks with aggregate deposits of 
approximately $1 billion, representing 5.9 per cent of deposits in 
commercial banks in Florida, and is the third largest banking 
organization and multibank holding company in the State. (All 
banking data are as of June 30, 1972, and reflect holding com-
pany formations and acquisitions approved through December 31, 1972.) 
The acquisition of Fort Lauderdale Bank (deposits of $18.8 million) 
would Increase Applicant's share of State deposits by .1 percentage 
Point. 

475 
t 2 -
Fort Lauderdale Bank serves the North Broward County banking 
market controlling 1.37 per cent of the market's total deposits as 
the twenty-third largest of the 40 banks. The three largest of the bank 
holding companies competing in this market hold collectively more 
than 50 per cent of the market's total deposits, with respective 
holdings of 20.5 per cent, 19.3 per cent, and 10.5 per cent. It 
appears that affiliation of Fort Lauderdale Bank with Applicant 
would increase its ability to compete with the larger banks without 
adversely affecting any of the area banks. 
Applicant's nearest subsidiary to bank is located 25 miles 
to the south and does not compete with Fort Lauderdale Bank. The 
acquisition of subject bank would represent Applicant's initial 
entry into the North Broward County banking market. No meaningful 
present competition would be eliminated by consummation of this 
Proposal, and in view of the distances separating the banking 
offices and State laws restricting branching, it appears unlikely 
that any significant competition would develop. It is the Board's 
opinion that the proposal would have no adverse effects on exist-
ing or potential competition, and would not tend to create a monopoly 
or" in .anjj rtajjner be in je.straint of trade in . the relevant area. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of 
Applicant, its present subsidiaries, and of Fort Lauderdale Bank 
are generally satisfactory and the prospects for each appear 
favorable. 
Considerations relating to banking factors are con-
sistent with approval of the application. There are no primary 

476 
-3-
banking needs of the area which are not served at the present time. 
However, Applicant proposes to assist Fort Lauderdale Bank in more 
aggressive marketing of its deposit and loan services, to expand its 
trust services, improve present computer services, and to supply the 
bank with specialized management and consultants. 
Considerations 
delating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be 
served are consistent with and lend some support toward approval 
of the application. 
It is the Board's judgment that consummation 
of the proposed transaction would be in the public interest and 
that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
for the reasons summarized above. 
The transaction shall not be 
consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the 
effective date of this Order or (b) later than three months after 
the effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended 
for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
FIRST UNION, INCORPORATED 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
First Union, Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri, a bank holding 
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
fo* the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) 
t o acquire 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of Citizens Bank of 
Pacific, Pacific, Missouri ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(h) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
n o n e has been timely received. The Board has considered the application 
l n iight of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant, the third largest bank holding company in Missouri, 
c°ntrols 12 banks with aggregate deposits of $991.9 million, representing 
per cent of total deposits of commercial banks in the State. (All 
anking data are as of June 30, 1972, and reflect holding company formations 
atld acquisitions approved through December 31, 1972.) 
Consummation of the proposed acquisition of Bank ($11.4 million 
of deposits) would increase Applicant's share of deposits of commercial 
banks i n th e state by only .1 percentage points and would not significantly 
in 
Crease concentration of bank resources in Missouri. 
Bank, the only bank located in the city of Pacific, is the 
f o 
Urth largest of five< banks competing in the Pacific banking market 
^;hich includes areas adjacent to Pacific) and controls 15 
per cent of 

478 
-2-
^arket area deposits. The three larger banks in this market each controls 
®°re than 25 per cent of area deposits. Bank is located approximately 40 
^iles southwest of downtown St. Louis, Missouri, in which Applicant's 
lead bank (First National Bank in St. Louis, $795 million of deposits) is 
located. It appears that no significant competition exists between Bank 
and Applicant's lead bank or any of Applicant's other subsidiary banks. 
In view of Bank's small size, the presence of a large number of intervening 
banks and Missouri's restrictive branching laws, it appears unlikely that 
a*y meaningful competition would develop among Bank and any of Applicant's 
Present subsidiary banks. The prospect of Applicant entering Bank's market 
5®. novo is unlikely in view of the relatively low population density in Bank's 
Market. 
On the record before it, the Board concludes that consummation 
o f Applicant's proposal would not result in a monopoly nor be in furtherance 
o f any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business of 
banking, nor have any significant anticompetitive effect, in any area of 
the State. 
The financial condition and managerial resources of Applicant and 
its subsidiaries appear generally satisfactory and future prospects of all 
seem favorable. The financial condition of Bank is satisfactory and its 
future prospects appear favorable. Affiliation with Applicant should provide 
Bank with an adequate source of qualified managerial and technical 
resources to enable Eank to offer expanded and more efficient banking 
services. It appears that most of the banking needs of the residents 

479 
-3-
Bank's market are being met by Bank and other banks in its market. 
Applicant has expressed its intention to provide a number of specialized 
services through Bank such as trust, data processing, and automatic 
teller services. Provision of these and other services should provide 
benefits to residents of Bank's market. These factors, as they relate 
to the convenience and needs of the community to be served, lend some 
Weight for approval of the application. It is the Eoard's judgment that 
consummation of the proposed acquisition is in the public interest and 
that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) 
before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 
this Order, or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board 
° r by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
OAKLAND BANSHARES, INC. 
Order Approving Formation of Bank Holding Company and 
Retention of Spencer Insurance Agency 
Oakland Banshares, Inc., Oakland, Iowa, has applied for the 
Board's approval under § 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 
U.s.c. 1842(a)(1)) of formation of a bank holding company through 
acquisition of 95.45 per cent or more of the voting shares of Oakland 
Savings Bank, Oakland, Iowa ("Bank"). 
At the same time, Applicant has submitted its application for 
the Board's approval under § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) 
and § 225.4(b)(2) of the Board's Regulation Y to engage in certain 
Permissible insurance agency activities through the retention of assets 
°f Spencer Insurance Agency, Oakland, Iowa ("Agency"). 
Notice of the receipt of these applications, affording oppor-
tunity for interested persons to submit comments and views, has been 
given in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of the Act. The time for filing 
comments and views has expired, and the Board has considered the applica-
tions and all comments received in light of the factors set forth in 
§ 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)), and the considerations specified 
in § 4(c)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). 
Applicant's sole business activity is operating Agency. 
Bank 
($6.0 million in deposits) is the smaller of two banks in Oakland, a 
community of approximately 1,350 people, and ranks seventh among ten 
banks in Pottawattamie County, the relevant banking market, with 3.3 per 

481 
1/ 
cent of total deposits in the markets 
Since the transaction involves 
only a change from individual to corporate ownership, consummation of the 
Proposal will have no adverse effects on existing or potential competition. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
of Applicant and its existing subsidiary are consistent with approval. 
Applicant proposes to make Bank a more aggressive competitor by increasing 
its loans to local industry and businesses, by expanding installment 
lending, and by improving Bank's parking and drive-in facilities. Accord-
ingly, considerations relating to the convenience and needs of the 
community to be served, with respect to the acquisition of Bank, lend 
height toward approval. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of 
the transaction would be in the public interest and that the application 
to acquire Bank should be approved. 
Agency is a general insurance agency located on the premises of 
Bank* The operation by a bank holding company of a general insurance 
agency in a community of less than 5,000 people is an activity that the 
Board has previously determined by regulation to be closely related to 
hanking (12 CFR 225.4(a)(9)(iii)(a)). 
There is no evidence in the record indicating that consummation 
of the proposal would result in any undue concentration of resources, 
unfair competition, conflicts of interests, unsound banking practices, or 
other adverse effects on the public interest. The continued operation of 
X/ AlT banking data are as of June 30, 1972. 

Agency by Applicant would assure the continuation of a source of general 
insurance in Oakland. Based upon the foregoing and other considerations 
reflected in the record, the Board has determined that the balance of the 
Public interest factors the Board is required to consider regarding the 
retention of Agency under § 4(c)(8) is favorable and that the application 
sbould be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the applications to acquire Bank 
and to continue to engage in insurance agency activities are approved for 
fche reasons summarized above. The acquisition of Bank shall not be con-
summated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective 
date of this Order or (b) later than three months after the effective date 
°f this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pursuant to delegated authority. 
The determination as to Agency's activities is subject to the Board's 
authority to require reports by, and make examinations of, holding corn-
Panics and their subsidiaries and to require such modification or termi-
nation of the activities of a holding company or any of its subsidiaries 
as the Board finds necessary to assure compliance with the provisions and 
Purposes of the Act arid the Board's regulations and orders issued there-
under, or to prevent evasion thereof,
