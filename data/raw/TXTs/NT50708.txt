December 16, 1970 

Minutes of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System on Wednesday, December 16, 1970. The Board met in the Board 
Room at 10:00 a.m. 
PRESENT: Mr. Burns, Chairman 1/ 
Mr. Robertson, Vice Chairman 
Mr. Mitchell 
Mr. Daane 
Mr. Brimmer 
Mr. Sherrill 
Mr. Kenyon, Deputy Secretary 
Mr. Kakalec, Controller 
As requested at yesterday's budget review meeting, the Controller 
had submitted tables outlining for the Board's consideration a means of 
deducing the proposed 1971 Board capability Budget from $24,164,000 to 
$23,119,100 and showing the amounts that would be involved in establishing 
an adjusted program in place budget. Copies of the tables are attached 
as Items 1 and 2. 
At the Chairman's invitation, Governor Sherrill reviewed the 
table in which possible reductions of the capability budget were presented. 
Chairman Burns then noted that the budget for 1970 had represented 
an increase of approximately 25 per cent and that even the reduced capa-
bility budget would involve another significant increase. He raised 
questions about the prospect for the next several years, noted the parti-
cular responsibility that rested upon the Board in the absence of 
17 Attended parts of the meeting during the day.

Congressional control over the Board's budget, and discussed the 
possibility that challenges to the independence of the Federal Reserve 
might develop if sharp budget increases continued over a period of time. 
Governor Mitchell suggested that the problem be considered in 
the perspective of the Federal Reserve System as a whole. He referred 
to various items of expenditure, including certain Culpeper operations, 
that might be transferred to the Federal Reserve Banks, thus relieving 
the Board's budget to that extent. 
There followed a discussion of the trend in Reserve Bank budgets 
during which Governor Sherrill mentioned possibilities for economy 
inherent in the further automation of various Bank operations. He pointed 
out, however, that there had been some tendency in recent years to feel 
that the Board should play a role of greater leadership in System matters 
and that the exercising of such a role contributed to an increase in 
Board costs. He also pointed out that although automation would eventually 
Pay dividends in terms of obtaining production at decreasing cost, substan-
tial expenses were involved in developing automated programs and putting 
them in motion. 
Governor Sherrill added that an estimate as to the trend of 
Board expenditures in the future would depend to a certain extent on 
the Board's judgment with respect to centralizing further. At best, he 
foresaw annual increases in the cost of Board operations in the neighbor-
hood of 10 per cent a year.

Governor Robertson referred to the increases in expenses that 
were attributable to the assignment of additional functions to the Board 
under the provisions of new legislation, and to general pay increases. 
In his view, the Board was vulnerable to attack principally if it failed 
to do everything within its power to maximize the efficiency of its 
staff in conducting its operations. When the Board did a job, it should 
do that job well, but it should be sure that all money spent, including 
money spent on little things, could be justified. 
Governor Robertson went on to comment on the degree of respon-
sibility that he felt should be placed in the Board member in charge of 
internal administrative affairs to insure efficiency of operations. In 
his opinion, perhaps the only questions that really needed to come before 
the Board were those involving expenditures in connection with newly 
assigned Board functions or proposals for the assumption of new respon-
sibilities by some division of the staff. 
Chairman Burns indicated that he agreed for the most part, but 
he expressed the view that the Board should devote sufficient time to 
budget review and related matters to protect the Board member in charge 
°f internal administrative affairs from the possibility of unjustified 
criticism. Governor Brimmer noted that the delegation of administrative 
responsibility to the Chairman, and through him to Governor Sherrill, in 
February 1970 did not extend to approval of the Board's budget. Governor 
Robertson then commented that his suggestion was not intended to foreclose 

3157

Governor Sherrill from coming to the Board for advice to such 
extent as he felt necessary. 
Governor Sherrill commented that intelligent exercise of 
authority to the extent that had been suggested necessitated knowing the 
organization in detail and costing its functions. Steps toward making 
such knowledge better available were in process through the program 
planning and budgeting system, but the work had not yet been completed. 
Governor Sherrill went on to say that he had already ordered, 
on his own authority, certain cuts in the division budgets as initially 
formulated, that further reductions would in his judgment impair the 
work of the organization to some degree, that the table compiled by the 
Controller had indicated what might be involved in a cut of approximately 
$1 million in the proposed 1971 capability budget, and that in his 
judgment additional cuts of any significance could affect the organiza-
tion severely. He could not recommend any further cut, although he 
would of course administer to the best of his ability whatever decision 
wight be reached by the Board. In reply to a question whether he would 
recommend a $1 million cut, he said that it must be considered by the 
Chairman.

There followed discussion of the items that would be eliminated, 
according to the Controller's table, to accomplish a budget reduction of

$1 million, after which the Chairman asked whether it was the view of 
the Board members that the Board should try to effect a saving of $1 
million. Several members expressed the view that such an effort should 
be made. The Chairman noted that alternative possibilities for reduc-
tions might become apparent in the course of meeting with the heads of 
divisions today. He suggested that after those discussions the Board 
turn the matter over to Governor Sherrill with instruction to cut the 
proposed capability budget of $24.1 million by $1 million in his 
discretion.

Governor Sherrill noted that one possibility would be to slow 
down on recruiting for vacant positions as a partial offset to the effect 
°f the general pay increase that appeared imminent. 
The Board then met with the Director of the Division of 
Research and Statistics and the latter's aides to discuss the proposed 
budget of that Division. After a luncheon recess, the Board met with 
the Director of the Division of Data Processing and other officers from 
that Division. 
Subsequently, the Board discussed the question of eliminating 
from the budget funds that had been provided to maintain a computer 
capability 
at the Culpeper facility. It was the conclusion that a 
further study should be made of the requirements at that location from 
a System standpoint and that negotiations should then be undertaken with

the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond with a view to having the expense 
of providing for those requirements borne by that Bank or allocated to 
the several Reserve Banks. It was estimated that by this means a 
reduction of approximately $550,000 in the Board's budget could be 
effected. 
The Board also discussed further the other possible cuts in 
the budget that had been listed in the Controller's memorandum. With 
regard to the book "The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions," 
it was the view that there should be no further printing of the present 
edition and that work should go forward on a new edition. 
The Board then met sequentially with the Directors and other 
officers of the Division of International Finance and the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation. Certain modest cuts that might be made in 
the budgets of those divisions were generally agreed upon, subject to 
further discussion by the divisions with Governor Sherrill. 
Thereafter, the Board continued its meeting with only Messrs. 
Kenyon and Kakalec of the staff present. 
A proposal was made by Governor Robertson (Chairman Burns was 
n°t present) that the Board approve a 1971 capability budget of $24,164,000, 
as originally proposed, less approximately $1,000,000, and leave it to 
Governor Sherrill to determine in his discretion, on the basis of today's 
discussion and other considerations, how the cut might most appropriately 
be effected.

There was agreement with Governor Robertson's proposal, and 
the 1971 budget was approved on that basis. (Note: Attached as 
Item No. 3 is a copy of a table reflecting the adjusted budget.) In 
this connection, the Board also authorized an assessment upon the 
Reserve Banks to cover the Board's estimated expenditures for the first 
half of 1971 based on the action taken by the Board on the budget. 
(Note: The assessment rate was subsequently established as .828 of one 
per cent of the total paid-in capital and surplus of each Bank as of 
December 31, 1970.) 
The meeting then adjourned.
