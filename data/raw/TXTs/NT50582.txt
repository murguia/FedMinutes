Gold loan. 
In a memorandum dated February 19, 1970, the Division 
of International Finance discussed a proposed $40 million gold collateral 
loan (or loans) to the Central Bank of the Philippines for a period of

-2-
three months. 
The loan would be secured by gold held in the vaults of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as agent and would carry the 
usual terms and conditions. 
The loan had been authorized yesterday by 
the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York subject to approval 
of the Board of Governors, and the staff recommended such approval. 
Consideration of the proposed loan led to a more general discus-
sion of Federal Reserve gold loan policy. 
In view of questions raised, 
it was agreed that the staff would reexamine the subject and report 
back to the Board on whether continued existence of the gold loan facility 
was believed to be justified and, if so, the conditions that should 
attach to its use. 
The proposed loan to the Central Bank of the Philippines was then 
approved unanimously with the understanding that the New York Bank, in 
advising the Central Bank of approval of the loan, would indicate that 
renewal would be considered only if satisfactory progress was being made 
on the country's economic stabilization program. A copy of the telegram 
sent to the New York Bank is attached as Item No. I. 
Academic consultants. 
Governor Daane commented briefly, in 
supplementation of a memorandum from Governor Maisel previously distrib-
uted, on the February 18 meeting of the Treasury's academic consultants. 
The meeting then adjourned.
