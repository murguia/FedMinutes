MEMBER OF THE BOAPC! 
September 8, 1967. 
The Honorable Dante B. Fascell, Chairman, 
Subcommittee on Legal and Monetary Affairs 
of the Committee on Government Operations, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
During the year and a half that has elapsed since I appeared 
before your Subcommittee in February of 1966 to discuss Federal 
Reserve float, there have been several developments in which you may 
be interested. 
Subsequent to that appearance and following a period of 
Planning and preparation, the System conducted, for the entire month 
°f September 1966, the most comprehensive float survey we had ever 
attempted. 
The results quantified the major sources of float, 
^-dentified practices giving rise to float, and also suggested some 
Possibilities for further action to reduce float. 
September is a seasonally neutral month so far as float is 
concerned and in September 1966 there were no significant disruptions 
^ue to weather, strikes, or equipment difficulties. Under these con-
ditions, time schedule float turned out to account for over half of 
the total; remittance, transportation, and hold-over components showed 
up 
in about equal proportions to make up the remainder as indicated 
the following table:

Following this analytical survey several steps were taken 
to reduce the level of float. The most significant measure was the 
adoption of a uniform policy, effective February 17, 1967, under 
which no Federal Reserve office would consider Saturday as a business 
day for the purpose of computing availability of credit for checks 
collected through the Federal Reserve System. Prior to that time, 
Practices at Reserve Banks with respect to treating Saturday as a 
business day varied and their float totals reflected that fact. The 
major effect of this change was to eliminate time schedule float on 
inter-district country items dispatched on Fridays. 
Steps were also instituted to reduce remittance float by 
extending the use of automatic cash letter agreements to a larger 
number of member banks. These agreements provide that payments for 
cash letters will be made on a time schedule basis by a charge 
against the paying bank's reserve account, or against the reserve 
account of a correspondent, instead of depending upon mail remittances 
for such payments. Currently, 19 Federal Reserve offices have auto-
matic cash letter payment agreements in effect with payor banks, and 
the other 17 Reserve offices are at various stages in the development 
and implementation of this program. The practice of presenting 
yemittance drafts over the counter after clearing house closing hours 
is also being used where appropriate to reduce remittance float. 
Deliveries of checks by private carrier services are being 
expanded wherever economically justified. Such deliveries tend to 
reduce transportation and remittance float, and facilitate the 
adoption of the automatic cash letter payment agreements. 
In May and June 1967 the System conducted five regional 
float workshops to better acquaint personnel at the Reserve Banks with 
the operating and accounting aspects of float and to develop a clearer 
understanding of the problems related to float. 
On August 5, 1966, the System announced that, effective 
September 1, 1967, the Federal Reserve Banks would handle as cash 
items only those checks, drafts, and similar instruments that are 
encoded to show in magnetic ink the routing symbol-transit number and 
thus compatible with high-speed electronic processing. While this 
change in policy is mainly for the purpose of expediting and cutting 
the cost of check collection processing, it will also serve to reduce 
hold-over float by eliminating from the check collection stream un-
encoded items that require time-consuming special handling. The 
announcement of this change has already had a significant effect on the 
v°lume of such items. A survey in June of this year showed that out

of a daily average volume of 18.9 million items only about 300,000, or 
1.59 per cent, were not encoded for high-speed handling. 
These steps, in the aggregate, have brought about a dramatic 
decrease in the level of float. This is best seen by a comparison of 
the year-to-year monthly levels, remembering that these float reduc-
tion measures did not become significantly effective until the second 
quarter of 1967.

The results shown are more impressive as the increase in

While float is not a steady proportion of the number of items 
handled or the aggregate of their amount, its general level is respon-
sive to these volume indicators. The very large changes in float that 
have been apparent at times in the past are usually traceable to the 
disruption in communications due to adverse weather or strikes of 
transportation workers, or to processing equipment difficulties in the 
commercial banking system or at Federal Reserve Banks. 
While I am gratified that we have been able to accomplish 
the indicated reductions in float during the last several months, it is 
clear that the problem will require our continuing intensive attention 
during the period in which a "floatless" electronic inter-city funds 
transfer system is being developed. Basic progress is now being made 
in that direction through the rapidly growing reliance on processing 
°f checks at large computer centers. Moreover, the economies of 
automated processing and transmission are becoming increasingly apparen 
and a fully electronic system appears to be in prospect about as soon 
as dependable hardware and software facilities can be widely provided 
to the banking system. 
Sincerely yours, 
*
