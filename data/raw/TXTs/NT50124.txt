Administration dated July 25, 1967, recommend-
ing a change in the Board's Leave Regulations 
to permit excess annual leave unused at the 
end of a calendar year to be carried over and 
used in the next succeeding quarter. 
Report on competitive factors. Unanimous approval was given 
to the transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency of a report on 
the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of Glen Ridge 
Trust Company, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, into National Newark & Essex 
Bank, Newark, New Jersey. The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of National 
Newark & Essex Bank, Newark, New Jersey, and Glen Ridge 
Trust Company, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, would eliminate 
the existing and potential competition between them and 
increase the concentration of banking resources in Essex 
County. While the proposal will eliminate one banking 
alternative in Glen Ridge, the local residents would con-
tinue to have access to a reasonable number of alternative 
banking facilities. The overall effect of the proposal on 
competition would be adverse. 
The meeting then adjourned.

As requested in your letter of July 10, 1967, the Board

this letter. 
The foregoing consent is given with the understanding 
that the investment now being approved, combined with other for-
eign loans and investments of your Corporation and Manufacturers 
Hanover International Banking Corporation, will not cause the total

and that due consideration is being given to the priorities con-
tained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L. Carmichael

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letters of June 1 and 12, 1967, 
requesting a modification of the following condition contained in 
the Board's letter of May 29, 1967, which granted consent to Morgan 
Guaranty International Finance Corporation ("MGIFC"), New York, to 
continue to hold the shares of Morgan & Cie. S.A., ("Morgan & Cie."), 
Paris, France: 
"(1) That MGIFC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of stock in Morgan & Cie. if Morgan & 
Cie. at any time fails to restrict its activities 
to those permissible to a corporation in which a 
corporation organized under Section 25(a) of the 
Federal Reserve Act could, with the consent of the 
Board of Governors, purchase and hold stock, or if 
Morgan & Cie. establishes any branch or agency or 
takes any action or undertakes any operation in 
France or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to MGIFC; . . . " 
On the basis of the information and circumstances related 
in your letters regarding the operations and activities of Morgan & 
Cie, and subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
approves your continued holding of the stock of Morgan & Cie. if 
that company should issue and have outstanding debt obligations of 
the types referred to in Section 211.4 of Regulation K up to the 
equivalent of ten times the capital and surplus of Morgan & Cie.

Item No. 3 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
8/1/67 
Office Correspondence 
July 
1967. 
Board of Governors 
Carry-over of excess leave 
(via Governor KobertsonJ 
From 
Division of Personnel Administration 
Last December t is Division recommended, and the Board 
aoproved, changing its leave regulations for a trial period in 1967 as 
follows: 
1, Any employee having annual leave as of December 31* 1966, 
in excess of the amount permitted to be carried over is allowed until 
March 31, 1967, to use this excess. Any excess leave not used by March 
31, would be forfeited, with no exceptions, 
2. In the event of separation of the employee prior to 
March 31, 1967, any leave carried over in this manner will not be 
included in a terminal leave payment nor transferred to another Govern-
ment Agency or Federal Rpserve Bank. 
This recommendation was made to alleviate one of the more 
difficult supervisory nroblems of the Board, i.e., approving or denying 
requests for annual leave in the latter part of December. At that 
time supervisors aro faced with the difficult problem of accomplishing 
work assignments with a staff reduced both by employees on annual 
leave in order to be with their families for Christmas or employees 
being away on unused annual leave which otherwise they would lose. The 
Board's leave regulations (as does also the Civil Service rules) provide 
that an employee may accumulate a maximum of 30 days of annual leave as 
of the end of the year (except for a relatively few employees who had 
more than that amount at the time this rule was placed into effect) 
with any excess having to be used or the employee loses it. 
Attached is an analysis of the results of the trial period. 
There were 127 employees having a total of 3,360 leave hours on 
December 31, 1966, which otherwise would have been lost. The extension 
to March 31, 1967, resulted in a reduction to U7 employees with 1,23^.5 
hours actually lost at that time; therefore, approximately two-thirds 
of the employees were able to use about the same proportior of the leave 
carried over. 
This Division has asked the employees' Committee of the Board 
for comments on this recommendation for permanent revision of the leave 
regulations; and, also, wheth^^ March 31 would be an appropriate term-
ination date for this extension . The Committee, after a poll of its 
members, reported unanimous support of the continuation of the program 
and stated that the March 31 expiration date was generally considered 
satisfactory. 

3 0 9 * 
To: Board of Governors 
- 2 -
(via Governor Robertson) 
In addition, we discussed the experience during the trial 
period of this carry-over with the leave representatives of the various 
Divisions. Their unanimous opinion was that the program was sufficiently 
successful to justify permanent provision in the leave regulations and 
they predominantly endorsed the March 31 termination date. 
This Division, in its observance of the operation of this 
leave extension during the trial period believes, also, that it was a 
successful trial period and that the program should be made a permanent 
part of the leave regulations. The end-of-the-year leave problem is 
one that is present in all Government agencies and is the subject of 
much critical discussion among personnel people. Unfortunately, most 
agencies are under the Annual Sick Leave Act of 1.951 and it appears 
to be impracticable to revise the Act. Fortunately, the Board not 
being .under this Act, is in a position to change and it is believed 
that is should use its independence by doing so. 
It should be mentioned that it is quite possible that the 
carry-over of leave at the end of 1967 for both the number of employees 
and total leave hours will increase as a result of employees planning 
to take some of their leave in early 1968. This, however, does not 
cause any alarm on our part as the leave would be taken during a non-
peak leave period of th? year and would not be an administrative burden. 
The result should be a better program of annual leave both 
frQm an administration viewpoint, by alleviating year-end problems, 
and from tne employees' aspect, by making possible a more flexible 
utilization. 
Recommendation 
It is therefore recommended that the Board revise its ieave 
regulations as follows: 
. 1. Any employee with unused annual leaver as of December 31 
in any year, that would be excess of the amount permitted to be' carried 
over is allowed to use this excess before March 31, of the following 
year. Any such leave not used by the March 31 date will be forfeited, 
with no exceptions. 
2. Any leave carried over in this manner shall not be included 
in any terminal leave payment nor transferred to another Government 
agency or a Federal Reserve Bank in the event of separation of the employee 
prior to the March 31 date.

To:. Board of Governors

3. The excess annual leave carried over at the end of the 
regular leave year will be brought to the attention of the employee and 
the supervisor with the request that this leave be scheduled before 
March 31, during periods that are not inconvenient to the work load of 
the Division and to the plans of the supervisor, but taking into consider-
ation the plans of the employee.
