Discount rates. The establishment without change by the Fed-
eral Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco on 
May 15, 1969, of the rates on discounts and advances in their existing 
schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding that appro-
priate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
Officers's salary (Item No. 1). The Board approved unanimously 
t h e payment of an annual salary of $30,000 to H. Lee Boatwright, III, 
a s vi-ce President of the Baltimore Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank 
Richmond, effective July 1, 1969. A copy of the letter of approval 
Sent to the Reserve Bank is attached as Item No. 1. 
Hospitalization insurance coverage at Boston (Item No. 2). 
The Board approved unanimously a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank 
Boston interposing no objection to proposed changes in the Bank's 
basic medical/surgical health insurance plan, and authorizing the Bank 
t o Pay two-thirds of the premium costs for active and retired officers 
and employees of the Bank. A copy of the letter is attached as 
Itgn^No. 2. 
Mutual fund bill. Mr. Hexter reported to the Board that the 
Senate Banking and Currency Committee had rejected the recommendation 
o f the Board contained in its letter to the Committee of May 1, 1969, 
OQ C o / 
-J^, the mutual fund bill, that the Securities and Exchange 

1 G 3 ]

Commission rather than the Comptroller of the Currency be granted 
jurisdiction with respect to mutual fund operations by banks. The 
Committee had, however, accepted the Board's other recommendation 
that so-called "Smathers-Keogh" funds remain under the jurisdiction 
°f the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Mr. Hexter said that the staff had intended to present two 
additional recommendations concerning the bill to the Board for 
consideration. These recommendations related to restricting banks' 
operations in the mutual funds field to diversified open-end companies, 
and to restricting banks' operations in mutual funds to those imposing 
a "redemption fee" of 1 per cent or less of the value of the shares 
redeemed. 
in view of the fact that the Committee had now reported 
the bill^ Mr. Hexter indicated that it was too late to submit these 
recommendations to the Senate. 
Governor Robertson raised the question whether the Board 
should not submit the recommendations to the Senate for its consideration 
during floor debate. Mr. Cardon reported that a staff member of the 
Committee to whom he had talked suggested that the recommendations 
n°t be submitted to the Senate, but await action in the House of 
Representatives. Mr. Cardon said he believed this accurately repre-
Sented the views of the Committee members. 
The Board then agreed to defer consideration of the additional 
recommendations concerning S. 34.
