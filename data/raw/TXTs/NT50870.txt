Board member assignments. 
Chairman Burns had addressed to 
other members of the Board a memorandum dated January 17, 1972, indi-
cating his proposed changes in Board member assignments. No objec-
tions were indicated, and Chairman Burns made the changes in 
assignments effective immediately 
A copy of the memorandum is 
attached as Item No. 1. 
Discount rates. At today's meeting the Board continued its 
consideration of proposed changes in discount rates, which had been 
discussed on January 13. On January 6, 1972, the directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and St. Louis had established, 
subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, rates 
of 4-1/4 and 4 per cent, respectively, rather than the present 4-1/2 
per cent, on advances and discounts for member banks under sections 13 
and 13a of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Both Reserve Banks had also pro-
posed related changes in subsidiary rates. The Federal Reserve Bank 
of St. Louis renewed its proposal on January 13. 
No consensus developed in favor of action, and it was 
.understood that the question would be considered further at an 
early opportunity. 
The meeting then adjourned.
