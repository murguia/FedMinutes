after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the Board. 
Copies are attached under the respective numbers 
indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to First National City Bank, New York, 
1 
New York, acknowledging receipt of notice of 
its intent to establish an additional branch 
in Italy, to be located at 26 Via Boncompagni, 
Rome, incident to the acquisition of the assets 
a
nd assumption of the liabilities of the Rome 
branch of Intra Bank, Beirut, Lebanon. 
Letter to First Chicago International Finance

S e
n t to the acquisition of additional shares

(Holdings) Ltd. after acquisition by that com-
pany of all the shares of Drake America Corpo-
ration, New York, New York.

-3-
merger of Audubon National Bank, Audubon, New Jersey, into Haddonfield 
National Bank, Haddonfield, New Jersey, was approved unanimously for 
transmittal to the Comptroller. 
The conclusion read as follows: 
Some competition exists between Audubon National 
Bank, Audubon, New Jersey, and Haddonfield National 
Bank, Haddonfield, New Jersey. However, there would 
remain in the area several commercial banking alter-
natives, and the overall effect of the proposal on 
competition would be slightly adverse. 
A report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of Highlands National 
Bank of Renton, Renton, Washington, with Bank of the West, Bellevue, 
Washington, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Corporation. 
The conclusion stated that the proposed merger would have no adverse 
competitive effects. 
A report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Westminster National Bank, 
W e
stminster, California, and Commercial National Bank, Buena Park, 
California, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller. 
The conclusion stated that the proposed merger would have no adverse 
competitive effects. 
Shipment of Federal Reserve notes (Item No. 5). There had been 
distributed a memorandum dated August 22, 1967, from the Division of 
^
a
nk Operations and the Office of Defense Planning recommending approval, 
under section 7 of the Loss Sharing Agreement of the Federal Reserve 

332R 
8/24/67 
-4-
Banks, of shipments from the emergency stockpile of currency at the 
Salt Lake City Branch to Banks of issue in amounts up to $30 million 
each. 
(Under section 7 of the Loss Sharing Agreement, shipments of new 
notes are limited to $15 million except that, with the specific approval 
of the Board, larger shipments may be made from a supply that has been 
stored for emergency use.) 
In 1960, supplies of notes of the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, 
Chicago, and San Francisco Reserve Banks were disbursed from Washington, 
D. C., for storage in the vault of the Salt Lake City Branch as part of 
the emergency planning program. 
In 1965, as part of a broad plan devel-
oped by the Subcommittee on Emergency Operations, the Conference of 
Pre sidents recommended that three special vaults to be constructed at 
the Chicago Reserve Bank, the Denver Branch, and Culpeper, Virginia, be 
utilized for the storage of emergency supplies of Federal Reserve notes 
Banks of issue located in the central, western, and eastern areas of 
the United States, respectively. 
For reasons set forth in the distributed memorandum, it was pro-
Posed that notes of the New York Reserve Bank now be withdrawn from the 
Salt Lake City stockpile in shipments up to $30 million each, for which 
Brink's. Incorporated, would provide insurance coverage. 
These and suc-
ceeding shipments would permit Reserve Banks in the eastern part of the 
country to use notes presently held at Salt Lake City to meet current 
n
eeds, while current and future printings of notes for those Banks were 

t. 1«.>A* I

accumulated for storage at the Culpeper facility when it became avail-
able. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter to be sent to 
the Presidents of all Federal Reserve Banks and to the Federal Reserve 
Agents at New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco 
regarding the proposed action. 
Unanimous approval was given to the staff recommendation. 
A 
copy of the letter sent to the Presidents of the Reserve Banks and to 
the specified Agents is attached as Item No. 5. 
Application of Southeast Bancorporation. 
There had been dis-
tributed drafts of an order and statement reflecting the Board's 
a
Pproval on August 16, 1967, of the application of Southeast Bancorpo-
ration, 
Inc., Miami, Florida, to become a bank holding company through 
the acquisition of voting shares of The First National Bank of Miami; 
Coral Way National Bank, Miami; and Curtiss National Bank of Miami 
Springs. A dissenting statement by Governor Robertson had also been 
distributed. 
After Governor Mitchell had outlined reasons why he was not 
S a
tisfied with the majority statement as drafted, Governor Maisel noted 
that he had suggested certain changes to the Legal Division. 
However, 
Governor Mitchell's objections went more to the substance of the document. 
Consideration of the matter was then deferred until such time 
a s
 additional members of the Board were available, it being understood 

* W 2 ft 
8/24/67 
-6-
that in the meantime Governor Mitchell would review with the Legal 
Division the nature of the changes in the majority statement that he 
would have in mind. 
Survey of mortgage lenders (Item No. 6). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated August 23, 1967, from Mr. Brill in which 
it was proposed that a survey be undertaken by the Federal Reserve Banks 
around mid-September to ascertain current and prospective mortgage com-
mitment volume at leading representative commercial banks, mortgage 
companies, savings banks, and life insurance companies. 
In an attached 
draft of letter to the Banks there were set forth the questions that 
would be asked of the parties interviewed; these paralleled for the 
most part those contained in a questionnaire being utilized in connec-
tion with a similar survey to be made by the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board with respect to savings and loan associations. 
The questions 
Would essentially repeat those asked in the survey conducted last 
February. 
After the proposal had been summarized by Mr. Brill, Governor 
Maisel suggested certain changes in the proposed letter for purpose of 
clarification, and agreement was expressed with them. 
Governor Mitchell then referred to the portion of the instruc-
tions to the Reserve Banks that stated, in connection with the survey 
questions, that the term "normal" should be understood to apply roughly 
t o
 market conditions in the 1963-65 period. He expressed the view that 

8 3 2 9 
8/24/67 
-7-
persons interviewed would be unlikely to remember accurately what con-
ditions were like in the 1963-65 period and that it would therefore be 
Preferable to seek comparisons with a recent period such as the first 
Part of this year. 
Mr. Brill replied that the intent was to compare present con-
ditions with those that had prevailed during an easy money period. 
Also, there were seasonal factors to be considered in making compari-
sons with a period such as six months ago. He said that the deficien-
cies of a survey of this type, which relied on the impressions of those 
interviewed, were recognized. However, it was felt that it would be 
better to have information obtainable in such manner than no informa-
tion at all. 
Governor Mitchell reiterated his doubt that the questions, as 
framed, were within the ability of those interviewed to respond to 
meaningfully. 
He recalled that he had expressed similar reservations 
t o
 the staff in connection with previous ^surveys of like character. 
Governor Mitchell's reservations having been noted, the pro-
Posed survey was then authorized. Attached as Item No. 6 is a copy of 
the letter relating to the survey that was subsequently sent to the 
Reserve Banks. 
Either at this point in the meeting or earlier, members of the 
s
taff not concerned with the following topic withdrew from the meeting.

Matter relating to Treasury financing. Mr. Farrell reported 
on a meeting held at the request of representatives of the Treasury to 
discuss the possibility, suggested by the behavior of the market, that 
a leak may have occurred shortly prior to public announcement of the 
terms of the current Treasury financing last Thursday afternoon. 
Such 
a
 possibility had been mentioned in an article that appeared in the 
local press over the past week end. 
Mr. Farrell described the timing according to which messages 
containing the terms of the financing were transmitted by the Treasury 
over the Federal Reserve leased wire system to the Federal Reserve 
Banks, as fiscal agents, and their branches, and stated why the Trea-
sury believed that a leak had not occurred at that Department. 
One 
Possibility discussed, he said, was that a letter might be sent from 
the Treasury to the Federal Reserve Banks, either direct or through the 
Board, expressing concern and cautioning about security measures that 
should be employed in matters of this kind. 
In response to questions, Mr. Farrell explained why some period 
time was required to transmit such messages through the leased wire 
s
ystem and assure their availability at the Reserve Bank offices before 
t
he time of announcement to the press. 
Possible alternatives to the 
Present procedure were then suggested. 
When Mr. Farrell referred to 
t
he cost thereof as a deterrent to the Treasury, members of the Board 
e
*Pressed the view that if necessary consideration should be given to 

3331 
8/24/67 
-9-
the payment of such cost by the Federal Reserve. 
It was also noted 
that at such time as improved Federal Reserve communications facilities 
became available, problems of this character would be alleviated. 
Governor Mitchell suggested that Mr. Farrell discuss the matter 
further with the Treasury, particularly with a view to exploring the 
feasibility of utilizing alternative transmission procedures at Federal 
Reserve expense. He also suggested that the problem to which the Trea-
sury had called attention be discussed with the Reserve Bank Presidents 
when they were in Washington. 
It was further suggested that copies of the local press article 
he sent to the Reserve Bank Presidents for their information if it 
a
ppeared that the subj ect of the article had not been covered in the 
Press generally. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: 
Pursuant to the action taken 
by the Board at its meeting on April 24, 1967, 
Vice Chairman Robertson on June 27 selected by 
lot a new firm of certified public accountants 
to audit the books and accounts of the Board of 
Governors for 1967, the firm of Haskins & Sells 
having performed that service for a period of 
five years. 
The firm now selected, from among 
several that had not previously served as audi-
tors for the Board, was Lybrand, Ross Bros. & 
Montgomery. Attached as Item No. 7 is a copy 
of the letter sent by the Vice Chairman to 
Lybrand, Ross Bros. & Montgomery on August 23, 
1967, after it had been determined that the 
firm would be willing to undertake the assign-
ment if requested. Attached as Item No. 8 is 
a copy of the letter sent by the Secretary to 
Haskins & Sells.

Gentlemen; 
This will acknowledge your letter of August 17, 1967, 
(received August 21, 1967), advising pursuant to Regulation M , of 
your intention to establish an additional branch in Italy, to be 
located at 26 Via Boncompagni, Rome, Italy. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before September 1, 1968, it will be deemed that plans 
for its establishment have been abandoned, in which event authority to 
establish the branch under the notice furnished in your letter of 
August 17, 1967, will automatically terminate. 
Please inform the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, when the branch is opened for business. 
The 
Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in location 
°f the branch in Rome. 
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the form 
°f allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as 
foreign assets for purposes of the voluntary foreign credit restraint 
effort. However, it is understood that your bank will acquire the 
a
ssets and assume the liabilities of the Rome branch of Intra Bank, 
fi
eirut, Lebanon, (in liquidation) at a cost of approximately US$850,000 
that all disbursements occasioned by the acquisition will be made 
by your Milan, Italy, branch. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L. Carmichael

Assistant Secretary.

Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, 
Detroit 26, Michigan. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
authorizes your bank to accept drafts or bills of exchange drawn 
for the purpose of furnishing dollar exchange as required by the 
usages of trade in such countries, dependencies, or insular 
Possessions of the United States as may have been designated by 
the Board of Governors, subject to the provisions of Section 13 
°f the Federal Reserve Act and the Board*s Regulation C . 
Advice 
o f
 your desire for this authority was not received at the Board 
Prior to the request in your letter of August 1, 1967. 
Enclosed is a list of the countries with respect to 
w
hich the Board of Governors has found that the usages of trade 
require the furnishing of dollar exchange. 
The foregoing authorization has been given with the 
understanding that the foreign loans and investments of 
Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit will not exceed the guide-
lines established under the voluntary foreign credit restraint 
effort now in effect and that due consideration is being given 
t o
 the priorities contained therein. Your attention is also di-

Gentlemen: 
It is requested that your firm undertake, as promptly 
after January 1, 1968, as is convenient, an audit of the books and 
accounts of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
for the year 1967. 
As was explained in discussion with representatives of 
your firm, no restrictions have been or will be placed by the Board 
upon your firm as to the scope of the audit or the manner in which 
it is to be conducted, and you will make the audit as extensive and 
in such manner as appears to you to be desirable in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards. Compensation will be on the 
basis of the fees customarily charged by your firm for audit work 
of this type. 
For your information, there is enclosed a copy of a letter 
that is being addressed today to Haskins & Sells, which completed an 
audit of the Board's books for calendar year 1966, and with which 
firm it is assumed that you will wish to consult. Members of the 
Board and its staff will also stand ready to consult with representa-
tives of your firm regarding this work whenever that seems desirable. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

Gentlemen: 
Your company has, upon request of the Board of 
Go vernors, audited the books and accounts of the Board for each 
of the past several years. The latest of these audits was for 
calendar year 1966 for which your opinion was addressed to the 
Board under date of January 27, 1967. 
When the Board adopted the practice of employing a 
firm of public accountants to audit its books, it did so with 
the understanding that there would be rotation at approximately 
five-year intervals of the firms employed for that purpose. 
In 
keeping with that approach, it has requested the firm of Lybrand, 
Ross Bros. 6c Montgomery to undertake an audit of the Board's 
books and accounts for calendar year 1967. A copy of the letter 
being addressed today to Lybrand, Ross Bros. & Montgomery is 
enclosed, and it will be appreciated if you will afford represent-
atives of that firm an opportunity for consultation regarding such 
matters as seem appropriate in connection with their employment 
for auditing the Board's books covering the year 1967. 
The Board has appreciated the work performed by Haskins 
& Sells in connection with the audits of its books and accounts. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

Dear Sir: 
* Section 210.16 of the revision of the Board's Regulation J 
that will become effective September 1, 1967, provides that Federal 
Reserve Bank operating circulars governing the details of their opera-
tions in the handling of cash items and noncash items shall not be 
inconsistent with Regulation J. 
By letter of July 22, 1967, the Board indicated that in its 
judgment the proposed circulars of the Reserve Banks that are to 
become effective September 1, 1967, are consistent with the revised 
Regulation J. To assure that subsequent modifications of such 
operating circulars are also consistent with the Regulation, it would 
b e
 appreciated if every proposed change would be submitted to the 
Board for review. This, of course, includes proposed changes in 
interdistrict or intradistrict time schedules. 
In the light of the revision of Regulation J and the Reserve 
Banks' circulars, a number of Board letters relating to collection 
matters, which are included in the Federal Reserve Loose-Leaf Service,

Question has been raised whether the last sentence of

(S-2029) , requires submission of changes in time schedules for 
review by the Board. That sentence was not intended to suggest

It was intended only to reflect a continuation of the request 
made in the Board's letter of July 17, 1943 (F.R.L.S. Item 
No. 4450), that the Board be promptly advised of any changes in 
interdistrict or intradistrict time schedules.

situation.

Dear M r . Hirschler: 
Acting under delegated authority, the Director of the 
Division of Personnel Administration has approved the request con-
tained in your letter of August 17, 1967, for the appointments of 
Messrs. Robert E . Prosser and Malcolm J. Nelson as Alternate 
Assistant Federal Reserve Agents. 
This approval is given with the understanding that Messrs. 
Prosser and Nelson will be solely responsible to the Federal Reserve

duties, except that, during the absence or disability of the Federal 
Reserve Agent or a vacancy in that office, their responsibilities 
will be to the Assistant Federal Reserve Agent and the Board of 
Governors. 
When not engaged in the performance of their duties as 
Alternate Assistant Federal Reserve Agents, Messrs. Prosser and 
Nelson may, with the approval of the Federal Reserve Agent and the 
President, perform such work for the Bank as will not be inconsis-
tent with their duties as Alternate Assistant Federal Reserve Agents. 
It will be appreciated if Messrs. Prosser and Nelson are 
fully informed of the importance of their responsibilities as mem-
bers of the staff of the Federal Reserve Agent and the need for 
maintenance of independence from the operations of the Bank in the

Oath of Office which should be forwarded to the Board of Governors. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

W a n i n g of section 2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
(12 U.S.C. § 1841(a)) (the "Act"), has requested determinations by 
Board that the activities planned to be undertaken by its pro-
Posed subsidiaries, Farmers Insurance Agency, Inc., American Insurance 
A
gency, Inc., International State Insurance Agency, Inc., Farmers 
Agricultural Credit Co., Inc., and Carrington Credit Co., are of the 
kind described in section 4(c)(8)~~ of the Act (12 U.S.C. § 1843(c)(8))

Pursuant to the aforesaid order and notice, 
a hearing was 
held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 20, 1966, before a duly 
selected and designated hearing examiner. Applicant and the Board, 
the latter appearing in a non-advisory capacity, were represented at 
the hearing by counsel and were afforded the opportunity to be heard, 
to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to file briefs and proposed 
3/ 
findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
Subsequently, Applicant 
requested that the report and recommended decision of the hearing 
examiner be waived, which request was granted by the Board, and 
attendant thereupon Applicant waived the right to file exceptions 
under section 263.12(a) of the Board's Rules of Practice for Formal 
Hearings (12 CFR § 263.12(a)). 
Section 4(a)(1) of the Act forbids a bank holding company

Proposed insurance subsidiaries. - The purpose of three of 
the five proposed subsidiaries is to incorporate the insurance agency 
business now conducted by each of three of the Applicant's subsidiary 
banks on their respective premises, through their officers or employees 
acting as agents, and thus to protect each of the banks from liabili-
ties arising out of their insurance operations. It is planned that 
the stock of each of these three proposed subsidiaries will be 
offered to the respective stockholders of the related banks in the 
same proportion as they hold stock in the banks, and that the officers 
and directors of each subsidiary will be the same as those of the 
E l a t e d bank.

is common practice for State banks in Minnesota and North Dakota

a n
 insurance agency business in all substantial respects as its

Proposed agricultural credit company subsidiaries. - It 
is planned that the two remaining proposed subsidiaries will be 
agricultural credit companies, each affiliated with one of Applicant's 
subsidiary banks. Farmers Agricultural Credit Co., Inc. ("Farmers 
Credit") and Carrington Credit Co. ("Carrington Credit") are proposed 
North Dakota corporations which would engage exclusively in the 
business of making agricultural loans and discounting agricultural 
*°an paper with the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank. The subsidiaries 
V;
ould have no separate quarters or employees, but each would pay a 
to its affiliated bank for the use of space on the bank's premises 
and for the services of bank personnel. Each company would have an 
lr
*itial capitalization of $100,000; it is planned that the stockholders 
Farmers Credit will be the same as those of Farmers Bank and that 
stockholders of Carrington Credit will be the same as those of 
F 
°ster County State Bank, Carrington, North Dakota, the stockholders 
each bank being offered stock in the proposed affiliated credit 
Coi
^pany in the same proportions as they hold stock in the banks. The 
applicant owns more than 50 per cent of the stock of each of these 
b
anks. 
The purpose of the agricultural credit companies is to 
Provide a needed additional source of agricultural loans for the 
farmers in the areas served by the subsidiary banks of Applicant that 
^°uld be affiliated with the credit companies. The evidence shows 
t b
at each bank makes agricultural loans and frequently has demands 

3371 
-3-
for such loans well in excess of its legal lending limit. A Federal 
Intermediate Credit Bank is permitted to purchase agricultural loan 
paper from, and to discount such paper for, national and State banks, 
"ut the limitations on the amount that may be so acquired from a 
hank are considerably greater than in the case of an agricultural 
credit company. 
(12 U.S.C. § 1032) 
Several State banks in the Ninth Federal Reserve District 
are affiliated with agricultural credit companies. Applicant already 
o^ns one agricultural credit company and the reasons forming the 
basis for the Board's approval of that acquisition are generally 
6/ 
a
pplicable to the proposed acquisitions here. 
Conclusions. - It appears that the activities of Applicant's 
five proposed subsidiaries v/ould be of an insurance or financial 
nature and so closely related to the business of banking as conducted 
°y Applicant's subsidiary banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
a
nd as to make it unnecessary for the prohibitions of section 4 to 
a
pply in order to carry out the purposes of the Banking Holding 
Company Act. Accordingly, it is concluded that the applications 
should be approved. As indicated in the attached Order, if the facts 
u
Pon which approval of any one of the applications is based should 
C Q
ase to obtain in any material respect, such approval may be revoked.
