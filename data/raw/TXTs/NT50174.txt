of the holiday last Friday, November 10, the review included comments 
on the money market and related matters. The reports were based to 
some extent on material that had been prepared for the purpose of the 
Committee meeting, and copies of the relevant documentation have been 
placed in the Committee files. Copies of tables and charts pertinent 
to the money market review have been placed in the Board's files. 
Members of the staff except Messrs. Sherman, Kenyon, Brill, 
and Holland then withdrew from the meeting. 
Pound sterling developments. Governor Daane reported on discus-
sions in which he and Chairman Martin had participated over the past 
week end with U.S. Treasury officials, U.K. representatives, and others 
in regard to the position of the pound sterling and possibilities for 
arranging additional credit assistance to Britain. His remarks included 
reference to information received from System personnel who were attend-
ing the monthly meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in 
Basle. 
It was understood that the subject would be discussed further 
as developments unfolded, particularly insofar as participation by the 
Federal Reserve in any package of credit assistance might be proposed. 
(Note: 
The subject was considered at the meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee on Tuesday, November 14.) 
-t.s , 
Voluntary foreign credit restraint program. Governor Robertson 
S p o r t e d that he had presented to the Cabinet Committee on the Balance 
Payments the case for limiting the exemption from the voluntary

foreign credit restraint program for loans arranged or guaranteed by 
the Export-Import Bank or insured by the Foreign Credit Insurance Asso-
ciation. Following his presentation, however, the Secretary of the 
Treasury had said that he thought it was the majority view that the 
current exemption should be continued. 
It was planned that announce-
ment would be made later this week of the 1968 programs for banks and 
other financial institutions and for nonfinancial businesses. 
The 
program for banks and nonbank financial institutions would be in the 
form previously agreed upon by the Board except that the Export-Import 
Bank exemption would be continued. 
The meeting then adjourned.
