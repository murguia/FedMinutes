Discount rates. The establishment without change by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis on August 29 and by the Federal 
Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas 
c
ity, Dallas, and San Francisco on September 5, 1968, of the rates on 
discounts and advances in their existing schedules was approved 
unanimously, with the understanding that appropriate advice would be 
sent to those Banks. 
Charter New York Corporation. On recommendation by the 
State Superintendent of Banks, the New York Banking Board had approved 
the application of Charter New York Corporation, New York, New York, 
to acquire all of the outstanding voting shares of Central Trust 
Company Rochester, N. Y., Rochester, New York, and favorable action

by the Board of Governors had been recommended by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York. However, the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
and the Banking Markets Section recommended denial. Additional 
information, as requested by Board members at the meeting on 
August 27, had now been supplied by the staff under date of August 30, 
1968. 
The case was reviewed by the staff and there followed a 
discussion of various aspects of the matter during which comparisons 
were made with the application of Bankers Trust New York Corporation, 
New York, New York, to acquire shares of Liberty National Bank and 
Trust Company, Buffalo, New York, which application had been denied 
by the Board. 
The members of the Board then expressed their views. From 
those comments it appeared that three members (Governors Mitchell, 
Daane, and Sherrill) supported generally the analysis of the State 
Superintendent and the Reserve Bank and would therefore favor 
approval of the application, while the other three members present 
(Chairman Martin and Governors Maisel and Brimmer) concurred 
generally with the analysis of the Board's staff. In the circum-
stances, action on the matter was deferred until all members of the 
Board could be present. 
Kingston Trust Company. The Board's staff had recommended 
favorable action on an application of Kingston Trust Company, 

n *y oi? 
U G ' j U 
9/6/68

Kingston, New York, to merge The Kerhonkson National Bank, Kerhonkson, 
New York. However, the papers on the matter included certain ref-
erences to the possibility of merging the Kerhonkson bank with one 
of several other institutions, with indication that in some such 
cases the competitive effect might be more favorable. 
The case was reviewed and some of the members of the Board 
expressed a willingness to act on the application without further 
investigation. On the other hand, some members felt that it would 
be prudent to inquire further into the other reported merger 
possibilities and after discussion of the Board's responsibilities 
in such a situation the case was remanded to the staff with the 
request that consideration be given to means of obtaining for the 
Board additional information on the reported possible alternatives. 
Foreign banking matters• At the request of Governor Brimmer, 
action was deferred on an application by Morgan Guaranty International 
Banking Corporation, New York, New York, for modification of a 
previous Board authorization in such manner as to enable it to acquire 
presently outstanding as well as newly-issued shares of Banca Morgan 
Vonwiller S.p.A., Milan, Italy, in order to permit the staff to con-
sider further the question whether approval would require an exception 
to the guidelines of the foreign credit restraint program and, if so, 
whether such an exception would be warranted in the rather complex 
circumstances involved.

The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), New York, 
New York, had applied for permission to acquire the stock of a 
commercial bank, tentatively to be called The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(Geneva) S.A., to be organized in Geneva, Switzerland. If this 
was unacceptable to the Board, alternatives were proposed by Chase, 
namely, acquisition through Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corp-
oration, a wholly-owned subsidiary, or acquisition through The 
Chase Manhattan Trust Corporation Limited, Nassau, Bahamas, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corp-
oration. Only the latter alternative was considered acceptable by 
the Board's staff in view of the current guidelines of the foreign 
credit restraint program, and approval was recommended on that basis. 
Accordingly, unanimous approval was given to a letter to 
Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation in the form attached 
a s
 Item No. 1. such letter including language suggested by the New 
York Reserve Bank specifying that Chase Manhattan would maintain at 
its head office all such information as might be necessary for the 
proper administration of the Geneva bank by Chase and for proper 
evaluation of the investment by the Board's examiners. 
Unanimous approval was given to a letter to Manufacturers 
Hanover International Banking Corporation, New York, New York, 
(copy attached as Item No. 2), approving amendments to its articles 
of association to reflect a change of address, and to a similar 

9/6/68 
-6-
letter to Manufacturers Hanover International Finance Corporation, 
New York, New York, (copy attached as Item No. 3) . 
Unanimous approval was given to a letter to Bank of America 
National Trust and Savings Association, San Francisco, California, 
interposing no objection to the establishment of an additional 
branch in India, to be located in Madras. A copy is attached as 
Item No. 4. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competi-
tive factors involved in the proposed merger of The First National 
Bank at Stoystown, Stoystown, Pennsylvania, into The First National 
Bank of Berlin, Berlin, Pennsylvania, was approved unanimously for 
transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion 
stated that consummation of the merger would have no adverse competi-
tive effects . 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Union State Bank, Amery, Wisconsin, with State Bank of 
Deer Park, Deer Park, Wisconsin, was approved unanimously for trans-
mittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The conclusion 
stated that consummation of the proposed merger of the two banks, 
both subsidiaries of Otto Bremer Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota, a 
registered bank holding company, would have no adverse competitive 
effects.

Adjustment of salary structures. Unanimous approval was 
given to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City approving 
an adjustment of the salary structures applicable to employees at the 
head office and branches. A copy is attached as Item No. 5. 
Reports on monetary developments. With a memorandum of 
September 5, 1968, the staff submitted a revised draft of reply to 
Senator Proxmire's letter of July 30, 1968, in which he requested 
certain reports on monetary developments. The revised draft reflected 
several suggestions by Board members at the meeting on August 14, 1968, 
with respect to a previous draft. 
The memorandum also indicated that the staff had considered 
a suggestion at the August 14 meeting with respect to including in 
the proposed quarterly reports a retrospective discussion of monetary 
policy, such reporting to be delayed 60 days beyond the end of each 
quarter in order to avoid premature disclosure of policy considera-
tions . The memorandum pointed out that under current procedures 
considerably more than 60 days following each meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee ordinarily had been required to prepare and 
clear the language of the policy record entry. Also, as best the 
staff could judge, there appeared to have been several occasions 
since the effective date of the Public Information Act in mid-1967 
when release of particular policy record entries 60 days after a 
Committee meeting would have involved substantially enhanced risk

of undesirable public response. Further, it seemed likely that 
weaving a discussion of monetary policy into the proposed quarterly 
reports would add significantly to the staff workload. Accordingly, 
the staff believed that the best means of responding to Senator 
Proxmire would be in terms of an exposition of recent financial 
developments, without attendant policy discussion. 
During discussion of the revised draft of reply, Governor 
Brimmer indicated that he was satisfied with the staff explanation 
and supported the handling of the 
reports in the manner proposed. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the letter to 
Senator Proxmire, a copy of which is attached as Item No. 6. 
The meeting then recessed and reconvened in the Board Room 
a
t 2:00 p.m. with all members of the Board present and staff repre-
sentation appropriate to the subject scheduled for consideration. 
Charter New York Corporation. Further consideration was 
given to the application of Charter New York Corporation, New York, 
New York, to acquire all of the outstanding voting shares of Central 
Trust Company Rochester, N. Y., Rochester, New York. 
A vote then was taken and the application was denied, 
Chairman Martin and Governors Robertson, Maisel, and Brimmer voting 
to deny and Governors Mitchell, Daane, and Sherrill voting to approve.

Xt was understood that an order and statement reflecting the 
decision would be prepared for the Board's consideration and that a 
dissenting statement also would be prepared. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
In accordance with the request contained in your letters of 
M a
y 31, 1968, and July 24, 1968, the Board of Governors grants its con-
sent for your Corporation ("CMOBC") to continue to hold the stock of 
The Chase Manhattan Trust Corporation Limited ("CMTC"), Nassau, Bahamas, 
after CMTC acquires all of the shares of The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(Geneva) S.A. ("Chase Geneva"), a commercial bank to be formed in Geneva, 
Switzerland, at a cost of approximately $7,000,000, provided shares of 
a value of at least $6,000,000 are acquired within one year from the 
date of this letter. 
In this connection, the Board also approves the 
indirect purchase and holding of shares of Chase Geneva in excess of 
15 per cent of CMOBC's capital and surplus. 
The Board's consent to the proposed indirect purchase and 
holding of shares of Chase Geneva by CMOBC is granted subject to the 
following conditions: 
(1) That CMOBC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, any 
shares of stock in Chase Geneva if Chase Geneva at any 
time fails to restrict its activities to those permissible 
to a corporation in which a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, with the 
consent of the Board of Governors, purchase and hold stock, 
or if Chase Geneva establishes any branch or agency or takes 
any action or undertakes any operation in Switzerland or 
elsewhere, in any manner, which at the time would not be 
permissible to CMOBC; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, CMOBC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding the 
activities of Chase Geneva as it may require from time 
to time and that CMOBC maintain at its head office all 
such information as is necessary for the proper administra-
tion of Chase Geneva by CMOBC and for a proper evaluation 
of the investment by the Board's examiners; and 

o o l d o 
Chase Manhattan Overseas 
Banking Corporation 
-2-
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by Chase Geneva 
be reported under Section 211.8(c) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if Chase Geneva were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board suspends, 
until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of the immediately 
preceding paragraph of this letter so far as they relate to restrictions 
on loans granted by Chase Geneva in Switzerland in the currency of that 
country. 
Upon completion of the proposed acquisition, it is requested 
that the Board of Governors be furnished, through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, with copies of Association, Memorandum of Association, 
and By-Laws of Chase Geneva. 
Your attention is drawn to the provision of the guidelines 
for banks under the foreign credit restraint program which requests that 
no new nonexport credits be made to developed countries of continental 
Western Europe. In accordance with that provision, the Board would 
regard the use of the capital funds of CMTC, or other funds obtained by 
CMTC from residents of the United States for the purpose of making loans 
and investments in developed countries of continental Western Europe as 
not being consistent with the guidelines. It is understood that arrange-
ments have already been made for obtaining funds for the proposed invest-
ment from sources outside of the United States. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal

Dear Mr. Peterson: 
This will acknowledge Vice President L. J. Mulkern's 
letter of August 14, 1968 (received August 21, 1968), advising of 
your bank's intention to establish an additional branch in India, 
to be located in Madras and to be opened on September 10, 1968. 
The Board notes that the branch is to be established 
prior to the expiration of the thirty days' notice required by 
Section 213.3 of Regulation M. In this particular case, the 
Board interposes no objection to the branch in Madras being opened 
on September 10, 1968. However, as detailed in its letter of 
August 27, 1968, 
regarding the additional branch in Indonesia, the 
Board again wishes to express its concern with the failure of your 
institution to observe the statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before September 1, 1969, it will be deemed that 
plans for its establishment have been abandoned, in which event 
authority to establish the branch under the notice furnished in 
your letter of August 14, 1968, will automatically terminate. 
Please inform the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, when the branch is opened for business. 
The Board should be promptly informed of any future change in location 
of the branch in Madras. 

Mr. Rudolph A. Peterson 
- 2 -
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the 
form of allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be re-
garded as foreign assets for purposes of the foreign credit 
restraint effort. In view of the Board's concern with minimizing 
the impact of foreign investments on the balance of payments, this 
acknowledgment is given with the understanding that in the conduct 
of the branch's operations maximum reliance will be placed on 
resources obtained outside the United States. Accordingly, it is 
understood that any investment required will be made within the 
guidelines established under the foreign credit restraint effort 
now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending and investment 
activities of your bank, Bamerical International Financial 
Corporation, and Bank of America, New York, and that due considera 
tion is being given to the priorities contained therein.

The Honorable William Proxmire, 
Chairman, Joint Economic Committee, 
Washington, D. C. 
20510 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in reply to your letter of July 30, requesting 
certain reports on monetary developments from the Board. We 
have already indicated our willingness to provide, annually, 
staff projections of the financial developments that would be 
consistent with the economic prospects envisaged in the 
President's Economic Report. We will be prepared to submit 
these in early 1969. You will understand, of course, that it 
would not be appropriate or practicable in our view for us to 
provide predictions as to the future course of monetary policy. 
With reference to your request for special reports 
following any quarter in which the change of the money supply 
falls outside a specified range, it would seem to me that the 
Purposes of the Joint Economic Committee would be better 
served by more regular and more complete reporting of monetary 
a
nd financial developments, than by sporadic reporting which 
would be occasioned only by fluctuations in a single category 
of financial transactions. I would propose, therefore, that 
our staff prepare, for the use of your Committee, an analysis 
of significant developments following every calendar quarter. 
The reports would encompass analysis of changes in the money 
supply, narrowly defined, as well as of changes in the broader 
definition that includes all types of deposits, a concept we 
feel is more meaningful for analysis. Changes in these 
deposits would be interpreted in the context of the changes 
occurring in other financial flows and of interest rate 
developments in financial markets.

Since data for key elements of the financial picture 
become available only with some lag--here. I have particular 
reference to information on flows into thrift institutions--I 
would propose that the timing of these reports be approximately 
a month after the close of the quarter. If this suggestion meets 
with your favor, I will instruct the staff accordingly.
