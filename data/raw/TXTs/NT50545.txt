Euro-dollar borrowings. He asked that the staff prepare for his use 
material on the nature of such requests, including advice on whether 
it appeared that the requests were being observed and whether it was 
felt that the requests, perhaps in somewhat revised form, should again 
be called to the attention of the organizations concerned. 
On the status of the proposed changes in the foreign credit 
restraint program, Governor Brimmer reported having been advised that 
a new U.S. balance of payments program had been approved yesterday by 
the President, that the recommended adjustments in the Board's foreign 
credit restraint program had been accepted, but that proposals for 
substantial relaxation of the Commerce Department's foreign direct 
investment program had been rejected. He understood that it had been 
planned to make a public announcement this afternoon, but that the 
Secretary of Commerce had requested a delay and that an announcement 
next week was now contemplated. 
All members of the research divisions who had been present 
except Mr. Partee and Mr. Norwood (Division of International Finance) 
then withdrew from the meeting. Messrs. Broida, Cardon, Morgan, Bernard, 
and Metzger also withdrew and the following entered:

Discount rates. The establishment without change by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minne-
apolis, Dallas, and San Francisco on December 11, 1969, of the rates 
on discounts and advances in their existing schedules was approved 
unanimously, with the understanding that appropriate advice would be 
sent to those Banks. 
Reports on competitive factors. After a discussion during 
which it developed that a majority of the Board members favored citing 
the overall competitive effects of the proposed transaction as adverse 
rather than slightly adverse, a report on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed merger of New Jersey Bank (National Association), 
Clifton, New Jersey, and Jersey State Bank, River Edge, New Jersey, was 
approved for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency in a form 
in which the conclusion read as follows, and with the understanding 
that the staff would review the body of the report for the purpose of 
making any adjustments that appeared appropriate in light of the con-
clusion stated: 
There is some competition existing between New 
Jersey Bank (National Association), Clifton, and Jersey 
State Bank, River Edge, and there is potential for 
increased competition between them through de novo 
branching. The overall competitive effects of the 
proposed transaction would be adverse.

Governor Mitchell would have preferred a conclusion indicating 
that the overall competitive effects of the proposed transaction would 
be slightly adverse.

The Board had yesterday given consideration to the report to 
be made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of The First National Bank of 
Painted Post, Painted Post, New York, into Marine Midland Trust Company 
of Rochester, Rochester, New York. However, a decision had been deferred 
in view of a question raised by Governor Maisel with regard to the 
proper definition of the banking market in the Corning-Elmira, New York, 
area. The question was pertinent because another subsidiary bank of 
Marine Midland Banks, Inc., Buffalo, New York, was located in Elmira, 
about 20 miles distant from Corning and Painted Post. 
In a memorandum of December 11, 1969, the Banking Markets Section 
expressed the view, which was contrary to the view of the Banking Studies 
Department of the New York Reserve Bank, that Corning and Elmira probably 
should be considered as core areas of separte banking markets. 
In any 
event, however, it was believed that the competitive effect of the 
proposed merger should be regarded as only slightly adverse. 
While a "slightly adverse" conclusion was generally agreed 
upon, Governor Maisel continued to feel that the definition of banking 
market proposed by the Banking Studies Department was probably correct. 
After some discussion of that question, it was agreed to recognize in 
the report that there appeared to be a fair amount of commuting between 
the Elmira and Corning communities. 
A report in which the conclusion was stated as follows was then 
approved unanimously for transmittal to the Corporation:

Consummation of the proposed merger would eliminate 
little existing or potential competition between The First 
National Bank of Painted Post and Marine Midland Trust Com-
pany of Rochester, a subsidiary of Marine Midland Banks, Inc., 
Buffalo, a -registered bank holding company. The transaction 
would increase slightly the concentration of banking resources 
in the two largest banks in the Eighth Banking District of New 
York State. The overall competitive effect of the proposed 
transaction would be slightly adverse. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Salary structures at San Francisco Bank. The Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco had requested approval, effective January 1, 1970, 
of revisions in the salary structures applicable to positions of employees 
at the head office and the branches, along with an increase from $22,000 
to $24,000 in the special maximum for grade 16 in the San Francisco-Los 
Angeles structure. 
In a memorandum of December 10, 1969, the Division 
of Personnel Administration recommended favorably. 
Governor Brimmer noted that the proposal was a conservative 
one, too conservative in his opinion, in that the revised structures, 
even as they became effective, would apparently be below the markets in 
the respective communities. 
In his judgment this was not indicative of 
sound salary administration policy, and he felt that the matter should 
be called to the attention of the Reserve Bank. He recalled that the 
Board's Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans had 
had some discussion with representatives of the Bank in respect to 
officer salaries, which had been allowed to drift behind and which it was 
now being found necessary to build up.

After discussion of alternative procedural possibilities in 
light of the question raised by Governor Brimmer, the proposed revised 
salary structures were approved unanimously effective January 1, 1970, 
with the understanding that the Board's Committee would undertake, on 
a convenient occasion, to review with representatives of the Reserve 
Bank the problem of salary administration policy that might be involved. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Reserve Bank pursuant to this action 
is attached as Item No. 1. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Salaries should be paid to employees within the limit specified 
for the grades in which their respective positions are classified. 
It 
is noted in your letter that all employees whose salaries are below 
the minima of their respective grades as a result of the structure in-
crease will be brought to appropriate ranges by April 1, 1970. 
The Board also approves your request for an adjustment in 
the special maximum for Grade 16 from $22,000 to $24,000. 
Very truly yours, 
K 'Joth A. Konyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.
