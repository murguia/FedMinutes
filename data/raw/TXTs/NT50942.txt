St. L o u i s , M i n n e a p o l i s , and Dallas on July 2 7 , 1972, of the rates on 
discounts and advances in their existing schedules was approved unan-
imously, with the understanding that appropriate advice would be sent 
to those Banks. 
The Board authorized issuance of an order reflecting approval 
on July 2 0 , 1972, of the application of A m e r i c a n Bancorporation, 
C o l u m b u s , O h i o , to acquire shares of The Farmers State Bank of M c C l u r e ,

A copy of the order is attached as Item No. 1. 
Pursuant to the recommendation in a m e m o r a n d u m from the Divi-
sion of Supervision and Regulation dated A u g u s t 1, 1972, the Board unan-
imously approved publication of a proposed amendment to Regulation Z , 
Truth in L e n d i n g , for public c o m m e n t . 
The amendment would specify that 
all credit c a r d s , regardless of use or cardholder status, are covered 
by the $50 m a x i m u m liability limit and are subject to the prohibition 
against unsolicited d i s t r i b u t i o n . 
A copy of the notice published in 
the Federal Register is attached as Item N o . 2. 
This concluded consideration of the consent calendar.

Thrift institutions. 
At several m e e t i n g s , most recently on 
May 16, 1972, the Board had considered adding the operation of a savings 
and loan a s s o c i a t i o n to the list of permissible activities under section 
4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company A c t . 
A t the May 16 meeting the 
Board deferred action with the understanding that Chairman Burns would 
confer with Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Committee on B a n k i n g , 
H o u s i n g , and Urban Affairs about the general question of bank holding 
company operation of thrift institutions. 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated July 3 1 , 1972, the Legal Division proposed 
three alternative courses of action available to the Board: 
(1) order 
a hearing and solicit written comments on the operation of savings and 
loans as a permissible activity; (2) determine that operation of a 
savings and loan is not a permissible activity and issue a press release 
in that regard; and (3) notify applicants that processing of their 
pending applications to acquire or retain savings and loan associations 
would be suspended for an indefinite p e r i o d . 
Attached to the memoran-
dum were draft documents that would implement the various a l t e r n a t i v e s . 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated August 1 , 1972, M r . Cardon recommended issuance 
of a press release stating that the Board had decided not to add opera-
tion of savings and loan associations to the list of permissible activ-
ities for bank holding c o m p a n i e s . 
A t today's meeting Chairman Burns reported on his conversation 
with Senator S p a r k m a n , who had said that the question of bank holding 

2046 
8/3/72 
-4-
companies operating savings and loan associations did not come up during 
the Congressional hearings before the e n a c t m e n t of the Bank Holding 
Company A c t amendments of 1970. 
H o w e v e r , the Senator felt that if the 
question had arisen Congress would not have been willing to have savings 
and loan associations treated as subsidiaries of bank holding c o m p a n i e s . 
Chairman Burns thought there was no question that savings and 
loan associations were closely related to b a n k i n g . 
H o w e v e r , in light 
of his conversation with Senator Sparkman and other c o n s i d e r a t i o n s , 
he suggested that the Board should announce that it h a d decided not to 
include at the present time the operation of thrift institutions on the 
list of permissible activities for bank holding c o m p a n i e s . 
He noted 
that the next Congress w o u l d h a v e the opportunity to review bank and 
savings and loan relationships if it considered the report by the Pres-
ident's Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation (Hunt C o m m i s s i o n ) . 
Governors M i t c h e l l , D a a n e , and Sheehan indicated that they agreed 
with Chairman B u r n s . 
Governor Brimmer also believed that the Board 
should exclude operation of a savings ,and loan association from the list 
of permissible a c t i v i t i e s , but without reference to the possibility of 
reconsidering the question at some time in the future. 
Governor Robertson 
felt that operation of a savings and loan association should be consid-
ered a banking activity rather than an activity closely related to bank-
ing, and that adding this activity to the list of permissible activities 
w o u l d allow a b a n k holding company to have a subsidiary bank in every 
State. 
In h i s v i e w , this was a question that should be dealt with by 

2047 
8/3/72 
-5-
the Congress and not by the B o a r d . 
C o n s e q u e n t l y , he believed that 
the Board should exclude this activity from its permissible list. 
A f t e r further discussion the Board concluded t h a t , at this 
time, the operation of savings and loan associations was not a permis-
sible activity for b a n k holding companies and approved the issuance of 
a press release in the form attached as Item N o . 3 . 
United Jersey B a n k s . 
In memoranda dated July 2 1 , 1972, the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of the 
applications of United Jersey B a n k s , H a c k e n s a c k , New J e r s e y , to acquire 
shares of The Dover Trust C o m p a n y , D o v e r , New J e r s e y , and The Second 
National Bank of O r a n g e , O r a n g e , New J e r s e y . 
It was noted that the 
applicant's lead b a n k , Peoples Trust of New J e r s e y , H a c k e n s a c k , New 
J e r s e y , was u n d e r c a p i t a l i z e d , and the Division recommended as a condi-
tion for a p p r o v a l of both applications that the applicant be required 
to inject $15 million in equity capital into Peoples T r u s t . 
As a 
condition for approval of the acquisition of The Dover Trust C o m p a n y , 
the Division also recommended the injection of $1 million into the 
capital accounts of that b a n k . 
The Banking Markets Section and the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New Y o r k recommended approval of both appli-
cations subject to injection of the additional capital. 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated July 2 4 , 1972, M r . Leavitt outlined an 
alternative proposal for Peoples Trust by the a p p l i c a n t , n a m e l y , to add 

2048 
8/3/72 
-6-
$10 m i l l i o n of equity capital and $5 m i l l i o n of debt c a p i t a l , which 
w o u l d be converted to equity not later than June 3 0 , 1974. 
Today's discussion was devoted primarily to the alternative 
proposal for the injection of capital into the lead b a n k , and the 
B o a r d agreed to require the a d d i t i o n of the entire $15 m i l l i o n as 
equity c a p i t a l . 
Governor Robertson said that he would not approve the acquisi-
tion of The Dover Trust C o m p a n y , because the proposed acquisition 
would have an adverse effect on future c o m p e t i t i o n . 
The Board thereupon approved the application to acquire The 
Dover Trust C o m p a n y , Governor R o b e r t s o n d i s s e n t i n g , and unanimously 
approved the a p p l i c a t i o n to acquire The Second National Bank of O r a n g e . 
It was understood that appropriate orders would be prepared for the 
Board's c o n s i d e r a t i o n , along with a dissenting s t a t e m e n t . 
W o r c e s t e r B a n c o r p . 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated July 19, 1972, the 
Division of Supervision and R e g u l a t i o n recommended approval of the 
application of Worcester B a n c o r p , Inc., W o r c e s t e r , M a s s a c h u s e t t s , to 
acquire shares of The First National Bank of A m h e r s t , A m h e r s t , Massachu-
s e t t s . 
The Banking Markets Section and the Federal Reserve Bank of 
B o s t o n also recommended a p p r o v a l . 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated July 3 1 , 1 9 7 2 , 
the Banking Markets Section and the Division of Supervision and Regu-
lation reviewed the nonbanking activities of the applicant and recom-
m e n d e d no curtailment of its grandfather p r i v i l e g e s .

After a brief discussion of the nonbanking activities of the 
a p p l i c a n t , the Board unanimously approved the application and authorized 
the issuance of an order reflecting that d e c i s i o n . 
It was understood 
that the order would specify that in permitting the applicant to retain 
its grandfathered land development c o m p a n y , the Board had not altered 
its position that land development is not a permissible activity under 
section 4 ( c ) ( 8 ) of the Bank Holding Company A c t . 
A copy of the order 
is attached as Item No. 4 . 
C e n t r a l B a n c o r p o r a t i o n . 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated July 18, 1972, 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation recommended approval of the 
application of The C e n t r a l B a n c o r p o r a t i o n , Inc., C i n c i n n a t i , O h i o , 
to acquire shares of the successor by merger to First National Bank 
of C a n t o n , C a n t o n , O h i o . 
The Banking Markets Section and the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland also recommended a p p r o v a l . 
Governors Robertson and Brimmer favored denial of the a p p l i c a t i o n , 
since they did not feel that the public benefits resulting from the 
acquisition would outweigh the adverse effects on c o m p e t i t i o n . 
The Board approved the a p p l i c a t i o n , Governors Robertson and 
Brimmer d i s s e n t i n g , and authorized issuance of an order reflecting 
that d e c i s i o n . 
A copy of the order is attached under Item N o . 5 , along 
w i t h a dissenting statement of Governors Robertson and B r i m m e r . 
R e g u l a t i o n A . 
In a m e m o r a n d u m dated June 16, 1972, M r . Holland 
discussed the status of the proposed revision of Regulation A , Advances 
and Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks. 
He indicated that the language

credit, (3) seasonal borrowing p r i v i l e g e , (4) emergency credit to 
member b a n k s , and (5) emergency credit to o t h e r s . 
The discussion that 
followed was devoted primarily to the basic and seasonal borrowing 
privileges. 
Under the basic borrowing privilege member banks would have 
access to credit upon request w i t h i n precisely stated limits for amounts 
and frequency and on specified c o n d i t i o n s . 
Under the seasonal borrowing 
privilege member banks would have access to credit on a longer-term 
and on a prearranged basis to meet seasonal needs. 
M r . H o l m e s , Manager of the System Open M a r k e t A c c o u n t , discussed 
possible effects on open market operations of the proposed seasonal and 
basic borrowing p r i v i l e g e s . 
He felt that seasonal borrowing, which would 
for the most part be prenegotiated and d e f i n i t e , w o u l d not be difficult 
to offset with open m a r k e t o p e r a t i o n s . 
H o w e v e r , he was somewhat concerned 
about problems that m i g h t be encountered in trying to offset the effects 
of the basic borrowing p r i v i l e g e . 
During discussion Governor M i t c h e l l raised a question whether 
some portions of the reappraisal of the discount mechanism might be 
o b s o l e t e , since the study had been undertaken several years a g o . 
He 
favored adoption of the seasonal borrowing privilege, but expressed 
reservations about the basic borrowing privilege. 
Similar reservations 
were expressed by o t h e r s , and questions were raised as to the timing of 
any announcement of Board action with respect to R e g u l a t i o n A revisions.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
AMERICAN BANCO RPORATION 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
American Bancorporation, Columbus, Ohio, a bank holding company 
within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied for the 
Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to 
acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares (less directors' qualifying 
shares) of The Farmers State Bank of McClure, Ohio, McClure, Ohio 
("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
§ 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, 
and none has been timely received. The Board has considered the 
application in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls four banks with deposits of $18.7 million, 
representing .08 per cent of aggregate deposits of coamercial banks in 
°hio. (All banking data are as of December 31, 1971, and reflect 
holding company formations and acquisitions approved through May 31, 1972.) 
The acquisition of Bank with deposits of $6.3 million would not appreciably 
increase the concentration of banking resources in any relevant area, 
and Applicant would retain its rank as the smallest bank holding company 
in the State. 
Bank serves Henry County in the northwestern part of Ohio, There 
are six banks headquartered in the county with deposits ranging from 
$4.5 million to $22.4 million. Bank controls 11.6 per cent of county 

deposits and is the third largest of these banks. Consummation of the 
proposal should have no adverse effects on any of the competing banks. 
The closest offices of Applicant and Bank are 78 miles apart, 
and no significant present competition exists between any of these 
offices. In addition, there does not appear to be any potential for 
the development of future competition between the two institutions, 
due to the distances separating their offices, the location of numerous 
intervening banks, and the restrictions placed on branching by State 
laws. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its 
subsidiary banks, and Bank are considered to be generally satisfactory, 
and prospects for the group appear favorable. Therefore, considerations 
relating to the banking factors are consistent with approval of the 
application. Applicant proposes to expand and improve the present 
services offered by Bank to include specialized consumer and business 
loan programs. Although the major banking needs of the area are being 
served at the present time, Applicant's assistance to Bank in loan 
Participation with other affiliates, and in training and management 
Planning would better serve the convenience and needs of the communities. 
Considerations under this factor are consistent with approval of the 
application. It is the Board's judgment that consummation of the 
proposed acquisition would be in the public interest and that the 
application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
(a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of 

- 3 
this order or (b) later than three months after the effective date of 
this Order, unless such period is extended for good cause by the Board, 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland pursuant to delegated 
authority.

to amend Part 226 (Regulation 1) in the manner and for the reasons set 
forth below:

exemption in G 226.3 of Regulation Z for extensions of credit for business 
and commercial purposes applies to the unsolicited issuance of credit cards 
to tho limits on liability for their unauthorized use. The purpose 
these proposed amendments Is to make clear that all credit cards, 
l'
e£ardless of use or cardholder status, are covered by the maximum 
liability limit nnd, by the same token, may not be distributed without an 
request from the cardholder. These amendments would not effect

*°r immediate release 
August 3, .1972 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced 
to'3ay that: it lies decided not: to include at the present time operation 
o f savings and loan associations on its list of activities in uhich bank 
ac.ldin3 companies i.uov engage. 
The Board had previously indicated that operation oi a savings 
Q n d 
i o a n association was not within the scope of activities heretofore 
authori'£'.ed to be conducted by a bank holding company under section 4(c)(0) 
l,f the Bank Holding Ccmpony Act, and that it v;a& then considering 'whether 
t o expand its list of activities to include such activity. 
The Hoard noted that Congress has created a statutory frorework 
or savings and loan association?; that is separate from the statutes 
fcovctning ior.suer.cinl hanks. Up dor these statutes, different rules have 
b o e ; i established for the two kinds of institutions en such matters as 
Ranching, taxation* and ceilings on rates paid to attract savings. A 
statute has also been enacted governing s a v i n g and loan holding companies, 
C e?nrate and distinct from the Bank Holding Company Act. This statutory 
pattern suggests past intent on the pc.rt or Congress to maintain savings 
and loan associations as specialised lenders to finance housing, with 
specialized rules appropriate to that sols. Acquisition cf saving* and 
association* by bank holding companies could tend to l>Iur this 
r' £ r<s s :j ion a 3.3. y - e s t. a fc li;5 he d s t r 110 f. u re .

Proposals for affiliation, of banks and savings and loan 
assoelationq in a holding company system involve broad questions of 
Public policy which, ir. the Board's opinion, should not be decided until 
Congress has had an opportunity to consider the matter. Suggestions for 
eli&ri&oK in rules governing specialized thrift institutions have been made 
b y the President's Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation (the 
"Hunt Commission'
1), as well as others. It is cxpected that the next 
Congress will have occasion to thoroughly consider bank and savings and 
loan association relationships. 
The action announced today does not affect previous Board 
decisions permitting affiliations of thrift institutions and commercial 
faults in Rhode Island.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WORCESTER BANCORP, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Worcester Bancorp, Inc., Worcester, Massachusetts, a bank 
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, 
h a s applied for the Board's approval under 5 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 
U«S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire all of the voting shares of First 
National Bank of Amherst, Amherst, Uassachusetts (
! Bank
1'). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for interested 
Persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance with 
® 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and views has expired, and 
^he Board has considered the application and all comments received in 
l ight of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1342(c)). 
Applicant, the sixth largest banking organization in Massachusetts, 
controls one bank with aggregate deposits of $336.3 million, representing 
2*9 per cent of total deposits of commercial banks in the State. 
(All 
banking data are as of December 31, 1971, and reflect bank holding company 
formations and acquisitions approved through Hay 31, 1972.) Approval of 
t^is application would not significantly increase Applicant's share of 
Statewide deposits and its present ranking would not change. 
Bank, with deposits of $25.2 million, is the largest of six banks 
its banking market, which is approximated by central Hampshire County and 
Portions of Franklin County, and controls 32 per cent of deposits in 
commercial banks in that market.

Applicant's acquisition of Bank would constitute its initial 
entry into Bank's market and Hampshire County. Applicant's closest 
listing subsidiary banking office is located approximately 30 miles 
from Bank. Mo meaningful competition exists between Bank and any of 
Applicant's existing subsidiary banking offices, nor does it appear likely 
that such competition would develop in the future, in viex; of the distances 
separating Bank from Applicant's subsidiaries, the State's restrictive 
Ranching laws and the relatively static economic conditions in Bank's 
Market. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects of 
Applicant, its subsidiaries and Bank are generally satisfactory and consistent 
*ith approval of the application. In addition, it is expected that Appli-
cant's acquisition of Bank will add depth to the management of Bank. Although 
there is no evidence that the banking needs of the communities involved are 
not being adequately met at present, Applicant expects to offer, through 
Bank, a broader range of financial services to Bank's customers. 
Considera-
tions relating to the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
are, therefore, consistent with approval of the application. It is the 
Board's judgment that consummation of the proposed acquisition would be 
in the public interest, and that the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application Is approved for 
the reasons summarized above. The approval herein neither provides 
authority to Applicant to continue in the nonbank activities nor to 

2 0 . 6 2 
-3-
r®tain nonbank shares nor requires the Applicant to modify or terminate said 
activities or holdings. However, consummation of the proposal herein is 
subject to the continuing authority of the Board to require modification or 
termination of such activities or holdings (within a period no shorter than 
2 years), if the Board determines that the continued combination of banking 
an<* nonbanking interests is likely to have an adverse effect on the public

interest. The transaction shall not be consummated (a) before the thirtieth 
C alendar day following the effective date of this Order or (b) later than 
three months after the effective date of this Order, unless such period is 
^tended for good cause by the Board, or by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
^°ston pursuant to delegated authority.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
THE CENTRAL BANCORPORATION, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
The Central Bancorporation, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, has 
applied for the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent of the 
1 
voting shares (less directors' qualifying shares) of the successor 
by merger to First National Bank of C a n t o n , C a n t o n , Ohio ("Bank"). 
i 
The bank into which Bank is to be merged has no significance 
except as a means to facilitate the acquisition of the voting shares of 
Bank. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition of the successor organiza-
tion is treated herein as the proposed acquisition of the shares of 
Bank. 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for 
interested persons to submit comments and views, has been given in 
accordance with § 3(b) of the Act. The time for filing comments and 
j 
views has expired, and the Board has considered the application and 
all comments received in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of 
the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant, the tenth largest banking organization and sixth 
largest multi-bank holding company in Ohio, controls five banks with 
deposits of $605.7 million. 
(All banking data are as of December 31, 
1971, and reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved 
through May 31, 1971.) The acquisition of Bank ($157 million deposits) 
would increase Applicant's share of total State deposits b y .67 percent-
if 
. • 
age points, and although it would become the ninth largest banking 
organization, it would remain the sixth largest multi-bank holding 

-2-
2 0 S 1 
company in Ohio. Consummation of the acquisition would not result in 
any undue concentration of banking resources within the relevant areas 
of the State. 
Bank is headquartered in Canton, and operates ten offices in 
Stark County and one office in Carroll County. Bank is the second 
largest of 15 banks in the Canton banking market, and holds 21 per 
C e n t of the total deposits for the market. Applicant does not compete 
the market at the present time, and the closest banking offices of 
fiank and Applicant are 80 miles apart. Applicant's other affiliates 
are located between 100 and 250 miles from Canton and none of its sub-
sidiaries obtains any substantial amount of banking business from the 
Canton market. It appears that there is little likelihood for the 
development of any substantial amount of future competition between 
offices of Applicant and Bank due to the distances separating the 
banking offices and the cross-county branching limitations imposed 
by 
State laws. Should Bank become the nucleus for the formation o-f a 
Sfnall bank holding company, Applicant and Bank might compete in local 
markets in the future. This factor could have a slightly adverse 
effect on possible future competition. However, in considering the 
future development of the overall banking structure in Ohio, there 
a number of large banks in the State that could develop into hold-
ing companies over time. Thus, the loss of Bank as a potential member 
°f a holding company would not have a serious anticompetitive effect. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its 
subsidiary banks and Bank are generally satisfactory, and prospects 
for each appear favorable. Banking factors are consistent with 
aPproval of the application. 

2 0 6 3 
-3-
The major banking needs of the Canton area are presently 
being served. However, the population of Stark County, primarily 
centered in Canton,is rapidly increasing along with its industrial 
expansion. Credit is needed to finance the purchase of homes and 
automobiles, as xjell as to support the expansion in industrial activity. 
Bank has been limited heretofore in its lending activities. Applicant 
proposes to increase Bank's lending capabilities, expand its trust 
services and make international services available at Bank. The ex-
panded and enlarged services Bank would be able to offer its customers 
^ould serve the convenience and needs of the communities. 
Therefore, 
considerations under this factor are consistent with and lend support 
fco approval of this application. It is the Board's judgment that the 
convenience and needs aspects of the instant proposal outweigh the 
slightly adverse competitive consequences and that consummation of 
the proposed acquisition would be in the public interest, and that 
the application should be approved. 
On the basis of the record, the application is approved 
for the reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be 
consummated (a) before the thirtieth calendar day following the 
effective date of this Order, or (b) later than three months after 
the effective date of this Order, unless such period is extended

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNORS ROBERTSON AND BRIMMER 
We would deny this application because there are no 
[r 
overriding public benefits which result from the affiliation to out-
weigh the adverse effects on competition or to bring the proposal 
within the exception prescribed in the Bank Holding Company Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1842). 
Bank is located in Canton, the county seat of Stark County -
approximately 57 miles from Cleveland, 37 miles from Youngstown, and 
23 miles from Akron. It serves the Canton Market, a highly industrialized 
/
area with a population of 400,000. It holds deposits of $157.1 million 
(representing 21.0 per cent of total deposits), and it ranks as the 
second largest of 15 banks in the market. Applicant, with deposits 
°f $605.7 million, centers its operations in Cincinnati where its 
lead bank holds deposits of $519.5 million. 
The acquisition of Bank would give Applicant control of 
aggregate deposits of $762.7 million, representing an immediate increase 
of 26 per cent. The 15 Canton Market banks operate 52 offices and 
control deposits ranging from $4 million to $186 million. The three 
largest of these banks (including Bank) control 64 per cent of total 
deposits. The acquisition by Applicant of the second largest bank in 
fche market would further strengthen Bank's position and would solidify 
the high degree of concentration of banking resources already present 
there. As a result of consummation of the acquisition, the 12 smaller 

2068 
-2-
Canton Market banks, with deposits ranging from $4 to $54 million, 
would be placed in an even more difficult competitive position. 
Applicant is capable of entering the market de novo or through 
acquisition of a smaller area bank. Either of these alternatives could 
have procompetitive effects on area banking. We are also mindful that 
this acquisition forecloses future competition between Applicant's 
subsidiaries and Bank. That institution, the twenty-fourth largest 
banking organization in Ohio - absent this proposal - is a potential 
lead bank in a local or possible Statewide bank holding company formation. 
Our review of the record indicates that convenient and full 
banking services are made available to residents of the area by exist-
ing financial institutions and that no unserved public need or benefit 
would be added by consummation of this proposal. We have concluded, 
therefore, that banking competition in Ohio on a local and Statewide 
basis would best be served by a denial of this application and by re-
quiring Applicant to resort to less anticompetitive means of entry.
