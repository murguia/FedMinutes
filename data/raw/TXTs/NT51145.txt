Margin requirements. Today's meeting was called to give further 
consideration to possible amendments to Regulations G, T, and U, relating 
to securities credit, that would reduce margin requirements on certain 
securities. At its meeting on November 19, 1973, the Board had agreed 
to defer consideration of this matter in light of unstable conditions 
in the stock markets. 
After discussion it was agreed that, in light of the continuing 
instability in stock prices, action to reduce margin requirements would 
not be appropriate at this time. 
The meeting then adjourned.
