Report on competitive factors. Pursuant to the understanding 
tit th 
n
e meeting on July 21, 1967, the Division of Examinations had dis-
S e
d with the Banking Markets Section the appropriate definition of 
e r 
"ttrket area served by The Grove City National Bank, Grove City, 
•• ' 'si ' • v. 
Pen 
ylvania, for purposes of making a report to the Federal Deposit 
Insura

Posed n, 
merger of that bank with Northwest Pennsylvania Bank & Trust Co., 
0 i
i c i L Pennsylvania.

There had now been distributed memoranda dated July 24, 1967, 
from the Division of Examinations and the Banking Markets Section in 
which the relevant market area was described as one lying within approx-
imately a 20-mile radius of Grove City. Appropriate changes had been 
made in the body of the report. 
Governor Mitchell indicated that he was satisfied with the 
report as now prepared. He felt that the information presented therein 
strengthened the basis for the stated conclusion. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the transmittal of the 
report to the Corporation, the conclusion reading as follows: 
The proposed merger of The Grove City National Bank, 
Grove City, Pennsylvania, with Northwest Pennsylvania Bank 
& Trust Co., Oil City, would eliminate a small amount of 
competition existing between them and would increase the 
concentration of banking resources in the area presently 
served by The Grove City National Bank. The overall effect 
°f the transaction on competition would be adverse. 
Preparation of competitive factor reports (Item No. 1). Governor 
Mitchell observed that the report just considered pointed up a concern 
had had for some time, namely, that on occasions the Board's competi-
tive fo 
ractor reports were prepared without adequate economic analysis of 
the ^rkets involved. He suggested that the Reserve Banks be asked to 
ha V e
 their Research Departments participate in the investigation when-
ever <-nere was an indication that such collaboration would improve the 
cjUal . 
ty of a report. Although such a procedure would increase operating 
C

Proposed amendment to Regulation T (Item No. 2). There had 
been distributed a memorandum from the Legal Division dated July 12, 
1-967, relating to a request from the New York Stock Exchange that the 
Board amend section 220.4(g) of Regulation T (Credit by Brokers, 
Dealers, and Members of National Securities Exchanges) so as to permit 
m
°re than one creditor to join in financing a specialist's transactions 
w
ithout being subject to the margin requirements imposed by the regula-
tion. The present provision, adopted in 1949 at the request of the New 
Y o r
k Stock Exchange, permitted only a single creditor to do so. 
In view of the responsibility of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for activities of specialists under provisions of section 11 
o f
 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Stock Exchange proposal was 
Su
bmitted to the Commission for comment. While the Commission's staff 
a
greed that it might be advisable to broaden Regulation T to meet certain 
e
mergency needs, it took the position that conflicts of interest might 
r e
sult from broadening section 220.4(g) to the extent proposed by the 
St
°ck Exchange. 
Subsequent discussion between representatives of the Board, the 
Commission, and the Stock Exchange failed to result in complete agree-
m e n t
' Accordingly, for reasons set forth in the distributed memorandum, 
^ 
staff recommended that the Board (1) deny the request of the Stock 
E x c
hange as presented, but (2) amend section 220.4(g) of Regulation T 
s 0 
fc
hat several creditors might join in financing a specialist's trans-
acts 
°
ns
 if the appropriate committee of the New York Stock Exchange 

2999 
7/25/67 
-5-
determined that unusual market conditions necessitated the proposed 
arrangement. Attached to the memorandum were a draft of amendment and 
a proposed letter to the New York Stock Exchange. 
Miss Hart summarized the matter and suggested publication of 
the amendment in the Federal Register for comment in lieu of its immedi-
ate adopt ion, the reason being that even though the proposed amendment 
would be of a relaxing character its publication might elicit further 
suggestions from members of the industry, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, or other interested parties. 
Governor Daane inquired whether the amendment now being pro-
Posed had been discussed with representatives of the Commission and the 
Stock Exchange, and whether it would meet the need seen by the Stock 
Exchange. 
Miss Hart said there appeared to be agreement on all sides that 
would be desirable to broaden to some extent the current language of 
^
e
gulation T. At one point, however, the Stock Exchange officials 
S e
emed not to want any amendment unless it went as far as they had orig-
inally proposed. 
Governor Daane commented that, while the proposed amendment 
S e
emed to be based in no small measure on Commission views, the draft 
^
e
tter to the Stock Exchange did not so indicate. Miss Hart replied 
^ t it had been difficult to obtain an agreed view from the Commission, 
th 
e r
e having been some suggestion of opposition to the Stock Exchange 

3 0 f ' O 
7/25/67

Proposal because it seemed unnecessary and again because of the appear-
ance of potential conflicts of interest. Governor Daane suggested that 
the conflict of interest point might be brought out in the letter to the 
Stock Exchange, and Miss Hart agreed that that could be done. 
Unanimous approval was then given to a letter to the New York 
Stock Exchange in the form attached as Item No. 2, and it was understood 
that the proposed amendment would be published in the Federal Register 
comment. 
Guidelines for emergency situations (Item No. 3). Governor 
Maisel commented that the advice received of the closing of the Detroit 
B r
anch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago during the recent riots 
in Detroit raised in his mind the question whether adequate guidelines 
been established for the conduct of Reserve Bank operations in tem-
porary emergencies such as those resulting from riots, power failures, 
°
r
 natural disasters. His preliminary inquiry of the staff had not 
r e
vealed the existence of such guidelines. Interruptions to Federal 
Re 
S e
rve operations appeared to have been handled by ad hoc arrangements, 
^Pending on the particular circumstances, although there were of course 
Plans i n effect designed to deal with long-term disruptions caused by 
G
nemy 
a c t i o n > 
After discussion it was understood that Governor Maisel would 
*Plore the problem further with a view to determining whether the 
s t a
hlishment of general guidelines would be feasible and, if so, what 
they might take.

Dear Sir: 
It may be recalled that the Board's letter (S-2018) of 
May 26, 1967, regarding processing of merger and holding company 
applications did not refer specifically to the processing of 
reports on competitive factors to be submitted to other agencies. 
The statute, of course, permits only a limited time for the 
preparation of such reports. Nevertheless, the Board feels that 
to the extent feasible it can be helpful with respect to those 
reports to get the benefit of exchanges of views somewhat as in 
merger or holding company cases to be decided by the Board. 
Accordingly, if your Bank is not already following a 
procedure that enlists the services of research personnel with 
respect to competitive factor reports, it will be appreciated if 
a
Ppropriate implementing steps are taken. It may be, of course, 
that in many such cases initial staff discussions will indicate 
that the questions presented are not of sufficient difficulty to 
justify further collaboration on the report. 
Very truly yours, 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Assistant Secretary.

Mr. G. Keith Funston,

Dear Mr. Funston: 
This refers to your letter of October 5, 1965, and to sub-
sequent correspondence and conferences between staff of the Board, the 
N e
w York Stock Exchange, and the Securities and Exchange Conmission, in 
connection with a request by the Exchange that the Board amend section 
^0:4(g) of its Regulation T (Credit by Brokers, Dealers, and Members 
National Securities Exchanges) in order to permit more than one 
^editor to take part in a joint venture with a specialist, pursuant 
the provisions of that section, without being subject to the regula-
ion s margin requirements or to the restrictions imposed by section 
°-6(b) on joint adventures in which a creditor participates. 
The letter describes two situations in which it is felt the 
£ oposed broader authority would be helpful. One would be exemplified 
? the unusual occurrence several years ago involving COMSAT, where the 
^Pecialist was called on, without warning, in order to carry out his 
^ y to maintain a fair and orderly market, to take positions far in 
a s
c e s s
 of the risk which he, or a single creditor, should be asked to

a n
tial portion which the market cannot absorb immediately.

a
 request from the Exchange for adoption 
the provision that became section 220.4(g), it was stated that 
"The Board is, of course, interested in the orderly 
and efficient operation of securities markets. It 
is also concerned with the fact that rules of general 
application such as those relating to margin require-
ments should not provide special concessions for any 
individual or group unless such concessions are justified 
by appropriate considerations that are consistent with 
the general purpose of the regulation." 

Mr. G. Keith Funs ton

While your letter stated, and Exchange representatives have urged, 
that the proposed relaxation would assist the specialist to "perform 
his important functions more effectively", it does not appear that the 
n e
ed for additional methods of financing specialists arises very fre-
quently. Moreover, the commendable initiative which the exchanges have 
shown in recent years in developing new techniques for handling similar 
situations suggests that such a broadening of section 220.4(g) may be 
unnecessary. The imposition of special Exchange margin requirements 
°n trading in issues that show unusual activity, for example, has tended 
0
 reduce the likelihood of another "COMSAT episode" occurring. Methods 
°r disposing of large blocks of stock without serious disturbance, both 
°n and off the Exchange, have become more effective. In addition, it 
a
PPears that the feeling of obligation of a specialist to his co-venturers " 
^n such an account could perhaps interfere with his duty to maintain a 
air and orderly market in the security. 
In view of all these considerations, and the fact that the 
Resent provision permitting joint ventures between specialists and a 
^
l
ngl e creditor appears to be used only a few times each year, the Board 
to
GS n o t b e l i e v e 
i t :
 would be warranted in permitting several creditors 
join in financing a specialist in a joint venture to dispose of large 
iocks of stock on the Exchange. 
C o 
On the other hand, while situations such as that involving 
k MSAT do not occur frequently, and it is to be hoped that the imposing 
su
 
E x c h a n
S
e 
o f
 special, higher margin requirements before trading in 
c
h issues reaches a fever pitch will reduce the number of such situations 
the future, it seems advisable to prepare to cope with such situations,

 they occur infrequently. For this reason, the Board proposes 
C r°P
t i n

 to join in financing a specialist's transactions, in his own

Dear Mr. Swan: 
The Board believes that there may be a lesson to be 
learned from the interruptions to Federal Reserve services that 
have been caused in the last couple of years by power failures, 
natural disasters, and riots. While the interruptions so far 
experienced have been of short duration and have been satis-
factorily handled by ad hoc arrangements, it is possible that 
conditions might prevail where such arrangements would be 
inadequate. 
In other words, the Board is concerned that there 
^ y be a planning gap between ad hoc measures used to cope 
w
ith disruptions of short duration and the System's Emergency 
Plans designed to deal with long-term disruptions caused by 
enemy action. Accordingly, the Board believes that it would 
b
e desirable for the Presidents' Conference to look into this 
latter and make appropriate recommendations. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman
