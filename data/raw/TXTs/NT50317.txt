Department interposing no objection to the 
organization of Hambro American Bank and 
Trust Company, New York, New York. 
An application by International Bank of Detroit, Detroit, 
Michigan, to acquire approximately 10 per cent of the shares of 
Guaranty Trust Company of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was held 
over at the request of Governor Brimmer, who noted that at the time 
of the most recent examination the Edge corporation held a quantity 
of municipal bonds that did not conform with regulatory provisions. 
Management had indicated that the bonds would be sold as soon as that 
could be accomplished without substantial loss, and Governor Brimmer 

8/14/68 
-3-
felt that the pending application should not be acted upon until it 
had been ascertained whether the bonds had been sold. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller 
of the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of St. Clair Deposit 
Bank of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by Western Pennsylvania 
National Bank, also of Pittsburgh, was approved unanimously for 
transmittal to the Comptroller in a form in which the conclusion read 
as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed purchase of assets 
and assumption of liabilities of St. Clair Deposit Bank 
of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by Western 
Pennsylvania National Bank, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
would eliminate present and potential competition 
between the two institutions. The proposed trans-
action would further the trend toward concentration 
of banking resources in a few large banks in the 
Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area and the trend toward the 
elimination of smaller banks through merger or similar 
transaction. The overall effect on competition would 
be adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
Purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of State Bank of 
Chowchilla, Chowchilla, California, by San Joaquin Valley National 
Bank, Tulare, California, was approved unanimously for transmittal to 
the Comptroller of the Currency. The conclusion stated that the 
transaction would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Otto Bremer Foundation. The Board authorized issuance of an 
order and statement reflecting its approval on July 25, 1968, of the 

3131 
8/14/68

application of Otto Bremer Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota to 
acquire additional shares of American National Bank and Trust 
Company, also of St. Paul. Copies of the documents, as issued, 
are attached under Item No. 4. 
Branch question. A memorandum from the Legal Division 
dated August 9, 1968, discussed the proposal of Seattle Trust and 
Savings Bank, Seattle, Washington, to establish a limited-service 
facility near its existing branch in the Crossroads Shopping Center, 
Bellevue, Washington. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 
acting under delegated authority, had approved the establishment 
°f the facility, as a branch, in April 1968 on the assumption that 
the site was located in an unincorporated area of King County. How-
ever, when another Seattle bank protested, it was learned that the 
shopping center had become part of the city of Bellevue. The Reserve 
Bank then rescinded its approval, since Washington State banking law 
does not permit the establishment of out-of-town branches in any city 
0 r
 town in which a bank regularly transacts business except through 
the acquisition of an existing bank or branch. 
The questions before the Board thus were whether the proposed 
facility would constitute a branch within the meaning of section 
5155(f) of the U.S. Revised Statutes and, if so, whether the Board 
w
as authorized to approve its establishment under paragraph 3 of 
section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, which permits State member 

8/14/68 
-5-
banks, with the approval of the Board, to establish branches on the 
same terms and conditions, and subject to the limitations and 
restrictions, as are applicable to national banks. 
(National banks, 
with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, are permitted 
to establish out-of-town branches only if such establishment is 
authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question 
by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and 
not merely by implication or recognition.) 
On the first question the Legal Division, drawing on rulings 
made in the past in the light of the Board's reading of the statute, 
concluded that the proposed facility would be a branch. On the 
second question the Division concluded that the Board was precluded 
from approving the establishment of the branch. 
In discussion of the matter there appeared to be general 
agreement that the Legal Division had analyzed the situation correctly 
against the background of the Board's position of long standing, and 
some members of the Board indicated that they would be content to 
dispose of the matter on that basis. Others, however, were not so 
disposed. One member (Governor Mitchell) expressed the view that 
continued adherence to the Board's long-standing position was tending 
to thwart banks in efforts to modernize their services and thereby 
better to meet the needs and convenience of the public. He suggested 
that in this case, for example, the Board might interpret the facts 
in such manner as to determine the proposed operation to be a 

3133 
8/14/68 
-6-
facility, which it was understood did not require the approval of 
the Washington State banking authorities. Another member (Governor 
Sherrill) referred to several factors in the present case that he 
thought, if reexamined, might lead to a justifiable conclusion that 
the proposed operation need not be regarded as an additional branch 
but instead might more realistically be construed as a facility or 
even an extension of the present branch. 
Another member (Governor Maisel) introduced a line of rea-
soning in which he suggested increased reliance by the Board on 
interpretation of the laws of the respective States. 
In this case, 
for instance, he felt that it would be helpful to have a State 
court decision interpreting the rather ambiguous statutes of the 
State of Washington, and that the Board should then be guided accord-
ingly. Other members, however, indicated that they would not be 
inclined toward such a policy, since they believed it was incumbent 
on the Board, in discharging its responsibilities, to reach its best 
judgment based on a reading of the applicable Federal statutes. 
Governor Robertson then observed that this was an area in 
which difficult questions frequently had arisen and that it might 
be worthwhile to reexamine the question of what constitutes a branch 
in the light of the pertinent Federal statutes. Such a study, he 
suggested, should appropriately be conducted by the three Federal 
bank supervisory agencies, through the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Bank Regulation, in order to try to establish a uniform 

A 
o x 
8/14/68 
-7-
position, and the study would obviously require some time. He 
proposed, therefore, that the pending application be held in abey-
ance pending the completion of such a study, with the understanding 
that if the applicant bank pressed for an answer on its application 
it would be advised that, although the broad question of the defi-
nition of a branch for purposes of the Federal statutes was under 
review, the Board presently would be required to deny the application. 
After further discussion it was agreed to proceed in the 
manner outlined by Governor Robertson. 
Over-the-counter securities. Recently enacted legislation 
(Public Law 90-437) had authorized the Board to apply margin require-
ments to credit extended for the purpose of purchasing or carrying 
stocks not listed on national securities exchanges (over-the-counter 
securities). Problems involved in implementing the legislation, 
along with recommendations, were presented in a staff memorandum 
dated August 9, 1968. 
As described in the memorandum, and in comments by 
Mr. Partee and other staff members at this meeting, the first main 
problem related to the development of a so-called margin list of 
over-the-counter securities. 
Inclusion on such list would mean that 
banks would only be able to extend credit for the purchasing or 
carrying of the stock subject to margin requirements, but that 
brokers, presently prohibited from lending at all on the collateral 
of over-the-counter securities, would be able to extend credit on 

3:135 
8/14/68 
-8-
such collateral subject to margin rules. One possible approach 
that had been considered was to establish two margin lists, one 
for brokers and the other for banks. However, for administrative 
reasons and in light of the legislative history, that possibility 
had been discarded. Accordingly, the staff now recommended that 
the selection standards for inclusion on the initial margin list 
be market oriented, as reflected by broad investor interest, market 
depth as indicated by significant trading volume, meaningful con-
tinuous price quotations, adequacy of statistical information, 
reasonable size and permanence of companies, and market seasoning. 
Information believed to be pertinent in establishing that a stock 
possessed such characteristics was also set forth. 
It was estimated that about 200 stocks might qualify for 
inclusion on the margin list initially through the use of such 
standards. To obtain information available only from corporate 
records and to verify other information, it was the staff recom-
mendation that a questionnaire be sent to those firms disclosing 
financial and other information pursuant to the Securities Acts 
Amendments of 1964 (section 12(g)) that had stocks on the national 
daily list of the National Association of Securities Dealers for 
which six or more dealers had made markets in 20 out of the most 
recent 26 weeks. 

O , * 
« > P 
8/14/68 
-9-
It was contemplated that the initial margin list might be 
reviewed every six months for additions and deletions, and tentative 
deletion standards were proposed. 
The memorandum also noted that the functioning of over-the-
counter markets depended critically on the behavior of individual 
broker/dealers who chose to "make a market" in selected stocks and 
that the positions carried by such broker/dealers were largely 
financed by bank loans. It was proposed, therefore, that certified 
market-makers be exempted from margin regulation on loans against 
inventory positions in the over-the-counter margin list stocks in 
which they made a market. This raised questions with respect to 
the criteria that would be used to determine which market-makers 
were entitled to the exemption and with respect to the administration 
of the exemption. For reasons identified in the memorandum, the staff 
recommended that the market-makers be designated under standards 
agreed upon by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board, 
and that administration of the market-maker exemption be vested in 
the Commission, at least until such time as the National Association 
of Securities Dealers had further developed its facilities. 
Surveil-
lance of the certified market-makers would be handled primarily by 
the Commission, while surveillance of the over-the-counter margin 
list would be the responsibility of the Board's staff. 
Comments by members of the Board during a discussion of the 
matter were generally favorable to the staff proposals. 
It was 

o 
8/14/68 
-10-
recognized that this was an area in which neither the Board nor 
the staff were at this stage particularly knowledgeable and that 
experimentation would be necessary. 
In the circumstances, the 
staff was complimented for having devised a regulatory scheme 
that seemed satisfactory for the initial stages and yet one suf-
ficiently flexible to permit adjustments to be made as experience 
might dictate. 
The principal reservation was expressed by Governor Maisel, 
who inquired whether it had not been an intent of the legislation 
to restrict the extension of bank credit for the purchasing and 
carrying of stocks traded over the counter that might be of doubt-
ful intrinsic value. If so, he pointed out, the standards suggested 
for inclusion on the margin list would leave a gap in the area that 
had been of concern. 
Other members of the Board supported the staff view that 
the primary objective of the legislation, as expressed in Congres-
sional testimony and otherwise, had been to regulate the total 
volume of credit extended for the purchasing or carrying of over-
the-counter securities. Their comments did not rule out the 
possibility, however, that in due course it might be deemed advis-
able to adjust the standards for inclusion in the margin list and 
make that list more extensive. 
Governor Brimmer, supported to a certain extent by other 
members of the Board, expressed some disappointment that no 

8/14/68 
-11-
mechanism appeared to have been put in place for obtaining infor-
mation with regard to a broader spectrum of firms whose securities 
were traded over the counter, including insurance companies. A 
suggestion was made that something might be done toward that end by 
expanding the proposed survey questionnaire, but the staff pointed 
out that such a move would not in itself provide a complete answer. 
It was understood that the staff would give the problem further 
study. 
As to the question of the placement of responsibility for 
administration of the proposed exemption for market-makers, members 
of the Board agreed that it would appear advisable to accept the 
offer of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the under-
standing, however, that appreciation would be expressed to the 
National Association of Securities Dealers for its interest and 
cooperation and that at a later time the matter might be reviewed 
in the light of developments and a transfer of the responsibility 
to the Association given further consideration. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that 
the staff would proceed generally along the lines indicated in its 
memorandum, that the proposed questionnaire would be sent to appro-
priate firms after Budget Bureau approval had been obtained, and 
that the further steps to be taken in constructing the regulatory 
framework would then be considered by the Board.

(Note: One of the attachments to the staff memorandum 
referred to the increased workload that would devolve upon the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation and proposed the establish-
ment of two new professional positions at Grade FR-13, one in 
replacement of a person borrowed from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. No discussion was directed specifically to this 
aspect of the matter at today's meeting, but by the same token 
no objection was interposed.) 
Patman questionnaire. By letters dated July 9, 1968, 
addressed individually to members of the Board and Reserve Bank 
Presidents, Congressman Patman, as Chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Domestic Finance of the House Banking and Currency Committee, 
requested views on questions related to monetary policy guidelines 
and open market operations, the structure of the Federal Reserve, 
and recent monetary developments. The views were sought in pre-
paration for hearings planned to be held later this year on H.R. 11, 
a bill "To make the Federal Reserve System responsive to the best 
interests of the people of the United States and to improve the 
It-* { 
• . . 
- 
, - • j 
:• •» •; 
' 
. 
coordination of monetary, fiscal, and economic policy." 
In a memorandum dated August 5, 1968, Mr. Brill advised 
that replies to the several questions had been drafted by members 
°f the Board's staff and a task force from the Federal Reserve Banks, 
with alternative drafts in a few cases. The replies, which leaned 

3140 
8/14/68 
-13-
heavily on earlier analyses and positions taken in response to Con-
- j 
I 
gressional inquiries, testimony before Congressional committees, 
and the Board's annual reports, had been reviewed by a subcom-
mittee of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
consisting of Messrs. Treiber, Bopp, and Coldwell. The subcommittee 
had chosen among alternative drafts and had made various suggestions 
regarding the replies to the questions, for the most part of an 
editorial nature, with the result that the proposed package of 
replies was now in the form attached to the August 5 memorandum. 
The subcommittee had also proposed that consideration be 
give n to a unified submission on behalf of the Board members and 
Presidents, and Mr. Treiber had prepared a draft of transmittal 
letter to Congressman Patman. Copies of the draft letter were 
distributed. 
Discussion revealed that the Board members were disposed to 
favor the idea of submitting a unified reply. However, it was felt 
that the transmittal letter drafted by Mr. Treiber should be reworked 
to emphasize that although the answers reflected views generally 
held by members of the Board and the Presidents, individuals might 
have different shadings of view and emphasis on some points. 
As to the answers themselves, some Board members made sug-
gestions at this meeting for modifications at various places, 
including a general suggestion by Governor Brimmer that references 

1 1 1 
u i ' L X 
8/14/68 
-14-
to statements submitted by the Federal Reserve in response to 
somewhat similar questions in connection with hearings held in 
1952 be deemphasized. One Board member indicated that his sug-
gestions were being transmitted direct to the staff, while another 
indicated that he would forward any suggestions as soon as he had 
had an opportunity to review the answers more thoroughly. 
It was then understood that Mr. Brill would advise 
Mr. Trieber that there would be no objection to sending the draft 
answers to the Presidents for comment, that at the same time the 
Board's staff would take under consideration the suggestions sub-
fitted by Board members, and that the Board was favorable to the 
idea of sending a unified reply to Congressman Patman and the text 
. <., 
°f the transmittal letter would be discussed in the light of the 
Board's comments at today's meeting. 
Request from Senator Proxmire. In a letter to Chairman 
Martin dated July 30, 1968, Senator Proxmire, Chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee, had asked that the Board, within two weeks after 
the end of any calendar quarter in which the money supply changed 
ky an amount less than 2 per cent or more than 6 per cent (annual 
r a t
e ) , submit a report explaining the reasons for the departure 
from the indicated range. The Senator also requested periodic 
r e
ports on the reasons for actions taken during periods when changes 
the money supply were within the indicated range, and he invited 

314 
8/14/68 
-15-
suggestions as to which definition of the money supply the Board 
would find most useful for this purpose. 
In a memorandum dated August 13, 1968, Mr. Brill examined 
some technical issues involved in measuring change and some of the 
conceptual issues involved in defining the appropriate monetary 
variable for the purpose of reporting to the Congress. He then 
suggested an alternative approach, as described in an attached 
draft of letter to Senator Proxmire, that contemplated a more reg-
ular reporting of monetary and financial developments than would 
be involved in reporting only when there were substantial fluctua-
tions in a certain category of financial transactions. Under the 
Proposal the Board's staff would prepare, for transmittal to the 
Committee about one month after the close of each quarter, reports 
°f financial developments including an analysis of changes in the 
money supply, narrowly defined, as well as of changes in the 
broader definition that included all types of deposits. 
Such 
changes would be interpreted in the context of changes occurring 
in other financial flows and interest rate developments in financial 
markets. 
Board members appeared to be attracted to a procedure along 
the l i n e s 
suggested by Mr. Brill. A number of changes in the 
Proposed letter to Senator Proxmire were proposed, and it was 
U r u J
erstood that the matter would be taken up again by the Board 

3143 
8/14/68 
-16-
after these suggestions and other comments had been considered by 
the staff. 
In this connection, Governor Brimmer suggested that before 
the subject came up again the staff also give consideration to a 
possible approach under which the reports to the Committee would 
be made about 60 days after the end of each quarter, the schedule 
for release of the policy record entries of the Federal Open Market 
Committee would be shortened to 60 days after the date of each 
Committee meeting, and the entries would be used as a basis for 
reporting to the Committee on monetary developments. 
Foreign credit restraint program. A memorandum from 
Governor Brimmer dated August 13, 1968, submitted a draft of a 
proposed press release relating to performance under the foreign 
credit restraint program during the first half of 1968. The 
Treasury Department was expected to hold a press conference in 
connection with the release by the Commerce Department of balance 
of payments results for the second quarter, and Governor Brimmer 
proposed to have the Board statement available for release simul-
taneously with the Treasury and Commerce releases. 
After certain editorial-type changes had been suggested, 
the release of the proposed statement in a final form satisfactory 
to Governor Brimmer was authorized. A copy of the release, as 
subsequently issued, is attached as Item No. 5. 

8/14/68 
-17-
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Discount rate. There was a preliminary discussion with 
regard to possible action on the Federal Reserve discount rate. 
As of today there were no proposals before the Board for a change 
in the rate, but there was some indication that the directors of 
one or more of the Reserve Banks might act tomorrow to reduce the 
rate, subject to approval-by the Board of Governors. 
Part of the discussion at today's meeting had to do with 
the prospective availability of Board members over the next several 
days, and certain members who were planning to be away from their 
offices indicated that they would return for meetings as the 
» 
situation might require. 
One member (Governor Mitchell) who was leaving today on 
vacation said that if it seemed desirable to the other members to 
change the rate at this time he would prefer a one-quarter percent-
age point cut only, since he believed that such action would satisfy 
all pragmatic considerations. 
On the merits, he did not feel that 
any action was indicated, given the situation as of today. The 
situation could, of course, change at almost any time, even to such 
an extent as to warrant a half-point reduction. 
If necessary, he 
could return from vacation for consideration of the matter, but if 
he did return he felt quite certain that he would argue for a cut 

8/14/68 
-18-
in the rate of no more than one-quarter point unless conditions 
had by that time changed significantly. 
Governor Mitchell then withdrew from the meeting. 
There followed a brief review of money market developments 
and related matters during which several members of the Board 
expressed a 
tentative view that any proposals for a discount rate 
reduction that might be received from Reserve Banks tomorrow 
should receive prompt concideration. 
It was then agreed that the Board would meet at 4:00 p.m. 
tomorrow if any proposals for a change in the rate had been 
received by that time.

Federal Executive Institute. After discussion of interest 
that had been expressed by the Chairman of the Civil Service Com-
mission to Chairman Martin in having the Federal Reserve represented 
in one of the eight-week high-level courses for Government execu-
tives being offered by the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, during the coming year, Governor Sherrill was 
j*nthori7.prl to select an appropriate member of the Board's staff 
enrollment. This action was understood to constitute authori-
2 a
tion of payment to the Civil Service Commission of the cost of 
e
nrollment ($2,950) and also approval of any resultant overexpendi-
ture in the pertinent account of the 1968 budget. 
(Note:

Governor Sherrill subsequently decided on nomination of Charles 
C. Walcutt, Assistant Director, Division of Federal Reserve Bank 
Operations, to attend the session to be held during the period 
from October 14 to December 6, 1968.) 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of July 22, 1968,

 otherwise indicated, all banking data noted are as of this 

the Jacob Schmidt Company, a personal holding company, because of 
Provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act requiring divestiture of any 
stock representing more than 5 per cent of any nonbanking entity. 
Applicant proposes to exchange its stock in the Jacob Schmidt Company

 shares of stock representing 11.63 per cent interest in Bank which 
a r e o w

A
PPlicant's ownership of Bank from 1.26 per cent to 12.89 per cent. 
Control of Bank, however, would remain with the Jacob Schmidt Company

 would retain a 69.86 per cent interest in Bank. 
Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As

Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
C [ t
 the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
°Poly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
Polize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
the United States, Nor may the Board approve a proposed acqui-

n
 the effect of which, in any section of the country, may be sub-
stantial i V to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or 
^hich in Q
ny other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the 
Board fi n d 
Q
s that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction 
°re cle a ri y
 outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of 

the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community 
to be served. In each case the Board is required to take into consider-
a
tion the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of 
e
 bank holding company and the banks concerned and the convenience 
<1-j 
needs of the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - Bank is the

 iargest bank in St. Paul and the fourth largest bank in the

indirectly 16 of the 723 commercial banks in llinnesota having 2.3 per

U t u
 to Bank is the Drovers State Bank (deposits of $20 million),

 ed in South St. Paul. No significant competition exists between 
banks. 
Since consummation of the proposal would not result in

C a n t 
a c c

effect upon the ejiisting concentration of banking resources under

Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
Applicant's financial condition and that of its subsidiary banks are

Bank's financial condition is sound, its management capable

actors will not be affected by the present proposal. 
Considerations

Convenience and needs of the community involved. - Consummation 
proposal would not affect the extent to x;hich Bank presently serves 
convenience and needs of its service area, nor that of customers in

^ I j M M E D I A T E RELEASE 
August 16, 1968. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
n n
9Unced today that U.S. commercial banks reduced their holdings of 
°
re
Ji$n assets under the Board's voluntary foreign credit restraint 
r o
&tam by about $650 million during the first half of 1968. This 
dec1i n 
compares with a 
reduction of $20 million recorded during 
e 
f
irst half of 1967, and substantially exceeds the objective of 
m i
H i o n reduction for the entire year which was announced when 
6 V i S e d
 Sidelines were issued on January 1, 1968. 
At the end of 1967, the commercial banks were below the guide-
n e 
c
e i l i n g then effective by $225 million. During the first six 
m
°nth8 of thi 
•
 c n i f i
 year, the ceiling itself was reduced by $200 million 
b e
cause of repayments of credits outstanding to developed countries of 
Contin 
n
 al Western Europe. 
This reduction, together with the decline 
in holdi 
n
8s of foreign assets described above, left the banks $675 
0 n
 below the suggested ceiling on June 30, 1968. The ceiling 
v U l 
b e 
reduced further during the remainder of the year by additional 
8
 of credits outstanding to continental Western Europe. 
Th 
Board said that the exemption of Canada from the balance 
o f
 Payments urograms has not resulted in an outflow of bank capital 
onntry, o n the contrary, reporting banks have reduced their 
c l
aims on Ca

^Aiings announced on January 1, 1968, although the substantially 
S s
ened availability of credit in the United States during the first 
half of th 
n e
 year may also have been a contributing factor. 

On other aspects of the program, the Board said: 
-- The guidelines issued on January 1, 1968, requested that 
banks make no new long-term credits to developed countries of conti-
nental Western Europe (except to finance U.S. exports) and that their 
ceilings be reduced during the year by the amount of the repayment of 
such credits. 
In addition, the banks were requested to reduce the 
amount of short-term credits outstanding to developed countries of 
continental Western Europe on December 31, 1967, together with their 
ceilings, by 40 per cent during the year at a rate of 10 per cent per 
calendar quarter. 
These provisions, which were designed to insure that the impact 
the program was focused mainly on those countries where the counter-
p a r t
 
the U.S. balance of payments deficit is found, reduced the 
h
anks' ceiling by $230 million during the first half of 19b8, $120 million 
uhich was related to the repayment of long-term credits. The provision 
relating to short-term credits suggested a reduction in such credits 
outstanding (and the ceiling) by $110 million during the first half of 
the outstanding amount of these credits held by the reporting 
b
*nka actually was reduced by $116 million. 

-A-
* > 
u 1 
-- One difficulty with a program that is based upon a 
specific point in time is that it bears inequitably upon banks that 
bad small, or no base date holdings of foreign assets. 
In an effort 
t o a l l e
v i a t e this inequity, reporting banks whose holdings of foreign 
8
?ets were less than 2 per cent of their total assets as of December 31, 
1 9 6 6
'
 W e r e
 permitted by the guidelines issued on January 1, 1968, to 
Sfjijplate their ceilings as their 1967 ceiling plus one-third of the 
inference between that amount and 2 per cent of their December 31, 1966, 
o t a
l assets. The guidelines also contained provisions for special 
C e 
l
*ng s, under certain limited conditions, for those banks that had 
n o t
p r e v i o u s l y been involved in foreign lending. 
.The net result of these provisions increased the aggregate 
i U n 8 S 
o f 
t h e
 banks that took advantage of the alternative computation 
t h e 
s
P
e
cial ceilings by about $335 million as compared with a 
I l i
n g for those banks calculated at 103 per cent of their base date 
l d i n
8 8 . 
As of June 30, 1968, these banks had used only $80 million 
t h i
8 additional leeway. Further, the foreign claims reported by 
these ba ir 
k s 
o n 
J u
n e 30 were actually $25 million below their aggregate 
cei 
fin 
i n
8 for 19b7, while their holdings of priority credits--credits to 
ance U s 
• • exports or to meet the needs of developing countries--
bad i n creased by $53 million since October 31, 1967. 

-5-
3 1 . 6 1 
-- The guidelines provide that banks may exempt from the 
• 
V 
ceiling any loan guaranteed or participated in by the Export-Import 
B a
nk of the United States. The banks reported $340 million of such 
loa 
a n s 
o n
 June 30, 1968, a figure which has not varied greatly during 
t h
e past year. 
-- To reinforce the foreign credit restraint program the Board 
\ :i 
a
nnounced on February 8, 1968, that it henceforth would not approve 
e q u i t
V investments by banks and their subsidiaries, the so-called "Edge" 
vv.V'v..' 
ari
d Agreement" corporations, in developed countries of continental 
VJegtp 
G r n
 Europe unless it could be clearly demonstrated that the invest-
••I 
^ould not be detrimental to the U.S. balance of payments. 
Since 
date the Board has approved equity investments in that area totaling 
i 
a. 
, '•"Out 
4 1 1 • 
vo million, only one-quarter of the amount invested during the 
U r s
t half of 1967. 
Governor Brimmer said that he was happy to add his appreciation 
' "I -

to thaf voiced in the past by Vice Chairman Robertson, his predecessor 
in adm-i mstering the program, for the spirit of cooperation exhibited 
financial institutions in connection with this important program.
