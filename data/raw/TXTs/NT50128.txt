Application of Southeast Bancorporation. There had been 
distributed, principally under date of August 3, 1967, memoranda from 
the Division of Examinations and other pertinent papers regarding the 
aPplication of Southeast Bancorporation, Inc., Miami, Florida, to 
become a bank holding company through acquisition of a majority of the 
shares of The First National Bank of Miami, Coral Way National Bank, 
Miami, (successor to the defunct Five Points National Bank), and 
Curtiss National Bank of Miami Springs. 
Acquisition of all of the voting shares (except for directors' 
^alifying shares) of First National Bank of Miami and Coral Way 
National Bank (presently owned by First National through an intermedi-
ary) would be accomplished through an exchange of stock involving no 
Premium. The applicant proposed to purchase 80 per cent or more of the 
Voting stock of Curtiss National Bank, 76.2 per cent of which would be 

3188 
8/14/67 
-4-
purchased from Mr. Harry H. Brodie for $1,725,000 in cash (approxi-
mately $36 a share) representing a premium of approximately 8.7 per 
cent based on Curtiss National's deposits. The same $36 a share offer 
would be made to all minority shareholders. 
Of the $1,725,000 to be paid Mr. Brodie, $1,025,000 would be 
applied against a loan made to Mr. Brodie by First National Bank of 
Miami. The sum of $500,000 would be placed in escrow to purchase 
listed assets of Curtiss National Bank of doubtful quality, and $200,000 
would be held to indemnify against unrecorded claims and potential lia-
bilities. Applicant also proposed to inject as much as $1,500,000 of 
additional capital funds into Curtiss National Bank. That bank's capi-
tal position was reported to be serious. 
The Division of Examinations noted that First National Bank of 
Miami was the largest bank in Florida and held about 27 per cent of the 
total deposits of the banks in Dade County, its primary service area. 
Such area completely encompassed the primary service area of each of 
the other two proposed subsidiary banks of the holding company system. 
Th ' 
xs concentration was an adverse competitive factor bearing on the 
Proposal. However, Curtiss National Bank appeared to be in imminent 
danger of insolvency, and the proposed acquisition would serve to 
insure the bank's future as a viable institution. 
The Comptroller of the Currency recommended approval of the 
aPplication, as did the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, both recom-
mendations being premised on the view that an emergency condition 

3 1 . 8 9 
8/14/67 
-5-
existed at Curtiss National, that an increase in the bank's capital 
was imperative, and that there was no reasonable alternative to the 
proposal made by the applicant. 
The Division of Examinations concluded that while anticompeti-
tive elements existed in the proposal, the grave financial and manage-
rial difficulties of Curtiss National, together with the apparent lack 
°f other alternatives, made approval of the proposal consistent with 
the public interest. The Banking Markets Section concurred in the 
division's favorable recommendation. 
A 
J

At today's meeting Mr. Lyon reviewed the principal elements of 
the application, following which Mr. Solomon noted that an intensive 
analysis of the competitive factors had not been made. In that regard 
the staff had simply assumed the worst, so to speak, and then gone on 
t o analysis of the banking factors. If the Board was inclined not to 
ag*"ee with the Division's recommendation on the application, then a 
ore complete study of the competitive situation should perhaps be made. 
Als°> the Board might want to hear the Comptroller of the Currency and 
Representatives of the applicant. 
In response to a question from Governor Mitchell as to other 
Possible purchasers of Curtiss National, Mr. Lyon said that replies to 
a Questionnaire submitted by the Atlanta Reserve Bank to 26 commercial 
banks revealed no interest on the part of 23 banks. Two had indicated 
Possible interest if the price was "right", and the other reply was 

3 1 9 0 
8/14/67 
-6-
from interests identified with United Bancshares of Florida, Inc., 
Miami Beach, whose representatives had appeared before the Board to 
present their views on August 9, 1967. 
(A transcript of that meeting 
had been distributed to the Board, as had a memorandum dated August 11, 
1967, from the Division of Examinations in which it was noted that the 
debt-to-net worth ratio of Bancshares (52.02 per cent) had been a 
source of concern at the time the formation of the holding company was 
approved in 1966. Should Bancshares be interested in acquiring Curtiss 
National, the price paid plus injection of the necessary additional 
capital would increase the ratio substantially further.) 
Governor Maisel discussed, on several bases of calculation, the 
premium applicant proposed to pay for stock of Curtiss National and 
inquired about precedents. 
It was understood that the staff would review the files and 
Prepare information on that point. 
Governor Brimmer asked whether, in the judgment of the Legal 
division, other factors sufficiently counterbalanced the anticompeti-
tive effects of the proposal as to warrant approval under the language 
o f the law. Mr. O'Connell replied in the affirmative, adding, in 
response to a further question from Governor Brimmer, that he believed 
the Board's statement, in event of approval, could justifiably go quite 
f a r in citing the condition of Curtiss National Bank and indicating 
tllat the condition of the bank was the primary reason for approval of 
t h e applicatiorit 

3191 
8/14/67

Governor Robertson then outlined his views on the application, 
noting fi rst that First National Bank was not only the dominant but the 
dominating bank in the area. A previous effort to achieve holding com-
pany status through affiliation with large banks in Jacksonville, Tampa, 
and Orlando (all among the ten largest banks in Florida) had been denied 
by the Board in 1962 despite a favorable recommendation by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta and an indication of no objection by the Comp-
troller. Subsequently, however, First National Bank, through an inter-
mediary company, took over the Five Points National Bank (which became 
the Coral Way National Bank) in what he (Governor Robertson) considered 
a n illegal fashion. This was a step toward a holding company system, 
but in order formally to establish a bank holding company First National 
Bank still needed to acquire another bank. Now a good opportunity had 
come along, not only to clear up the question of legality of the Coral 
W ay transaction but also to establish a bank holding company. Conse-
quently, although First National Bank at first refused to extend credit 
to Mr. Brodie, when the proposed sale of Curtiss National Bank to 
an°ther group fell through, First National came forward with a loan of 
>1,725 ,000 to Mr. Brodie and put its own operating personnel into the 
bank i n April. Any deterioration in the bank's condition since that 
time presumably could not be attributed to the former management. 
Nevertheless, the bank was reported by the Comptroller to be near 
insolvency. 

8 1 9 2 
8/14/67 
-8-
If such was the case, Governor Robertson continued, the bank's 
stock would be worth little. The Comptroller had said that hasty 
action was needed to save the bank because it required capital and 
other strengthening. Even in that situation, however, First National 
was willing to come to the rescue by paying $1,725,000 for the Brodie 
stock. An almost unbelievable premium was being offered and, in addi-
tion, First National was willing to contribute $1,500,000 in capital. 
This afforded evidence of the value of the bank from First National's 
Point of view. 
As Governor Robertson saw it, there was practically no possi-
bility that Curtiss National Bank would close in the near future. First 
National already had a substantial investment in the bank, and it was 
n°t likely to pull out management. Neither was it likely that in the 
circumstances Curtiss National Bank would be liquidated by its share-
holders. 
Governor Robertson pointed out that Curtiss National Bank had 
*Dout $20 million of deposits, that its deposits had increased substan-
tially last year, and that its earnings record was good except for 
losses sustained. It was in an excellent location from every competi-
j 
V e point of view. Capital admittedly was needed, but the potential 
§r°V7th of the bank was such that it appeared that it should be possible 
to f 
*ind some willing purchaser who would provide the required capital. 
Governor Robertson concluded by saying that in view of the 
bviously adverse effect on competition he could not approve the pending 

3 1 9 8 
8/14/67 
-9-
application without much more evidence than presently contained in the 
file that the Curtiss National Bank problem could not be worked out in 
another way. He would not vote against the application, but he would 
vote not to approve it until both the Comptroller of the Currency and 
representatives of First National Bank had come before the Board and 
established that this was the only way in which the problem could be 
resolved. 
Governor Brimmer inquired whether the possibility of postponing 
a decision and asking for a more complete hearing had been explored, 
and Mr. O'Connell replied that if it had developed that the Board was 
inclined to approve the application there would be no need for such 
steps to be taken. On the other hand, the staff felt that if the 
Board's discussion pointed toward denial of the application, due pro-
cess would seem to require at least that the applicant be given an 
opportunity to rebut the testimony on anticompetitive effects that had 
been presented by representatives of United Bancshares. Also, since 
the Comptroller had advised that there was no reasonable alternative to 
the current proposal, perhaps the Board would want to meet with the 
Comptroller. 
Governor Mitchell noted that it appeared obvious that the case 
could not be disposed of today. He did not feel that the anticompeti-
tive aspects of the proposal were as strong as some had suggested, but 
a t this juncture he was not ready to cast a vote. 

8 1 9 4 
8/14/67

Goverrior Maisel also indicated that he was not ready to vote 
at this time. The staff, he said, had not answered to his satisfaction 
several questions that were on his mind. In his judgment, this case 
raised major policy issues bearing upon the public interest, including 
those involved in the size of the premium being offered, and he would 
like to have them analyzed further. 
Governor Brimmer suggested that there appeared to be two issues 
involved, the first relating to the need for rescuing Curtiss National 
Bank and the second having to do with expansion of First National Bank 
through the holding company device. He agreed that it would be desir-
able to obtain additional information, through a hearing if necessary, 
before reaching a decision. 
Governor Robertson then suggested that the staff check with the 
Comptroller of the Currency to make sure that Curtiss National Bank was 
not in danger of closing immediately and to determine whether the Comp-
troller would like to appear before the Board in support of his position 
that the current proposal represented the only way in which the problem 
°f Curtiss National Bank could be worked out. The staff could also 
wake arrangements for other parties, including representatives of First 
National Bank, and perhaps Mr. Brodie, to appear before the Board in 
a n effort to obtain information bearing on that question. In the mean-
time, members of the Board could present to the staff any other ques-
tions on which they felt additional information should be obtained,

either through staff analysis or at the time other parties appeared 
before the Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.

> * • 
— 
As part of this Division's program of continuing improvement, as 
as the determination to build an organization which is demonstrably 
Capable and willing in performance and response, the following organizational 
changes were made effective August 3, 1967: 
1. The Applications Programming Unit of the Computer Systems 
and Programming Section has been transferred to the 
Applications Analysis Section, leaving only the Systems 
Unit in the former. 
2. The Applications Analysis Section (see attached chart) has 
been renamed the Analysis and Programming Section. 
3. The Computer Systems and Programming Section has been re-
designated as the Systems Suport Section. 
'j :•«<.*• -j J " l 
4. The Equipment Operations and Production Control Section 
remains unchanged, organizationally, but has been renamed 
the Operations Section. 
5. The three sections--Analysis and Programming, headed by 
^ 
Mr. Hadley Nelson; Systems Support, headed by Miss Joyce 
Brueckel; and Operations, headed by Mr. Richard Williams--
together currently represent all of the direct coraputer-
oriented support in this Division. The three sections 
continue to be headed by an Assistant Director, Mr. John 
Rhinehart, and collectively are referred to as ADP 
Applications.

system support to all computer users through the System 
Support Section.
