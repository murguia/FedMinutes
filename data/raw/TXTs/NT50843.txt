Gold loans to Colombia. There had been distributed a memorandum 
dated October 30, 1967, from Mr. Solomon relating to a request from 
Senator Morse, Chairman of the Subcommittee on American Republics 
Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for information con-
cerning Federal Reserve System loans to Colombia since 1961. The Sub-
committee was conducting an investigation of AID lending in Colombia, 
and it was understood that the results of the study would be published. 
Attached to the memorandum was a proposed reply that would 
include a review of the eight gold collateral loans that the System 

t , ,, 
1173 
10/31/67 
-3-
had extended to the central bank of Colombia during the specified period. 
The draft letter would indicate that while it was public knowledge that 
the Colombian central bank had borrowed from the Federal Reserve System, 
it might not be generally realized that the loans were secured by gold; 
therefore, public disclosure could have repercussions both on the Colom-
bian political scene and in terms of central bank relationships. The 
letter would urge that this and other information relative to the nego-
tiations with the Colombian central bank be treated as information for 
the exclusive use of the Subcommittee. As an additional safeguard, the 
memorandum mentioned that the Board might wish to suggest to the Subcom-
mittee that, if it did decide to publish this information, it give the 
Colombian authorities a chance to comment, prior to publication, on such 
portions of the Subcommittee study as dealt with the gold loans. 
Governor Brimmer indicated that he was uncomfortable about the 
thought of furnishing information of this kind that might well be pub-
lished. He inquired whether publication of the information might be 
embarrassing to the State Department. 
Mr. Maroni replied that the State Department was prepared, if 
necessary, to see the information in print; the only possible embarrass-
ment, if the fact that the loans were secured by gold was revealed, would 
be to the Colombian authorities. 
Governor Brimmer then expressed concern about the implications 
of publication of such information in terms of System relationships 

4174 
10/31/67 
-4-
with foreign central banks, who might be led to believe that their 
dealings with the System, under swap arrangements, for example, were 
only one step removed from the public domain. He was reluctant to 
furnish a report in so much detail, and he raised the question whether 
the staff might not attempt to negotiate a less comprehensive report 
with the staff of the Subcommittee. 
Governor Daane stated that he sympathized with the views 
expressed by Governor Brimmer. The question of future relationships 
with foreign central banks was a real one. On the other hand, the 
Board was confronted with a specific request from a Congressional Sub-
committee. He, too, would prefer a less detailed report, and he asked 
Mr. Cardon whether that would not be feasible, within the framework of 
complying with the request. 
Mr. Cardon brought out that the answer, as proposed, was 
already somewhat short of what had been requested, because it did not 
supply copies of the actual communications with respect to the several 
loans. He added that the Foreign Relations Subcommittee no doubt had 
access to material far more sensitive than that involved here. It was 
possible that any attempt to negotiate might result in a request for 
additional information, and there was also the possibility that the Sub-
committee might conclude that the System was trying to hide something. 
Governor Brimmer then suggested that the reply be reworked, 
not with a view to omitting essential facts but for the purpose of 

1179 
10/31/67 
-5-
eliminating certain details of kinds that he described. Governor Daane 
supported Governor Brimmer's suggestion. 
Governor Robertson said that he had a somewhat different view. 
The letter as drafted asked that the information be kept confidential 
and stated why. If the Board's reply did not appear to be reasonably 
responsive, the information was likely to be published in any event, 
but with connotations that would create bad public relations. The 
draft of reply that had been prepared appeared to be in compliance with 
the request, and in his view its transmittal would represent the safer 
course. 
Chairman Martin indicated that he was inclined to agree with 
Governor Robertson. As a general principle, he considered it advisable 
to make as full disclosure as possible. 
Governor Maisel said that the paramount question, as he saw it, 
related to the right of the Congress to have access to information avail-
able to an agency of the Government. The issue was whether or not that 
right took precedence over possible injury to inter-central bank rela-
tionships . 
Governor Daane then suggested that the staff take another look 
at the draft in terms of possibilities for omitting interpretive details 
while still meeting Governor Robertson's point that the reply should be 
responsive. 
Mr. Sherman remarked that the staff could of course take a fur-
ther look at the draft and perhaps trim out some detail. However, the 

4 5 76 
10/31/67 
-6-
preparation of the reply had had concentrated staff attention in an 
attempt to reach a proper balance. The draft, as presented, was where 
the staff came out, with the hope, of course, that the information 
would not be published. 
Mr. Cardon mentioned that, since the reply had been under study 
for some time, undue further delay might result in an unfavorable reac-
tion on the part of the Subcommittee. 
Mr. Irvine pointed out that the amount of detail included in 
the proposed reply reflected in part the thought that the Board should 
be shown to have acted in a responsible manner in considering the loan 
requests. The Subcommittee had a great deal of information at hand on 
the Colombian situation, and it would seem to be in the interests of 
the System to demonstrate that the gold loans were not made without 
adequate justification. 
Governor Brimmer said he approached the problem on the assump-
tion that the information furnished was likely to be published, and he 
would like to have 24 hours in which to review the proposed reply 
against the background of that assumption. 
Governor Daane commented that he would not want the reply to 
be unresponsive. He felt that the reply could be sufficiently respon-
sive without the inclusion of certain details that seemed to him quite 
unnecessary. 
/ 
Governor Maisel observed that the risk must be acknowledged 
that the publication of information furnished on the Colombian loans 

11.77 
10/31/67 
-7-
might be slightly embarrassing to the Colombian authorities and, fur-
ther, in some way detrimental to central bank relationships in the 
longer run. Against those risks must be weighed the possibility that 
insufficient disclosure would create an impression that the System had 
not acted responsibly so far as the gold loan function was concerned, 
and the creation of such an impression might have repercussions in 
terms of other System lending activities. In drafting the proposed 
reply the staff had apparently weighed those offsetting considerations 
carefully. 
Following further discussion, it was agreed that action on the 
reply to the request from the Subcommittee would be deferred for 
24 hours to permit further review of the draft by Governors Daane and 
Brimmer, and that the matter would be considered again by the Board at 
tomorrow's meeting. 
Mr. Solomon observed that the questions brought out by the dis-
cussion of the Congressional request might suggest to the Board that it 
would be desirable to make another review of the System's gold loan 
policy. 
Chairman Martin replied that such policies should be kept under 
review on a continuing basis. In a broad sense, the question extended 
to whether bilateral central bank relationships were actually justified 
That was at least a debatable point. It went to the fundamental philos 
â€¢ - . 
; 
â€¢ 
ophy involved in obscuring certain operations for a period of time on 
the ground of benefit to the public interest. 

10/31/67

Governor Daane referred to situations in which monetary opera-
tions in the international sphere would be ineffective or even damaging 
to stability if a policy of immediate public disclosure was carried to 
the extreme. 
Chairman Martin agreed that the point was well made. His pur-
pose had been simply to bring out that there were two sides to the argu-
ment. The undertaking of such operations required a judgment by someone 
that the operations were in the public interest. Others might disagree 
with that judgment. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission having interposed no objection, a 
letter (copy attached as Item No. 5) was sent 
today to Chairman Staggers of the House Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce Committee suggesting 
amendment of one of the provisions of S. 510, a 
bill to provide for disclosure of ownership of 
corporate equity securities. The sending of the 
letter was in accord with the procedure agreed 
upon at the meeting on September 28, 1967. 
Governor Robertson today approved on behalf 
of the Board the following items: 
Letter to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget (copy attached 
a s Item No. 6) transmitting certain schedules for calendar years 1966, 
1967, and 1968, for use in presenting, on a memorandum basis, data on 
the financial operations of the Board of Governors in a separate sec-
tion of the 1969 Federal budget document. 
Memorandum from the Legal Division dated October 26, 1967, request-
ing confirmation of oral authorization for the detail of George F. McEvoy, 
a retired employee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to that Divi-
sion on a temporary contractual basis on October 19 and 20, 1967, to 
assist in the Division's work relating to the margin regulations, and 

1179 
10/31/67

recommending that Mr. McEvoy be appointed as a consultant effective to 
December 31, 1967, with compensation at the rate of $65 per day for 
each day worked for the Board and with transportation expenses and per 
diem to be paid in accordance with the Board's travel regulations. (It 
was noted that the Division might wish to make use of Mr. McEvoy's ser-
vices on a similar basis in 1968.) 
Memorandum from the Division of International Finance dated Octo-
ber 26, 1967, recommending that Patric H. Hendershott, Assistant Pro-
fessor at Northwestern University, be appointed as a consultant to that 
Division effective to December 31, 1967, with compensation at the rate 
of $55 per day for each day worked for the Board and with transportation 
expenses and per diem to be paid in accordance with the Board's travel 
regulations. 
Memoranda recommending the following actions relating to the Board's 
staff: 
Salary increase 
Linda Mae Maney, Clerk-Typist, Division of Research and Statistics, 
from $4,269 to $4,776 per annum, effective November 5, 1967.

Gentlemen: 
As requested in your letter of October 9, 1967, as 
amended October 25, 1967, the Board of Governors approves an 
increase in the issued and outstanding capital stock of your 
Corporation from $2,500,000 to $8,000,000 by the purchase of 
55,000 additional shares (par value $100 each) by First National 
City Bank, at a cost of $5,500,000. 
The Board of Governors also approves the amendment 
of Article SEVENTH of your Corporation's Articles of Association 
to read as follows: 
"SEVENTH. The authorized capital stock of this 
corporation shall consist of 200,000 shares of $100 
par value stock which shall be issued and fully paid

of the Federal Reserve Act and of the consent obtained 
thereunder from the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System." 
It should be noted that Section 25(a) of the Federal 
Reserve Act requires that the increase in issued and outstanding 
capital stock be fully paid in within ninety days after the date 
of this letter.

Dear Sir: 
Enclosed is a copy of a letter dated October 18, 1967, 
from Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Carlock asking 
that consideration be given to: 
(1) Extending to unfit $20, $50, and $100 Federal 
Reserve notes the local destruction procedures 
that are now being followed with respect to 
unfit $1, $5, and $10 Federal Reserve notes. 
(2) Continuing use of existing procedures for 
handling all unfit Federal Reserve notes above 
the $100 denomination under which these notes 
are cancelled and sent to the Treasury in 
half-note form for verification and destruction 
in the same manner as unfit National Bank notes 
and Federal Reserve Bank notes. (The Board 
understands that the existing regulation on the 
handling of National Bank notes and Federal 
Reserve Bank notes will be revised to provide 
for uniformity in processing.) 
(3) Using in connection with such local destruction 
of the $20 denomination a percentage verification 
of either 40 or 50 per cent, as compared to the 
present 10 per cent for $5's and 20 per cent for 
$10's. Mr. Carlock notes that the 100 per cent 
verification of $20*s currently performed by the 
Treasurer has resulted in relatively few differ-
ences in money value and that the expense of 
complete verification does not seem justified. 

-2-
â€¢1 1 P.P. 
(4) Using in connection with the local destruction 
of $50 and $100 Federal Reserve notes a 100 per 
cent verification, primarily because the volume 
is so small that any savings from a reduced 
verification would be relatively insignificant. 
The Board would like to receive, as soon as convenient, 
any comments your Bank may care to make with respect to the proposal 
in Mr. Oarlock's Letter of October 18. 
Also enclosed for your information is a copy of a letter 
from the Board to the Chairman of the Conference of Presidents 
requesting a recommendation with respect to the feasibility of 
using the formula basis for allocating redemption credit for unfit 
Federal Reserve notes in the $20, $50, and $100 denominations. 
Should the proposal contained in Mr. Oarlock's October 18 letter 
be placed in operation prior to a decision by the Conference on 
this matter, redemption credit for unfit notes in these denominations 
could of course be made on the basis of the present Bank of issue sort. 
Very truly yours, 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.

Dear Mr. Swan: 
The Presidents of all Federal Reserve Banks are 
being advised today that Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the 
Treasury Carlock has suggested extending to unfit $20, $50, 
and $100 notes the local destruction procedures that are 
now being followed with respect to unfit notes in the $1, 
$5, and $10 denominations. Mr. Carlock's request raises 
the question whether it would be appropriate to use a 
formula for allocating redemption credit for notes in the 
$20, $50, and $100 denomination or to continue on a perma-
nent basis the sort by Bank of issue for this purpose. The 
Board would appreciate the views of the Presidents' Confer-
ence on this matter. 
Very truly yours

October 31, 1967 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
S. 510, now pending before your Committee, would provide 
for disclosure of ownership of corporate equity securities under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board of Governors is in 
accord with the purposes of this bill, particularly as it would 
require disclosures relating to acquisition of substantial interests 
in banks, and equitable treatment of persons tendering bank stock 
in response to purchase offers. Bank stock could become less attrac-
tive as an investment, with the result that banks might find it more 
difficult to raise needed capital, if the interests of minority 
shareholders are not fully protected in connection with negotiations 
to merge or acquire banks. The proposed bill would take a note-
worthy step toward providing minority shareholders with the oppor-
tunity for prior notice, and the equal opportunity to dispose of 
their shares, which the Board believes necessary both for equitable 
treatment and good business practice. 
However, the Board notes that in its present form, the bill 
virtually exempts financing arrangements from disclosure where funds 
are provided by means of a loan made in the ordinary course of business 
by a bank. The Board is not aware of any reason why the same dis-
closure requirements should not apply to banks as to other lenders. 
In addition, as explained below, information as to bank financing 
of tender offers would materially assist the Board in carrying out 
its duties under the 1934 Act. For this reason, the Board would 
recommend deletion of the provision permitting non-disclosure of 
information relating to bank financing of tender offers. However, 
if your Committee believes, for any reason, that the name of the bank 
making such a loan should not be disclosed, the Board would urge that 
a provision be substituted that would accord confidential treatment 
to the identity of the bank lender. 
The sharp recent increase in the number of tender offers has 
highlighted certain problems under the Board's Regulation U (Loans 
by Banks for the Purpose of Purchasing or Carrying Registered Stocks), 

Honorable Harley 0. Staggers, Chairman - 2 -

issued pursuant to section 7(d) of the 1934 Act, the statute which 
S. 510 would amend. A significant amount of credit may flow into 
the securities markets through this channel, which has escaped margin 
regulation for technical reasons. Such credit could be brought within 
the scope of margin regulation under existing law, but in order to 
reach an informed conclusion in this area it would be helpful if the 
Board knew a good deal more than it does at present about the amount 
and character of such credit. 
Such information could perhaps be collected directly from 
banks, but this would impose an additional burden, particularly since 
reporting banks would first have to determine what loans involved 
"tender offers". The present bill places the responsibility for 
reporting on the borrower, who is in the best position to know the 
purpose of a loan. Thus, there would be less diffusion of responsi-
bility and considerable economy of effort if the Board could be 
furnished with the information it needs under the program already 
envisaged by S. 510. At the same time, the interests of offerees 
would better be served if they had available to them information on 
the terms of bank financing for tender offers. What collateral was 
to be provided, how long the loan was to remain outstanding, and how 
it was to be repaid, are all matters that could affect the decision 
whether or not to accept a tender offer, regardless of the source of 
the loan. 
An additional benefit would be realized in the area of 
supervision of the Board's Regulation U. Because such bank financing 
is typically short-term, the purpose of the loan has usually been 
accomplished by the time the situation comes to the attention of the 
supervisory authorities, and the loan has been, or is about to be, 
paid off. It would be helpful in ensuring compliance with the regula-
tion if advice were secured that a particular bank was financing an 
offer at the time when the offer was first made. 
Enclosure A herewith shows section 13(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 
as it would read with the exemption deleted, and Enclosure B shows 
the same section as it would read if non-disclosure of the lending 
bank's identity was substituted for the present complete exemption. 
Sincerely, 
Enclosures
