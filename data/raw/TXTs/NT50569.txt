Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Commercial Bank of Peoria 
Naf- • 
Lional Association, Peoria, Illinois, with Commercial National Bank 
°f Peoria was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller 
°f the Currency, the conclusion stating that the proposed merger (which 
W a s designed to facilitate a one-bank holding company arrangement) would 
have no adverse competitive effects.

A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Commercial Bank of Washington, Twisp, Washington, into Old 
National Bank of Washington, Spokane, Washington, was approved unani-
mously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency. 
The 
conclusion read as follows: 
There is no competition existing between Commercial 
Bank of Washington, Twisp, and Old National Bank of Wash-
ington, Spokane, and potential for development of compe-
tition between them appears remote. 
Thus, the proposed 
li i merger would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Central Banking System. 
In a memorandum dated January 21, 1970, 
fche Division of Supervision and Regulation and the Legal Division sug-
gested that the Board's staff meet with representatives of Central 
Banking System, Inc., Oakland, California, for the purpose of clarify-
ing the Board's position with respect to the capital position of 
Central Valley National Bank, Oakland, the holding company's lead 
bank, particularly as it related to the holding company's application 
acquire shares of Bank of Fairfield, Fairfield, California, a 
Proposed new bank. 
In a letter dated December 23, 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank 
San Francisco had been requested to advise the holding company of 
cne Board's intent to attribute signifi cant weight to the capital 
Position of the lead bank when considering additional proposals for 
bank acquisitions. 
The Board's staff believed that the application 
"hen pending to acquire Bank of Fairfield fell within the coverage of 

1/26/70 
-4-
the December 23 letter. 
However, the Reserve Bank and the applicant 
had assumed otherwise. 
If the staff had interpreted the intent of 
the Board correctly, the recommended meeting would allow applicant 
an opportunity, if it so desired, either to withdraw the Bank of 
^airfield application 
or request that it be placed in suspense pend-
ing improvement in Central Valley National Bank's capital position. 
Governors Mitchell and Maisel pointed out that the national 
hank examiners, at the time of most recent examination, had found 
the capital of the lead bank to be adequate. 
It was agreed, however, 
that the proposed discussion should be undertaken and that the re-
sults should be made known to the Board for consideration in 
•Connection with the pending application. 
The view was expressed by 
Several Board members that it would be inadvisable to permit the 
aPplication 
to be held in suspense. 
Nassau branch. A letter to First National Bank and Trust 
c°ropany of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma, granting permission for the 
establishment of a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, was approved, Governor 
Robertson dissenting and Governor Brimmer abstaining. A copy of the 
letter is attached as Item No. 5. 
Annual Report. With a memorandum dated January 21, 1970, 
Molony submitted in draft sections of Part I of the Board's Annual 
Report for 1969 relating to credit markets and financial flows; 
demands, resource use, and prices; and international payments and 

1/26/70 
-5-
reserves. A draft of an introductory section on monetary policy and 
the economy also had been distributed. 
Members of the Board were in agreement with the general tone 
°f the report. 
However, expansion of the treatment in some areas, 
Such as the international section, was suggested, as well as further 
delineation in the introductory section of the aims of monetary 
Policy in 1969 and the background against which it had evolved. 
Other 
changes, mostly technical in nature, were also suggested. 
Following further discussion, it was understood that the views 
expressed would be taken into account by the staff, along with other 
Suggestions that had been conveyed to the staff directly, in revising 
fche material for final clearance by the Board members. 
Governor Daane withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
lint 
Legislative recommendations. With a memorandum dated 
January 22, 1970, the Legal Division submitted a draft section on 
ie8islat ive recommendations for inclusion in the Board's Annual Report 
1969. Recommendations previously made by the Board with respect to 
Ending authority of Reserve Banks, par clearance, graduated reserve 
requirements, Reserve Bank purchase of foreign government obligations, 
and loans to bank examiners were repeated. 
The enactment of legisla-
tion with respect to one-bank holding companies would be urged, but 
with the view expressed that the version (H.R. 6778) recently passed 
ky the House was unduly restrictive. 

1/26/70 
-6-
Discussion related principally to the portion of the draft 
dealing with one-bank holding company legislation. 
It was suggested 
that the Board's position as expressed during 1969 should be recorded 
l n the Annual Report, with inclusion of the statement of principles 
that the Board had announced. 
Such an approach would preserve flex-
Ibility, which might be particularly desirable since the incoming 
Chairman's views on the subject were not known, and it would be in 
accord with the theory that the principal purpose of an annual report 
was to record what had taken place rather than to advocate. 
In further discussion it was suggested that the Board's 
Position with respect to bank credit card legislation likewise 
should be recorded. 
It was understood that the staff would proceed along these 
lines in preparing the legislative recommendations for final clearance 
ky the Board members. 
The memorandum from the Legal Division also noted that no 
^-egislative proposals for consideration by State legislatures had 
keen suggested by Board members or staff in response to the Division's 
mei*orandum of 
December 3, 1969, and it was proposed that a letter be 
Sent to the Bureau of the Budget stating that the Board had no proposals 
t o submit for consideration at this time.

This recommendation was approved unanimously; a copy of the 
letter sent to the Bureau of the Budget is attached as Item No, 6.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission to First National Bank and Trust Company of 
Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25 
of the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Nassau, Bahamas, 
and to operate and maintain such brancli subject to the provisions 
of such Section and of Regulation M. 
, 
In granting this permission, it is understood that the 
branch v?:!. 11 be used for developing new international business and 
not as a means of shifting loans or deposits from offices in the 
United States. 
It is also understood that there is to be no contact 
with the local public at the branch, and that its quarters, staff, 
and bookkeeping may, at least in part, be supplied under contract 
by another party. 
In view of the u nu sua 1 character of this operation, 
the foregoing permission is granted subject to continuing special 
observation anc! review by the Board and aftec due notice may be with-
drawn or modified. 
The foregoing permission is also granted on the 
condition that adequate information covering the branch's operations 
will be maintained at your head office and will be available to the 
Board and its accredited representatives. 
The Board should be 
promptly informed of any modification in the branch's methods of 
operation, including changes in any contract under which services 
are supplied to the branch. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before February 1, 1971, all rights granted hereby 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby 
granted will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank oi Kansas City, when the branch is opened for business. 
The Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Nassau.

First 
National Bank 
and Trust Company of Tulsa 
~2~ 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits 
payable only a: a branch of a member bank located outside of the 
States of the United States and the District of Columbia are exempt 
from any limitations on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 
and Regulation Q. Also, deposits at such branches are not generally 
subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D (but see Sec-
tion 213.7 of Regulation M). 
The general purpose of these exemptions 
is to allow foreign branches of United States banks to compete abroad 
with foreign banks. 
In these circumstances, it has long been and 
continues to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System to discourage 
deposits by United States residents at foreign branches of United 
States banks unless such deposits have beer placed to serve a defi-
nite, necessary purpose in connection with foreign or international 
transactions outside the United States. 
In approving this request, the Board has noted that the 
First National Bank and Trust Company of Tulsa has not previously 
engaged in foreign lending or investment and that the bank has no 
ceiling under the System's foreign credit restraint program. 
There-
fore, this approval is granted with the understanding that the es-
tablishment of the Nassau branch will not result in your bank's 
acquiring foreign assets in a manner inconsistent with the program. 
An exception to this understanding may be made if your bank has 
requests for credits to finance the exports of U. S. goods and 
services. 
However, in this event the bank should consult with the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City about the possibility of adopting 
a special ceil:'.ng within which such export credits might be granted. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon

Deputy Secretary.

Dear Mr. Ink: 
This refers to your letter of October 27, 1969, in which 
you invite the Board to submit legislative proposals for considera 
J-ion by State legislatures. 
It: is understood that proposals that 
the Bureau considers appropriate, after consultation with other 
interested Federal agencies, will be forwarded to the Committee on 
suggested State Legislation, Council of State Governments, for 
consideration. 
Proposals approved by the Council's Committee will 
be circulated among State legislatures at their next sessions. 
The Board of Governors has no proposals to submit for 
your consideration at this time. 
Very truly yours 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Deputy Secretary.
