approving revision of the employee salary struc-
tures applicable to the head office and branches 
and a special Grade 16 maximum of $21,500. 
Report on competitive factors. Unanimous approval was given 
to the transmittal to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of a 
report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger of 
The Ostrander Banking Company, Ostrander, Ohio, into The Delaware 
County Bank, Delaware, Ohio, in a form in which the conclusion read 
as follows: 
The proposed merger of The Delaware County Bank and 
The Ostrander Banking Company would eliminate existing 
and potential competition between them and reduce banking 
alternatives in the county from four to three. However, 
because of the small size of the last named bank and the 
community in which it is located, the adverse effect of 
the proposal on competition would be relatively inconse-
quential . 
Application of Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (Items 3-5) 
There had been distributed drafts of a proposed order and statement 
reflecting the Board's approval on April 25, 1967, of the application 
of Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, Buffalo, New York, for per-
mission to merge with The Bank of Perry, Perry, New York. A dissenting 
statement by Governor Robertson had also been prepared. 
The issuance of the documents on Monday, May 1, in the form 
drafted was authorized, unless members of the Board should suggest 
changes in the interim.

Secretary's Note: No changes having 
been suggested, the documents were 
released on May 1, 1967. Copies of 
the order, statement, and dissenting 
statement, as issued, are attached 
as Items 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 
Congressional testimony. The Vice Chairman stated that the 
House Banking and Currency Committee had requested testimony on Tuesday, 
May 2, with regard to S. 714 and H.R. 7347, bills to liberalize restric-
tions on loans to executive officers of member banks and officials of 
Federal credit unions. He further stated that the presentation of 
testimony by a member of the Board's staff, rather than a Board member, 
would be agreeable to the Subcommittee. 
At Governor Robertson's suggestion, Mr. Solomon, Director of 
the Division of Examinations, was authorized to testify before the 
Banking and Currency Committee with respect to the bills mentioned. 
Changes in Board membership. Governor Robertson noted that 
the incoming member of the Board, William W. Sherrill, would take his 
oath of office at the Federal Reserve Building on Monday, May 1, at 
approximately 3:30 p.m. and that this was the last meeting of the 
Board Governor Shepardson would attend in his present capacity. 
Governor Shepardson said that his Board membership had been a 
rewarding experience, one he had thoroughly enjoyed. Although there 
had been pressures associated with such service, he had not found them 
onerous. He would endeavor to continue to make a contribution to the 
Federal Reserve System in his capacity as Consultant to the Board.

Among other things, he would propose to give particular attention to 
the phase of the current study of the discount mechanism in which he 
had a particular interest. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Sherman and Kenyon then 
withdrew. 
Technical assistance assignment. Pursuant to the recommenda-
tion in a memorandum from the Director of the Division of International 
Finance dated April 26, 1967, the Board approved the assignment of 
James L. Pierce, Economist in the Division of Research and Statistics, 
to assist the Central Bank of Peru in training personnel in the use of 
the computer for economic research, it being understood that the assign-
ment would require a period of approximately three weeks and that 
Mr. Pierce's travel expenses and per diem would be paid by the Agency 
for International Development. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Note: Acting in the absence 
of Governor Shepardson, Governor Robertson 
today approved on behalf of the Board memo-
randa recommending the following actions 
relating to the Board's staff: 
Appointments 
Barry G. Craig as Legal Assistant, Legal Division, with basic 
annual salary at the rate of $8,218, effective the date of entrance 
upon duty.

ORDER APPROVING MERGER OF BANKS 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), an application by Manufacturers 
and Traders Trust Company, Buffalo, New York, a State member bank of 
the Federal Reserve System, for the Board's prior approval of the merger 
of that bank and The Bank of Perry, Perry, New York, under the charter 
and title of Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. As an incident 
to the merger, the sole office of The Bank of Perry would become a branch 
of the resulting bank. Notice of the proposed merger, in form approved

BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
Item No. 4 
4/28/67 
OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS TRUST COMPANY 
FOR APPROVAL OF MERGER WITH 
THE BANK OF PERRY 
STATEMENT 
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, Buffalo, New York 
("M&T"), with total deposits of about $735 million, has applied, 
pursuant to the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), for the Board's 
prior approval of the merger of that bank with The Bank of Perry, 
Perry, New York ("Perry Bank"), which has total deposits of about 
$11 million.""^ The banks would merge under the charter and name of 
H&T, which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As an incident 
to the merger, the sole office of Perry Bank would become a branch of 
M&T, increasing the number of its offices to 67. 
Competition. - M&T is headquartered in Buffalo, and about 
90 per cent of its total of 66 offices are located in the Buffalo 
metropolitan area, which is in the westernmost part of New York's 
Ninth Banking District. The sole office of Perry Bank is about 55 
miles southeast of Buffalo at Perry, near the eastern boundary of the 
Ninth District. Perry (population about 5,000) is the largest community 
1/ Figures are as of December 31, 1966. 

1857 
-2-
in Wyoming County (population about 35,000). M&T has no offices in 
Wyoming County; its nearest office to Perry is about 23 miles to the 
north in Batavia. Because of the distance separating the banks, and 
the presence of other banking offices in the intervening area, there 
is little competition existing between them. 
It does not appear that meaningful competition would 
develop between M&T and Perry Bank if they did not merge, although 
New York law permits a bank, subject to a home-office-protection 
feature, to branch de novo in the State Banking District in which it 
is located. Because of Perry Bank's relatively small size, it does 
not appear probable that it would establish a branch near an office 
of M&T. The home-office-protection restriction, as x^ell as the small 
size of the communities that might otherwise be available, would 
preclude M&T from establishing a new branch in or near Perry. 
M&T, with 26 per cent of the deposits, is the second 
largest of the 37 commercial banks in the Ninth Banking District; 
Perry Bank, with less than half of 1 per cent of the deposits, ranks 
2/ 
fourteenth." 
While the concentration of banking resources is high 
in the Buffalo metropolitan area, the relevant geographical market 
in this case consists of the area from which Perry Bank draws its 
business and in which concentration is not a factor. 
Perry Bank derives most of its business from the Perry 
community and from the surrounding area within a radius of about 
five miles. Perry Bank competes to some extent with eight offices 
2/ Figures are as of June 30, 1966. 

of sik banks, the largest of which (deposits of about $276 million) 
is headquartered in Rochester; this bank operates a branch in Mount 
Morris, which is nine miles east of Perry and in the Eighth Banking 
District. The other five banks range in deposit size from about 
$5 million to $24 million, and two of them are subsidiaries of a 
registered bank holding company. The communities in which the 
competing banking offices are located range in population from about 
400 to 4,000, and they are situated six to 14 miles from Perry. 
While M&T would be a stronger competitor than Perry Bank, it does 
not appear that the merger would adversely affect the banking 
offices in the vicinity of Perry; these offices are well established 
and draw the preponderance of their business from their own communi-
ties. 
The proposed merger would have no significant adverse 
effects on competition. 
Financial and managerial resources and prospects. - The 
banking factors with respect to each of the banks proposing to merge 
are generally satisfactory, as they would be with respect to the 
resulting bank. 
Convenience and needs of the communities. - The merger 
would affect banking convenience and needs only in the area presently 
served by Perry Bank. There is evidence that Perry Bank has found it 
necessary to share with other banks some of the loans that it has 
originated. These loans could easily have been accommodated by M&T. 
Further, Perry Bank has either refused or terminated several commercial 

and agricultural loans, most of which would have been provided by M&T 
In addition, M&T would offer several services not offered by Perry 
Bank, including fiduciary and advisory services, consumer and small 
business revolving loans, and other specialized loans. 
/ 
In general, M&T would offer a broad range of banking 
services, many of which are now available to the customers of Perry 
Bank only through the Mount Morris branch of a Rochester-based bank, 
nine miles from Perry, 
Summary and conclusion. - In the judgment of the Board, 
the proposed merger would benefit the banking convenience and needs 
of the area served by Perry Bank, and would not result in any 
significant adverse consequences for banking competition. 
» 
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the application 
should be approved.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR ROBERTSON 
Item No. 5 
4/28/67 
I differ from the majority as to the importance that should 
be attributed to the heavy concentration of commercial banking resources 
that exists in New York's westernmost Banking District. In New York, 
the Banking Districts are meaningful for considering competitive effects 
because banks are prohibited by State law from branching outside the 
District in which they are headquartered. District boundaries - like 
county boundaries where an intra-county branching restriction prevails -
define (although not precisely at the peripheries) the outer limits of, 
at least, a potential geographical market. The existence of meaningful 
geographical sub-markets within the wider area does not change this 
fact. Further, quite aside from whether a banking market tending toward 
District-wide proportions in this area might actually develop, this case 
presents the question of whether the existing sectional markets in the 
Ninth District should be permitted to develop, one-by-one, into oligopolies. 
M&T, with 26 per cent of the deposits and 28 per cent of the 
loans, is the second largest of the 37 commercial banks in the Ninth 
Banking District. Perry Bank, with deposits of $11 million, is the 
fourteenth largest bank in the Ninth District. The absorption of Perry 
Bank by M&T will increase the latter's share of District deposits by less 
than 1 per cent; but it does not follow that the resulting increase in 
concentration of banking resources is inconsequential. "[I]f concentra-
tion is already great, the importance of preventing even slight increases 
in concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventual deconcen-
1/ 
tration is correspondingly great." 
1/ United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 373 U.S. 321, 365 n. 42. 

1661 
-18-
It should be noted that 30 of the 37 banks in the Ninth 
District hold altogether only 10 per cent of the aggregate deposits 
and loans. M&T and the largest banking organization together hold 
about 70 per cent of all the commercial bank deposits and loans in 
the Ninth District; and the three largest banking organizations 
account for about 83 per cent. The sixth and seventh largest each 
hold about 2 per cent; and the third and fifth largest hold, 
respectively, about 13 per cent and 3 per cent. Quite plainly, the 
acquisition by one of the three largest banking organizations in 
the Ninth District of any of the other banks would not in itself 
involve a large percentage increase in the concentration of banking

resources. But if such acquisitions were allowed to continue - as 
the majority's rationale for approving this application would permit -
the result would be a three-bank oligopoly of three organizations 2/ 
blanketing not only the Buffalo area but the entire Ninth District. 
Even if the merger would not eliminate existing or potential 
competition between the merging banks that is not the controlling 
consideration in assessing the effect of the transaction on competi-
tion. The 1950 amendment to section 7 of the Clayton Act repealed the 
narrower test of whether a merger's effect might be substantially to 
lessen competition between the acquiring and the acquired corporations 
and made the test whether the effect of a merger might be substantially 
2/ The three largest banking organizations already possess the financial 
and managerial resources to dominate banking in the Ninth District; all 
they lack is a few more key locations and the majority of the Board seems 
willing to let them acquire the remaining independent banks. 

-3-
18G2 
to lessen competition in any way. And, of course, there can be no 
doubt that the competitive consequences of a proposed transaction 
under the Bank Merger Act must be measured by the standards of the 
3/ 
antitrust laws. 
As its basis for approving the application, the majority 
cites alleged "convenience and needs" benefits to the area now 
served by Perry Bank. In this matter, the majority relies 
exclusively on the self-serving declarations of the applicant, and 
confers Brobdingnagian stature on Lilliputian circumstances. During 
the twelve-month period preceding this application, Perry Bank shared 
with other banks only three loans that, either alone or in combination 
with other borrowings by the same customer, exceeded Perry Bank's legal 
lending limit. During the period 1964-66, perry Bank refused or 
terminated only ten commercial and agricultural loans, and M&T does 
not claim that it would have extended all of these credits. 
In point of fact, the only evidence on the matter that can 
be regarded as objective clearly shows that the legitimate credit needs 
of the area served by Perry Bank are being met. In other words, while 
M&T offers a broader range of services than does Perry Bank, there is 
no evidence that the banking needs of the Perry community are not being 
adequately and conveniently met. Moreover, the record indicates that 
the charges that M&T x^ill exact for certain services may be higher than 
those now prevailing at Perry Bank. In my judgment, the applicant has 
not established that the merger will benefit the banking convenience and 
3/ See, e.g., 112 Cong. Rec. 2233-35, 2337 (1966) (remarks of Rep. Patman 
and Rep. Reuss); see also United States v. First Natfl Bank of Houston, 
35 U.S. Law Week 4303 (U.S. Mar. 27, 1967).

needs of the area. Thus, even if the competitive consequences of the 
merger could be denominated as not significantly adverse (with which 
I could not agree), the transaction would not be in the public interest; 
the "convenience and needs" factor is not strong enough to outweigh 
even that kind of competitive factor. 
I conclude, on the record in this case, that the majority's 
approval of the proposed merger is contrary to the purpose and the 
directions of the Bank Merger Act, and that it sets an unfortunate 
precedent both for future cases in the Ninth Banking District and for 
the general administration of the Act.
