ment recommended denial.

Governor Mitchell expressed disagreement with the view that 
the Colorado Springs market was an especially attractive one. He 
cited figures showing that adjusted gross incomes in Colorado Springs 
were below those of other major Colorado markets. Time deposit com-
parisons also cast doubt on the judgment of the applicant in offering 
to pay a substantial premium in order to gain entrance into the 
Colorado Springs market, and the role in the area of military bases 
and the Air Force Academy was scarcely the equivalent of growth 
industry. 
Governor Mitchell also commented on the holding company 
structure in Colorado, and on the fact that an affiliation now exist-
ing between Colorado Springs National Bank and a small suburban bank 
would be dissolved under the present proposal. It seemed to him that 
to allow applicant to consummate the proposed transaction and break 
up that existing affiliation would be as acceptable as de novo entry 
or acquiring one of the smaller banks in the area. He believed that 
the low level of savings and time deposits in the market was attributable 
not only to relatively low incomes but also to the sluggishness of 
local banks in soliciting such funds, and that entry by applicant 
would stimulate competition. 
Governor Maisel said that to him the critical question was 
the impending increase in concentration among Colorado holding 
company systems. If the present proposal and several that were known 

VMS 
6/30/70 
-5-
to be coming were approved, Denver U. S. Bancorporation and First 
National Bancorporation would hold approximately 40 per cent of 
total deposits on the Eastern Slope of Colorado. 
Governor Brimmer also spoke of the trend toward State-wide 
bank holding company systems in Colorado. The present proposal 
would give Denver U. S. Bancorporation representation in each of the 
six major banking markets in Colorado, and applications in the pipe-
line would spread the coverage of other holding companies. He did 
not see that it was necessary for applicant to get into the Colorado 
Springs market; it seemed to have a viable system without such entry. 
Moreover, the premium being paid for the Colorado Springs bank would 
go far to support a de novo entry until it became profitable or to 
acquire one of the smaller banks and expand it. The size of the 
premium that applicant was willing to pay suggested to him that 
Colorado Springs was in fact an attractive market. 
Further discussion indicated that the members of the Board 
present were evenly divided in their views, Governors Mitchell, Daane, 
and Sherrill being inclined toward approval and Governors Robertson, 
Maisel, and Brimmer toward denial. Action on the application was 
therefore deferred until such time as all members of the Board could 
participate. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance.

Export credits. Governor Brimmer reported that at a meeting 
within the next few days the National Advisory Council Alternates would 
consider proposals to limit competition in the extension of export 
credit by developed countries. The Alternates would try to arrive 
at a U. S. Government position to be presented during discussions 
within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development later 
in July. In preparation for the meeting of the Alternates, he would 
like to have any comments members of the Board might wish to make, 
on the basis of staff analyses that would be distributed. 
It was understood that the other members of the Board would 
transmit their comments to Governor Brimmer. 
One-bank holding companies. Two letters had been sent to 
Senator Proxmire yesterday, one stating the Board's position and the 
other Governor Robertson's personal views, regarding legislative

proposals Senator Proxmire expected to introduce as a substitute for 
Senate Banking and Currency Committee Print No. 1, relating to one-bank 
holding companies. Members of the Board subsequently had been furnished 
a comparison of the provisions of Senator Proxmire's proposals and 
the Committee Print. At today's meeting Governor Robertson said that 
he had this morning replied to another inquiry addressed to him by 
Senator Proxmire, regarding the "Williams amendment," dealing with the 
treatment of existing holding companies. A copy of Governor Robertson's 
letter is attached as Item No. 5.

Mr. Gardon then reported on the status of the Committee's 
consideration of various issues. A principal point of concern was 
the desire of some Committee members to avoid unduly harsh effects 
on existing bank holding companies, and to that end a body of support 
had developed for the Proxmire proposal and for the Williams amendment. 
Mr. Cardon also compared the Senate Committee Print with the 
bill passed by the House, two major differences being that the Com-
mittee Print did not include a negative "laundry list" of permissible 
activities and that it was more lenient in its treatment of existing 
bank holding companies. 
A point on which the Board expressed special interest was 
a provision in the Committee Print that would allow a domestic bank 
to establish through its holding company a subsidiary principally 
engaged in business outside the U.S., subject to whatever conditions 
the Board might impose. Presumably such a subsidiary could conduct 
a substantial part of its business in the U.S., whereas a subsidiary 
established under the Edge Act could conduct in the U.S. only such 
business as was incidental to its foreign business. Members of the 
Board expressed concern about the implications of this provision and 
requested that Mr. Cardon make known their concern to the Committee 
staff. In response to inquiries, Mr. Cardon said there would probably 
be a further opportunity for the Board to record its position at a 
later stage of the legislative process.

Bank of Lansing. Pursuant to the understanding reached at 
the meeting on May 28, 1970, regarding supervisory procedures with 
respect to Bank of Lansing, Lansing, Michigan, a letter had been 
transmitted to the bank through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
outlining a consent cease and desist order procedure contemplated by 
the Board. In a memorandum dated June 26 the Legal Division reported 
that the bank had agreed to enter into the procedure. Attached to 
the memorandum were drafts of an agreement and consent to be executed 
by the bank and the Board through designated officials and a notice 
of charges and consent order, with related documents. 
The Board authorized the execution of the documents. 
(Note: 
Copies of the documents, as subsequently executed, have been placed 
in the Board's files.) 
"Parsons Group" banks. Governor Robertson referred to a 
meeting scheduled for next week at the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, to be attended by representatives of the Federal bank 
supervisory agencies and the Michigan State bank supervisor, to discuss 
the possibility of taking supervisory action against two banks of the 
"Parsons Group," one of which was Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit, 
and the other a State nonmember bank. He said that Mr. Solomon and 
other members of the staff of the Division of Supervision and Regulation 
would attend and would report to the Board any conclusions reached.

Governor Mitchell commented on conversations with First Vice 
President Baughman of the Chicago Reserve Bank regarding a program 
proposed by the Reserve Bank to require Bank of the Commonwealth to 
reduce its indebtedness at the discount window. It had been emphasized 
to Mr. Baughman that a program should not be instituted at this time 
that might endanger the bank. Governor Mitchell was uneasy because 
of certain implications that there was not complete coordination be-
tween the Reserve Bank's examination and discount functions. In the 
ensuing discussion, suggestion was made that representatives of the 
Board visit the Chicago Reserve Bank to discuss arrangements for 
handling the Commonwealth problem. Further comments related to the 
efforts of the bank to obtain other funds and the advisability of 
arranging that any program to be imposed on the bank first be cleared 
with the Board. 
Cleveland salary structure. Pursuant to the recommendation 
of the Division of Personnel Administration in a memorandum dated 
June 25, 1970, the Board unanimously approved revised employee salary 
structures for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and its Cincinnati 
and Pittsburgh Branches. A copy of the letter sent to the Cleveland 
Reserve Bank is attached as Item No. 6. 
Additional members of the staff withdrew at this point. 
Commercial paper market and related matters. Members of the 
staff reviewed information that had come to them with respect to 

1950 
6/30/70 
-10-
developments in the commercial paper market. Staff then suggested 
that there be another telephone conference call with the discount 
officers of the Federal Reserve Banks during which it would be pro-
posed that the Reserve Banks engage in another round of conversations 
with member banks. The tone of the conversations would be that the 
Reserve Bank wanted to stay abreast of developments. The member 
banker would be asked for his impression of loan demand around the 
mid-year date, how much of the loan demand was believed to be coming 
from firms experiencing runoffs of commercial paper outstanding, how 
much in unused lines of credit to commercial paper issuers was esti-
mated to be outstanding, and whether the member banker believed that 
the June 30 borrowings from his bank by commercial paper issuers 
would represent their peak drawings or whether further borrowing re-
quests were expected. 
It was also suggested that the Reserve Banks might indicate 
to the member banks that it was desirable, both from the point of view 
of banks and the public interest, that creditworthy commercial paper 
issuers who might be squeezed out of the commercial paper market be 
accommodated within the banking system. That comment would be made 
only if a suitable opportunity arose in the course of the conversation, 
and it would be made carefully, accompanied by sufficient cautions so 
that the banker did not conclude that the Federal Reserve was suggesting 
that unsound loans be made.

6/30/70 
-11-
Finally, for any bankers to whom the Reserve Bank had not 
previously mentioned the availability of the discount window or the 
expected bank use of certificates of deposit to raise funds to make 
loans to commercial paper issuers, comments would be made along the 
lines that had been suggested during the previous conference call 
with the discount officers and in the Board's press statement regard-
ing limited suspension of Regulation Q ceilings. 
Board members expressed concern about misunderstandings that 
might arise from any comment about the desirability of accommodating 
within the banking system commercial paper issuers squeezed out of 
the commercial paper market. It was felt that banks, if they extended 
credit and suffered losses, might allege that the credit had been ex-
tended at the suggestion of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, it was 
agreed that it would not be suggested to the Reserve Banks that they 
make any comment of the kind that had been proposed in their conversa-
tions with member banks. However, it was agreed that the Reserve Bank 
might ask whether the member bank had canceled or reduced any lines of 
credit to commercial paper issuers. 
It was understood that the staff would report back to the 
Board on the results of the contemplated conversations. 
Mr. Hackley then reviewed for the Board his memorandum of 
June 29, 1970, in which he had summarized the authority of the Reserve 
Banks under present law to extend credit to individuals, partnerships, 

VJ5Z 
6/30/70 
-12-
and corporations and had discussed Board proposals for legislation to 
liberalize the lending authority of the Reserve Banks. 
Governor Maisel then suggested that the Board should address 
itself to the question whether, in an emergency, the Federal Reserve 
ought to function as a lender of last resort. Asked whether he felt 
that in such a situation the Federal Reserve should lend money to a 
large company that had been found not creditworthy by the principal 
commercial banks, Governor Maisel said that that probably would depend 
on whether the company could provide adequate collateral. He noted 
that in his opinion one could not look at overall credit problems in 
the same terms as an individual bank viewed a prospective extension 
of credit. He added that one of the original purposes of the Federal 
Reserve System was to provide an expandable currency in times of need. 
Mr. Holland suggested that some banks might at present be 
adopting a cautious attitude in view of the Penn Central episode, and 
members of the Board commented that the System should try to help 
banks that were taking a constructive attitude, when they demonstrated 
that they needed help. 
Governor Maisel then expressed the view that the staff should 
bring forward an operational scheme, or contingency plan, that would 
spell out when the Federal Reserve should step in and when it should 
not, when banks should be told that the Federal Reserve was available, 
and exactly what procedures would be envisaged. 

12353 
6/30/70 
-13-
It was noted that the staff had prepared a list of questions 
that the System would have to face, and there was a suggestion that 
the list of questions be made available to Board members for con-
sideration at an early date. 
Proposed salary increase. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 
had requested approval of a $4,000 per annum salary increase for Senior 
Vice President Clifford G. Miller, retroactive to June 1, 1970, and the 
Division of Personnel Administration had recommended disapproval. 
The Personnel Division's recommendation was approved. However, 
a suggestion was made that there might be discussion with the Cleveland 
Bank by Governor Mitchell, as Chairman of the Committee on Organization, 
Compensation, and Building Plans, and there was another suggestion that 
the rather abrupt letter to the Bank denying the request be rewritten. 
(Note: Attached as Item No. 7 is a copy of the letter 
*. • .'J 1 •' 7 
subsequently sent to the Cleveland Bank, with the approval of Governor 
Mitchell.) 
Governor Brimmer then suggested discussion by the Board of the 
report of the most recent examination of the Cleveland Bank, and it 
was agreed that the report would be listed on an agenda for discussion 
at the first convenient date. 
Assignment of Mr. Sammons. In response to a request that had 
been received, the Board agreed to grant a six-month extension of the 
arrangement whereby the services of Robert L. Sammons, Associate 

1354 
6/30/70 
-14-
Director of the Division of International Finance, were being made 
available to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
in Paris. 
Presidential Commission. On the basis of a report by Mr. 
Holland concerning a discussion that he had had with President Swan 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, it was agreed not to 
accede to a suggestion that a person be added to the payroll of the 
Seattle Branch who would provide services to the staff of the Pres-
idential Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation who had 
been furnished working quarters at the Branch. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
grants its permission for Bank of Boston International, New York, 
New York, pursuant to the provisions of Section 25(a) of the Fed-
eral Reserve Act, to establish a branch in Luxembourg, and to 
operate and maintain such branch subject to the provisions of such 
Section and of Regulation K. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business on or before July 1, 1971, all rights granted hereby shall 
be deemed to have been abandoned and the authority hereby granted 
will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please advise the Board of Governors, through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, when the branch is opened for business, 
furnishing information as to the exact location of the branch. 
The Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch in Luxembourg. 
The above permission is granted on the condition that 
adequate information covering your branch operations in Luxembourg 
will be maintained at your head office and will be available to the 
Board and its accredited representatives. 
With respect to the establishment of foreign branches, 
funds provided by home office (whether in the form of allocated 
capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as foreign 
assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. In 
view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 
investments on the balance of payments, the above consent is given 
with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's operations 

1956 
Bank of Boston International

maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained outside the 
United States. Accordingly, it is understood that any investment 
required will be made within the guidelines established under the 
foreign credit restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the 
foreign lending and investment activities of The First National 
Bank of Boston and its subsidiaries, and that due consideration is 
being given to the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon

Deputy Secretary.

The Honorable William L. Dawson, Chairman, 
Committee on Government Operations, 
House of Representatives, 
2157 Rayburn House Office Building, 
Washington, D. C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Dawson: 
The Board has received your letter of June 12 requesting its 
comments on H. R. 17977 (91st Cong.), a bill "To limit the sale or dis-
tribution of mailing lists by Federal agencies." The bill would amend 
the "Public Information Act of 1966" (5 U.S.C. 552) by adding a new 
subsection thereto. 
The Board understands that the purpose of the amendment is 
to protect members of the public from possible invasions of privacy 
which may occur when Federal agencies supply lists of names and addresses 
to persons requesting such lists under the requirements of the Public 
Information Act. The lists dealt with by the amendment include lists of 
employees or former employees of an agency, persons licensed by an 
agency, and persons registered or required to file information with an 
agency. The effect of the bill would be to permit continued disclosure 
of such lists only where they will not be used for "purposes of commercial 
or other solicitation", or for purposes unlawful under any State or 
Federal law, or where the list is made available by an agency as a 
necessary part of its statutory functions. Criminal penalties are 
provided for violation of the provisions of the proposed amendment. 
The Board notes that the emphasis of the bill, insofar as it 
is concerned with the use of such lists for purposes of solicitation, 
appears to be directed at commercial solicitation. However, the 
language used - "commercial or other solicitation" - might be interpreted 
to prohibit furnishing lists for other - possibly desirable - purposes 
of solicitation, such as solicitations of information by scholars in 
connection with research projects. Because the new subsection would be 
a criminal statute the words "commercial or other solicitation" probably 

1958 
The Honorable William L. Dawson 
-2-
would be narrowly construed, but it might be preferable either to limit 
expressly the solicitations in question to commercial solicitations, or 
to specify the types of solicitations for which the lists may not be used. 
Apart from the foregoing reservation, the Board has no objection 
to the proposed legislation. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

Mr. A. B. Merritt, 
First Vice President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 
San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. Merritt: 
This is in response to your letter of February 27,1970, trans-
mitting a request by the Bishop Trust Company of Honolulu that the Board 
modify its Regulations D and Q to permit the Trust Company to sell Federal 
funds to a member bank. 
A member bank may not: purchase Federal funds from the Trust 
Company on the basis of the present exemption from those regulations for 
certain member bank liabilities to other banks (§ 204.1(f)(1) and 
§ 217.1 (f)(1). Under that exemption, the purchasing bank's obligation 
must be ".issued to (or undertaken with respect to) and held for the ac-
count of" another bank. Even if the Trust Company were to be considered 
a "bank", sales of funds by it are not for its own account but rather for 
the account of the beneficiaries of the trusts,' a category that includes 
individuals and corporations. 
The Board has concluded that expansion of the interbank liability 
exemption to permit a member bank to purchase Federal funds from the Trust 
Company would be inconsistent with the Board's policy on access to that 
market. 
Broadly stated, the Board's major purpose in narrowing, effec-
tive February 12, 1970, the scope of persons who may sell Federal funds 
to a member bank was to prevent member banks from acquiring funds from 
individuals and corporations without regard to reserve requirements and 
interest rate controls, except in connection with a repurchase agreement 
involving Government securities eligible for Federal Reserve purchase.

Mr. W. Braddock Hickman, Chairman, 
Conference of Presidents, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 44101 
Dear Mr. Hickman: 
Replies to a recent staff inquiry indicate that the 
Federal Reserve Banks continue to have a wide range of employee 
loan policies. Since the last System review of these policies 
was in 1948, the Board feels that it would be timely for the 
Conference of Presidents to review the current situation and 
to re-examine the fundamental question whether Reserve Banks 
should make loans to employees for other than educational 
purposes. In addition, the Board would like the Conference 
to consider the merits of a uniform System policy and, if 
advisable, recommend such a policy. 
Enclosed is a memorandum that may be helpful in this 
connection. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary. 
Enclosure 

.1961 
MEMORANDUM 
The practice of making Federal Reserve Bank funds available 
for emergency loans to employees in need of temporary financial 
assistance due to illness in their family, or similar cases, has, 
with Board approval, been in effect since 1921. As to the legality 
of the practice, the Board's General Counsel, in a memorandum dated 
March 11, 1921, rendered the following opinion in connection with 
the creation by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of a revolving 
fund for the purpose of making loans to needy employees: 
"In my opinion, if in the judgment of the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
and of the Federal Reserve Board, the creation of 
the fund in question is advisable as a means of 
promoting efficiency among the Bank employees, the 
power to create the fund may be considered a power 
which is incident to the business of banking within 
meaning of the provision of section 4, and a power 
which the Federal Reserve Bank has legal authority to 
exercise with the approval of the Federal Reserve Board." 
In early 1948, a staff study undertaken at the Board's request 
disclosed that there were employee loan funds at all Reserve Banks, 11 
having been established by the Bank and 1 (San Francisco) by the employees. 
In a letter dated February 10, 1948, the Board requested the 
Presidents' Conference to consider the topic of "Loans to Employees" 
with the suggestion that Credit Unions might take care of the merito-
rious cases in which employee loans were sought. The matter was 
discussed at the Joint Meeting on February 27, 1948, and some of the 
Presidents expressed the view that, since the loan funds were small in 
amount, the determination of their size might be left to the directors 
of the Federal Reserve Banks. 
Chairman Eccles said that the Board had 
•felt that consideration should be given by the Banks to the establish-
ment of Credit Unions, but that, inasmuch as they did not appear to 
meet the needs of the Federal Reserve Banks, the Board would undertake 
to establish some basis for its approval of loan funds at the Banks 
which would be based upon the number of employees at each Bank or some 
other reasonable consideration. 
Subsequently, the Board forwarded to the Reserve Banks a 
letter, dated March 12, 1948 (S-1017), which included the following 
authorization: 

1 3 6 2 
-2-
"After considering the views of the Federal Reserve 
Banks with respect to the use of Bank funds for making 
loans to employees and the worthwhile purposes such 
employee loan plans serve, the Board has decided to 
interpose no objection to their continuance. The Board 
is of the opinion, however, that loans to employees by 
the Federal Reserve Banks should be kept within rea-
sonably low limits. This limit for such loans at any 
Bank, including branches, should not be increased from 
the existing authorized limit to an amount in excess 
of $15,000 without first submitting the matter to the 
Board for its consideration." 
At the time of the Board's letter, the authorized limits at New York 
were $25,000 on the fund for loans to needy employees and $10,000 on 
the fund'for educational loans. Therefore, the $15,000 limitation did 
not apply at: that office. 
In reply to a request from the Atlanta Reserve Bank to increase 
its loan fund from $15,000 to $30,000, the Board stated, in a letter 
dated July 29, 1.949, that it would not look with favor upon the Atlanta 
Bank advancing additional funds to increase its employees' loan fund 
beyond $15,000 and mentioned the following: 
(1) the Board feels that 
a Federal Reserve Bank should not enter into competition for loans 
with other legitimate lenders and that normally employees should finance 
their needs from other reputable sources; (2) it believes that loans 
from the employees' loan fund advanced by the Federal Reserve Bank 
should be made only in necessitous cases of an urgent character to help 
an employee out of an emergency and where accommodations cannot be 
obtained elsewhere; and (3) on the basis of experience at the other 
Federal Reserve Banks, except New York where they have a larger number 
of employees, an employees' loan fund of $15,000 or less has been 
adequate to take care of all necessitous loans for the welfare of 
employees. 
Until 1960 there were no other requests for increases' in loan 
fund limits0 
In 1960, 1967, and 1970 the New York Reserve Bank was 
Granted permission to increase the maximum amount of its educational 
loan fund from $10,000 to $20,000, from $20,000 to $40,000, and from 
$40,000 to $100,000, respectively. 
The current staff review indicates that some Federal Reserve 
Banks are continuing to use Bank funds to make loans to employees for 
such purposes as: rent and security payments, moving expenses, consol-
idating bills, income tax payments, and other similar purposes at less 
than a third of the market interest rate.

The following may be noted in the attached table: 
1. With che exception of the St. Louis and San 
Francisco Banks, all Reserve Banks provide 
funds for use in making loans to employees. 
2. The New York Reserve Bank has a separate fund 
for educational loans, while the Atlanta and 
San Francisco Banks have employee Bank clubs 
which do not require the use of Bank funds. 
3. The maximum amounts of the loan funds range 
from $5,000 at: Boston to $100,000 at New York, 
with individual loan limits ranging from $600 
to the fund limit. 
4. The reasons for loans vary from urgent emer-
gencies to rent, moving expenses, tuition, 
consolidating bills, and income tax payments. 
5. The interest rates vary from zero to the prime 
rate. 
6. There were 968 loans made during 1969 which 
amounted to $247,289 in total. 
7. Half of the Reserve Banks have not recently 
required the use of Bank funds to meet the 
credit needs of their employees since they 
have either credit unions or employee bank 
clubs.

Item No. 5 
6/30/70 
June 30, 1970 
The Honorable William Proxmire 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 20510 
Dear Senator Proxmire: 
Your letter of June 29, 1970, asks for my views 
on a proposed amendment to the pending bank holding com-
pany legislation that would (1) permit any existing one-
bank holding company brought within the coverage of the 
Bank Holding Company Act by the pending legislation to 
acquire nonbanking organizations as long as the net worth 
of the company's bank is less than $10 million, (2) per-
mit such a company to acquire nonbanking organizations as 
long as the net worth of the bank does not exceed 25 per 
cent of the net worth of the entire holding company sys-
tem, (3) require Board approval before any such company's 
bank may merge with another bank, (4) require the approval 
of the bank's primary federal bank supervisor before any 
such company or its nonbanlc subsidiaries may inject addi-
tional capital into the bank, and (5) prohibit the bank 
from paying dividends in excess of its current earnings. 
I oppose adoption of such an amendment. I believe 
that the approach of the amendment is totally inconsistent 
with the purposes of the Act. Not only would the proposed 
amendment condone a continuation of a combination of a 
bank and nonbank corporations in one system, but it would 
also permit the holding company to expand virtually without 
limit into new nonbanking activities. I believe that all 
bank holding companies - whether they own one or many 
banks - should be treated alike under the Act. If the 
Congress considers that the risks of potential evils in 
a combination of banking and nonbanking activities in a 
certain proportion is consistent with the public interest, 

1 9 6 ( > 
The Honorable William Proxmire:-
it should revise the Act accordingly for all companies 
rather than provide special treatment for conglomerates 
in existence at the present time. I am aware of no rea-
son for treating a conglomerate bank holding company dif-
ferent from a congeneric one, insofar as the potential 
evils of combining banking and nonbanking businesses are 
concerned. 
The merits of the particular provisions of the 
amendment imposing limitations on the expansion of the 
holding companies within its coverage are also question-
able. For example, as a bank's deposits grow, sound 
banking suggests the addition of capital funds as a 
cushion of protection for depositors. To provide that 
additional capital cannot be injected by a bank holding 
company into a controlled bank without the approval of 
the Board does not provide additional protection - in 
fact, such a provision is illusory. If a controlled bank 
needs additional capital to provide adequate protection 
for its depositors, the Board could not fail to give ius 
approval. 
The foregoing are my own necessarily hurried views; 
however, you will recall that Chairman Burns responded to 
a question submitted by you for the record of the hearings 
on the pending legislation by stating that adoption of such 
an amendment would be contrary to the purposes of the Act. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) 
" Mr. W. Braddock Hickman, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 44101 
Dear Mr. Hickman: 
This letter will serve to confirm your telephone 
conversations with Governor Mitchell concerning the salary 
increase proposed for Senior Vice President Clifford G. Miller 
in your letter dated June 11, 1970. 
While the Board does not question your Bank's 
assessment of either Mr. Miller's performance or the contribution 
he has made over his many years of service, it nevertheless feels 
that a salary increase such as now proposed is a matter more 
properly considered at the year-end annual review of officers' 
salaries--especially in light of the fact that the Bank has 
regularly recognized Mr. Miller's performance by salary adjust-
ments over the past several years. Moreover, the Board noted 
that the proposed increase would place Mr. Miller's salary 
noticeably above that of First Vice President MacDcnald and felt 
that such a salary relationship would contravene established 
principles of Reserve Bank salary administration. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Kenneth A. Kenyon 
Kenneth A. Kenyon, 
Deputy Secretary.
