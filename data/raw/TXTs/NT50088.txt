establishment of branches in (1) Elizabeth

Mall Shopping Center, Kinston, operations 
now conducted at 806 Vernon Avenue to be 
discontinued simultaneously. 
Letter to Union Trust Company of Maryland,

Baltimore, Maryland, approving the estab-
lishment of a branch in Easton. 
Letter to The Middle Tennessee Bank,

Columbia, Tennessee, approving the

Letters to Chelmont State Bank, El Paso, 
7-8 
Texas, (1) approving its application for 
membership in the Federal Reserve System, 
and (2) granting its request for permis-
sion to carry reduced reserves. 
Request for unpublished information (Item No. 9). There had 
been distributed a memorandum dated June 1, 1967, from the Legal Divi-
sion regarding a request by counsel for Provident National Bank and 
Central-Penn National Bank, both of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for 
certain unpublished information in connection with a pending Clayton 
Act proceeding involving those banks. 
The request called for various papers prepared by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia regarding the competitive factors involved 
in the proposed merger of the banks, and an opportunity to take a depo-
sition from Reserve Bank Vice President Joseph R. Campbell. Counsel 
for the banks indicated an intention, depending upon information 

2192 
6/2/67 
-4-
obtained through the deposition, to call Mr. Campbell as a witness at 
the trial. 
The Reserve Bank's memorandum filed with the Board on the pro-
posed merger had expressed the view that "the result of the merger would 
be an increase in competition rather than a reduction in it." However, 
the conclusion of the Board's report on competitive factors transmitted 
to the Comptroller of the Currency stated that the "overall effect of 
the proposed merger on competition would be significantly adverse." 
The Legal Division's memorandum set forth the reasons given by 
counsel for the banks in support of the request, discussed the merits 
of the request and the probable consequences of refusal to grant access 
to the papers in question, and reviewed the circumstances of an earlier 
request by the Department of Justice for access to similar Reserve Bank 
work papers and for interview of a staff member who had worked on the 
Reserve Bank's memorandum filed with the Board. The Division recommended 
that the Board decline to authorize the Reserve Bank to furnish the 
papers and that, if they should be subsequently subpoenaed, a Reserve 
Bank official respond by declining to produce any unpublished informa-
tion or give testimony with respect thereto, basing his refusal on the 
Board's Rules Regarding Information. It was recommended also that a 
Reserve Bank official (but not Vice President Campbell, who was recuper-
ating from surgery) be allowed to answer questions that did not involve 
unauthorized disclosure, but decline to answer any questions that would 

2133 
6/2/67 
-5-
call for such disclosure, basing this position also on the Board's 
Rules. A draft of letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
was attached to the memorandum. 
Mr. O'Connell indicated that it was believed that a court would 
regard the requested papers as intra-agency information and would not 
require them to be produced in response to a subpoena. He noted also 
that the terms of the proposed letter were consistent with the response 
made by the Board to the request of the Department of Justice in October 
1966. 
After discussion the letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia was approved unanimously. A copy is attached as Item No. 9. 
Application of Denver U. S. Bancorporation (Item No. 10). There 
had been distributed a memorandum dated June 1, 1967, from the Legal 
Division regarding an application of Denver U. S. Bancorporation, Inc., 
Denver, Colorado, for a determination that the activities planned to be 
undertaken by two proposed nonbanking subsidiaries, Lincoln Agency, Inc., 
and Western Fidelity Life Insurance Company, were of the kind described 
in section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as to make inappli-
cable the prohibitions of section 4 of the Act with respect to the acqui-
sition or retention of shares in nonbanking companies. 
Since the Act requires that such determinations be made on the 
basis of the record made at a hearing, tentative arrangements had been 
made for a hearing at 10:00 a.m. on July 11, 1967, at the Board's 

2194 
6/2/67 
-6-
offices. The Civil Service Commission had selected Mr. Philip J. 
La Macchia as hearing examiner, and Messrs. Via and Cloth of the Legal 
Division would serve as Board counsel. Attached to the memorandum was 
a draft of order for hearing. 
Issuance of the order was approved unanimously, and Mr. La Macchia 
was designated as hearing examiner. A copy of the order is attached as 
Item No. 10. 
Messrs. Daniels, Cloth, Via, and Golden then withdrew from the 
meeting. 
Changes in control of banks (Item No. 11). On November 7, 1966, 
pursuant to action on October 26 and preceding discussions, the Board 
replied to an inquiry from Chairman Patman of the House Committee on 
Banking and Currency regarding implementation of Public Law 88-593, 
which requires notification to the appropriate Federal banking agency 
of changes in control of insured banks and of loans by insured banks 
secured by 25 per cent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an 
insured bank. The Board's reply was accompanied by a list of banks 
whose stock was reported to have been transferred or pledged, their 
deposits, and the names of the transferees, beneficial owners, borrow-
ers, and lending banks involved. A supplemental report was sent to 
Chairman Patman on February 14, 1967. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated May 31, 1967, 
from the Division of Examinations regarding a request from Chairman 
Patman for "the number of changes in control reported to your office 

£195 
6/2/67 
-7-
since September 1964 involving management and other controlling persons 
who in your estimation do not meet the character and ability standards 
otherwise required by your agency for membership in the Federal Reserve 
System." The information was requested in connection with a study of 
acquisitions, changes in control, and bank stock loans recently autho-
rized by the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance. Similar requests had 
been addressed to the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
Since enactment of the statute the Reserve Banks had received 
reports in eleven cases where changes in control and management were 
thought to involve questionable circumstances. Of the banks involved 
in these cases, three were no longer members of the System, three were 
subsequently acquired by satisfactory controlling interests, and one 
had improved considerably. Control had not changed or improved at the 
remaining four banks, and they were receiving more than usual super-
visory attention. 
The memorandum observed that circumstances surrounding changes 
in control of a bank that was already a member of the System were sub-
stantially different from those surrounding an application for member-
ship in the System. It was pointed out that it would be difficult at 
this stage to reconstruct each change in control to determine whether 
the parties involved would have been acceptable, under the "character 
and ability" test mentioned by Chairman Patman, as management of the 

Zi 
6/2/67 
-8-
same bank if it were applying for membership. The Division recommended 
that the response to Chairman Patman state in effect that in none of 
the reports of changes in control had the question of conforming to 
membership standards arisen and therefore the reports had not been 
reviewed from that standpoint. A draft reply in those terms was 
attached to the memorandum. 
It was noted that the responses made to Chairman Patman by the 
Comptroller and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had followed 
this same general approach, namely, that reports of changes in control 
under Public Law 88-593 did not seem related to the question whether 
the new ownership would meet the requirements for granting a national 
bank charter or for an application for Federal deposit insurance. 
Governor Mitchell raised the question whether more specific 
information should not be furnished in the Board's reply. 
Mr. Solomon commented that the Board might then be in the posi-
tion of seeming to agree that the standards applied to membership appli 
cations should also be applied to changes in ownership. Whereas the 
burden of proof was on an applicant for membership, once a bank was in 
the System the burden of proof was on the System if a question of revo-
cation of membership arose. The staff was also apprehensive that the 
supplying of figures might be followed by a request for details regard-
ing the individual cases, with a consequent problem of how to safeguard 
the confidentiality of information regarding individual institutions. 

2197 
6/2/67 
-9-
Moreover, in three of the eleven cases in which questions had occurred 
the banks subsequently had relinquished System membership. If the 
Board's response were to include that information, inquiries about 
those banks might then be directed to the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. 
Governor Mitchell said that while he agreed to a certain extent, 
he believed it should be possible to indicate that there had been eleven 
instances warranting further inquiry, that seven of those cases had been 
resolved, and that the remaining four continued under surveillance. 
Governor Robertson then suggested a rearrangement of the draft 
letter that would incorporate certain figures mentioned in the memo-
randum, state that in none of the cases still under surveillance was it 
believed that a threat was posed to the bank's continued operation, and 
indicate that the statute had some value in focusing attention promptly 
on questionable changes in control. 
Governor Sherrill said he would be reluctant to seem to equate 
System membership or national bank charter requirements with appraisal 
of changes in bank ownership; he believed there were significant differ-
ences. While he had not thought the problem through carefully, it 
seemed to him that application of the tests of chartering or membership 
to sales of bank stock would begin to impinge upon the right of bank 
shareholders to sell their stock, and that a considerable impact might 
result. 

21:98 
6/2/67 
-10-
Governor Robertson expressed agreement, but said he believed 
that if Chairman Patman were informed that of the eleven cases ques-
tioned only four remained unresolved, this would indicate simply that 
the System was carrying out the purpose of the statute. 
After further discussion during which suggestions were made 
for changes in emphasis and language, it was understood that the letter 
would be revised in the light of views expressed, and when in a form 
satisfactory to Governor Robertson would be sent to Chairman Patman. 
A copy of the letter in the form in which it was subsequently trans-
mitted is attached as Item No. 11. 
Messrs. Shay, Egertson, Maguire, and McClintock then withdrew 
from the meeting. 
Travel by Mr. Reynolds. Governor Robertson referred to a 
request that Mr. Reynolds be authorized to participate in the Fourth 
Annual Maxwell Institute on the United Nations from August 27 through 
September 1, 1967, at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The theme of the 
meeting was to be "International Financial Organizations." 
Governor Robertson indicated that he was bringing the matter 
to the Board's attention because the Maxwell Institute proposed to pay 
the expenses of participants in the meeting, including transportation, 
hotel accommodations, and meals, whereas it had been the Board's prac-
tice to pay expenses incurred by its representatives in attending meet-
ings of this character. He believed there was no question regarding 

2199 
6/2/67 
-li-
the desirability of having Mr. Reynolds represent the Board at the 
Maxwell Institute, but his own feeling was that the Board should pay 
the expenses. It was Mr. Reynolds' impression that while no problem 
was likely to arise if the Board wished to specify that it would pay 
his transportation expenses, it was possible that the Institute was 
without administrative machinery through which reimbursement by the 
Board for food and lodging could be handled. 
Discussion of the point raised by Governor Robertson included 
a comment by Governor Mitchell that although he agreed with the Board's 
general practice, there could be special circumstances in particular 
situations that would justify departure from that practice. 
Attendance by Mr. Reynolds at the Maxwell Institute meeting 
was then authorized and payment of his transportation expenses was 
approved unanimously. It was understood that the Institute would be 
apprised of the Board's readiness to pay Mr. Reynolds' expenses for 
food and lodging in connection with the meeting, and that if the Insti-
tute was in a position to accept reimbursement, payment of those expenses 
also was approved. 
Foreign travel for Mr. Lee (Item No. 12). There had been dis-
tributed a memorandum dated June 1, 1967, in which Mr. Reynolds recom-
mended that the Board reply affirmatively to a White House request that 
the services of Henry F. Lee, Economist in the Division of International 
Finance, be made available for an assignment in Vietnam for about 30 days 

2200 
6/2/67 
-12-
beginning sometime toward the end of June. It was understood that Mr. 
Lee's travel expenses would be paid by the Agency for International 
Development or by the National Bank of Vietnam. 
Mr. Reynolds recommended also that the Board approve an addi-
tional period of up to three weeks' travel for Mr. Lee to permit him 
to visit central banks and other financial institutions in several coun-
tries of South and Southeast Asia, with payment by the Board of his 
travel expenses incident to such visits. 
The recommendations were approved unanimously. A copy of the 
letter sent to the White House is attached as Item No. 12. 
Leave of absence for Reserve Bank employee (Item No. 13). The 
Board approved unanimously a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York interposing no objection to a leave of absence with pay for Camille 
B. Pantuliano, an economist on the Bank's staff, for approximately six 
months to permit her to assist in the work of the President's Commis-
sion on Budget Concepts. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 13. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: Attached as Item 
No. 14 is a copy of a letter sent today 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minne-
apolis approving a special Grade 16 
maximum of $21,500 in the employee 
salary structure of the Bank as re-
quested in the Bank's letter of May 25, 
1967. This letter was sent pursuant to 
the authorization given to the Secretary 
at the meeting of the Board on June 29, 
1966.

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approves 
the application made on behalf of Chelmont State Bank, El Paso, Texas, 
for stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, subject to the numbered 
conditions hereinafter-set forth. 
1. Such bank at all times shall conduct its business and 
exercise its powers with due regard to the safety of 
its depositors, and, except with the permission of the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, such 
bank shall not cause or permit any change to be made in 
the general character of its business or in the scope 
of the corporate powers exercised by it at the time of 
admission to membership. 
2. The net capital and surplus funds of such bank shall be 
adequate in relation to the character and condition of 
its assets and to its deposit liabilities and other 
corporate responsibilities. 
In connection with the foregoing conditions of membership, 
particular attention is called to the provisions of the Board's Regula-
tion H, regarding membership of State banking institutions in the Federal 
Reserve System, with especial reference to Section 208.7 thereof. A copy 
of the regulation is enclosed. 
It is noted that three of the bank's directors are apparently 
Primarily engaged in activities, which if they were directors of a 
member bank, would violate the provisions of Section 32 of the Banking 
Act of 1933 and the Board's Regulation R. Therefore, such individuals 
should be removed from the board of directors prior to admission to 
membership in the System.

It is noted that the bank is exercising limited fiduciary 
powers. Should the bank at any future time desire to broaden its 
corporate activities, or exercise any powers not exercised at the 
time of admission to membership, it will be necessary,'under condition 
of membership numbered 1, to obtain permission of the Board of 
Governors. 
If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's 
charter is made, the bank should advise the Federal Reserve Bank, 
furnishing copies of any documents involved, in order that it may be 
determined whether such change affects in any way the bank's status 
as a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
Acceptance of the conditions of membership contained in 
this letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the board 
of directors, and a certified copy of such resolution should be trans-
mitted to the Federal Reserve Bank, Arrangements will thereupon be 
made to accept payment for an appropriate amount of Federal Reserve 
Bank stock, to accept the deposit of the required reserve balance, 
and to issue the appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock 
to the bank. 
The time within which admission to membership in the Federal 
Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished is limited 
to 30 days from the date of this letter, unless the bank applies to the 
Board and obtains an extension of time. When the Board is advised 
that all of the requirements have been complied with and that the 
appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock has been issued to the 
bank, the Board will forward to the bank a formal certificate of 
membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board of Governors sincerely hopes that you will find 
membership in the System beneficial and your relations with the 
Reserve Bank pleasant. The officers of the Federal Reserve Bank 
will be glad to assist you in establishing your relationships with 
the Federal Reserve System and at any time to discuss with represen-
tatives of your bank means for making the services of the System 
most useful to you. 
Very truly yours,

Mr. J. V. Vergari, Vice President 
and General Counsel, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 19101 
Re: U.S. v. Provident National Bank and 
Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia 
Dear Mr. Vergari: 
This acknowledges your letter of May 11, 1967, enclosing 
a letter addressed to Dr. Willis J. Winn, Chairman, Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia, from Mr. Frederic L. Ballard, counsel for the 
defendant banks in the above-captioned action, wherein Mr. Ballard 
requests documents and testimony in connection with the scheduled 
July 11, 1967, trial of the above case. Mr. Ballard's request has 
been forwarded to the Board for action for the reason that the docu-
ments requested, and potentially the testimony sought, constitute 
unpublished information of the Board as that term is defined in sec-
tion 261.2(a) of the Board's Rules Regarding Information, Submittals, 
and Requests. 
The Board has declined to grant Mr. Ballard's request for 
copies of "any memoranda, reports or other documents setting forth the 
opinion of the staff and/or the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Philadelphia with respect to the competitive effects of the 
[Provident National Bank and Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia] 
merger and/or the convenience and needs of the community to be served." 
The Board's decision reflects its judgment that Mr. Ballard's reasons 
given in, support of his request lack the required "good cause" that the 
Board must find in order to authorize the disclosure requested. 
As to Mr. Ballard's proposal to take the deposition of Vice 
President Campbell of your Bank, the Board understands that Mr. Campbell's 
present physical condition, following recent surgery, would make ill-
advised his giving of a deposition as proposed, and that, similarly, 
Mr. Campbell's condition would warrant his being excused as a witness 

00"j O 
Mr. J. V. Vergari 
-2-
at the trial of this case in July. Should Mr. Ballard„ in the 
alternative, seek the deposition of another of the Bank's officers 
or employees, the Board authorizes testimony by such deponent, it 
being understood that the authorization thus given does not contem-
plate that defendant banks' counsel will have access to, or be given 
information from, any memoranda, reports, or other documents in your 
Bank's files as to which counsel's access has herein been denied. 
• 
In order to assure against the possibility of unauthorized 
disclosure, it is suggested that you be present during any deposition 
taken by banks' counsel and that, if necessary, you interpose appro-
priate objection to any attempt to elicit oral or documentary evidence 
to which access has been denied. In the event of any such attempt, 
opposition thereto would appear appropriately based upon section 261.2 
and/or section 261.5 of the Board's Rules Regarding Information, Sub-
mittals, and Requests. 
It will be appreciated if advice of the Board's determination 
herein set forth is given to Mr. Ballard. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.

hearings shall be private and shall be attended only by parties and 
their representatives or counsel, representatives of the Board,

ceedings: Provided, however, That, on written request by a party or 
representatives of the Board, or on the Board's own motion, the Board, 
unless prohibited by law, may permit other persons to attend or may 
order the hearing to be public." 
Any person desiring to give testimony in this proceeding 
should file with the Secretary of the Board, directly or through the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, on or 
before July 7, 1967, a written request containing a statement of the

The Honorable Wright Patman, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your letter of April 26, 1967, regarding 
changes in control of management under Public Law 88-593. 
With our letters to you of November 7, 1966 and February 14, 
1967, regarding administration of Public Law 88-593, there were enclosed 
schedules listing reports in changes in control of State member banks 
during the period September 12, 1964, to December 31, 1966. Upon receipt 
of each of these reports, the Reserve Banks have, according to standing 
instruction, forwarded to the Board a copy of the report together with 
a statement, regarding the background of the new owners and management, 
if known by the Reserve Bank, or that they are not known and an investiga-
tion is to be made. The findings of any investigation are forwarded 
to the Board. In addition, representatives of the Reserve Banks contact 
the new owners as promptly as possible to apprise them of our supervisory 
interest in their ownership of the bank. If there is any question as to 
whether the safety of the bank will be jeopardized by any action of the 
new owners or management, closer than usual contact with the bank is 
maintained through more frequent examinations, progress reports, and 
discussions with boards of directors. 
As you are aware, Public Law 88-593 involves only the receipt 
of reports of changes in control and does not include any predetermination 
of the abilities of management. In this respect, it appears to recognize 
the fact that once a bank has been admitted to membership in the System 
the law does not prescribe "character and ability standards" for con-
tinued membership in the Federal Reserve System. Such membership can be 
terminated only for specific malpractices or misconducts. We do believe, 
however, that Public Law 88-593 has been beneficial in that it has re-
sulted in the reporting of some cases, which might not have come to the 
System's attention as promptly, where special supervisory attention was 
appropriate due to the changes in control. Of these cases most have been 
resolved to our satisfaction. In fact, only four remain subject to con-
tinued special surveillance. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson
