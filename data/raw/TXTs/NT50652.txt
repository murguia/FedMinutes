regarding a Treasury draft letter to the Senate

S. 3822, a bill to provide deposit insurance for

Insurance subsidiary of holding company. 
In a memorandum 
dated June 16, 1970, the Legal Division discussed a request presented 
by the New York Reserve Bank on behalf of Security New York State 
Corporation, Rochester, New Y o r k , a registered bank holding company, 
for an interpretation of section 4(c)(5) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act. 
The Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring voting 
shares of any nonbanking company, with certain exceptions, among which 
are "shares of the kinds and amounts eligible for investment by 

99 
1

national banking associations . . 
A national bank located in a 
town with a population not exceeding 5,000 is authorized to act as a 
general insurance agent. 
Under the concept of the Board's operations 
subsidiaries ruling, a bank in such a town m a y furnish insurance ser-
vices through a wholly-owned subsidiary, performing, at locations at 
which the bank is authorized to engage in business, functions that 
the bank is empowered to perform directly. 
The Board had construed section 4(c)(5) to carry over to a 
holding company privileges equal to those of national banks. 
There-
fore, a holding company, without Board approval, could acquire all of 
the shares of an agency to be operated in any town with a population 
not exceeding 5,000 in which a subsidiary has a banking office. 
The 
issue presented was whether the agency must confine its operations to 
the town and its environs, or whether it could solicit business 
throughout the State or the country. 
The Legal Division's conclusion was that the insurance agency 
operations should be confined to the town and its environs, princi-
pally because without such limitation a holding company could conduct 
an insurance business without regard to the requirements of section 
4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
A draft letter to that 
effect was attached to the Division's memorandum. 
Governor Mitchell expressed doubt about the recommended posi-
tion insofar as it would appear to limit not only the location of the 

8/4/70 
-5-
insurance agency's offices but also the location of its customers. 
It 
did not seem reasonable to him to say that insurance business could be 
carried only for residents of the town or its environs. 
He pointed 
out that a bank was free to accept a deposit or make a loan without 
regard to the customer's location. 
It was noted, however, that, in the absence of the geographi-
cal restriction, an insurance agency subsidiary of a bank holding com-
pany could utilize a base in a small town for widespread operations 
without obtaining approval under section 4(c)(8). 
It was understood 
that this potential had already been brought to the attention of mem-
bers of Congress in connection with legislative proposals relating to 
one-bank holding companies. 
Further discussion included comments on distinctions that 
could be made between operating an insurance business and soliciting 
insurance business, and on methods of soliciting business beyond the 
small-town base. 
The predominant view was that the legislative his-
tory indicated an intent of Congress that the line be held on the geo-
graphical extent of an insurance subsidiary's business. 
A number of 
suggestions were made for changes in the draft letter to strengthen 
the application of that principle, as well as for clarification. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood that a 
revised draft letter would be prepared for the Board's consideration. 
Time deposit-securities plan. 
In a memorandum dated July 10, 
1970, the Legal Division discussed a proposal by a member bank to 

2249 
8/4/70 
-6-
offer its customers a "Combination Savings - Bond Plan," concerning 
which the Comptroller of the Currency had requested the Board's v i e w s . 
The customer would maintain with the bank a time deposit and in addi-
tion purchase a participation in certain Government securities, which 
would be subject to repurchase by the bank at the customer's option. 
The customer's combined yield on his investment would exceed interest 
at the maximum rate payable under Regulation Q , Interest on Deposits, 
if the funds were invested solely in a time deposit. 
The Legal Division recommended that the Board inform the Comp-
troller that the proposed plan would involve an abuse of the exemption 
from deposits for bank liabilities on repurchase agreements involving 
Government securities because the bank could pay any rate it wished 
for the use of customer's funds without being effectively limited by 
the amount of its Government securities portfolio. 
A draft letter was 
attached to the Division's memorandum. 
There was general agreement that the tie-in of the deposit 
and the purchase of Government securities was an objectionable feature, 
and suggestion was made that the draft letter be revised to emphasize 
that fact. 
At the conclusion of the discussion unanimous approval was 
given to the sending of a letter in the form attached as Item No. 10. 
Multi-State bank holding company. 
The Legal Division, in a 
memorandum dated July 16, 1970, discussed whether section 3(d) of the 

f 
8/4/70 
-7-
Bank Holding Company Act prevents formation of a multi-State holding 
company by a subsidiary of a multi-State holding company. 
Barclay's Bank Limited, a United Kingdon corporation and a 
registered bank holding company, held more than 25 per cent of the 
voting shares of (1) Barclay's Bank, D . C . 0 . , a United Kingdom corpo-
ration conducting a commercial banking business in the United States 
through two branch offices in New York City, and (2) Barclay's Bank 
of California, a commercial bank organized under the laws of Califor-
nia. 
For reasons of administrative convenience, Barclay's Bank 
Limited proposed that Barclay's Bank, D . C . 0., acquire the shares of 
a new bank in New York that would take over the domestic business at 
present handled by the New York offices. 
Barclay's Bank, D . C . 0 . , 
would thereupon become a bank holding company. 
The holding company 
would be based in New Y o r k , because the deposits of the present two 
branches were greater than those of Barclay's Bank of California. 
Under the terms of section 3(d), therefore, the new holding company 
could expand only in the State of New Y o r k . 
Because of that fact, and 
also because Barclay's Bank Limited was not prohibited from acquiring 
the New York bank directly, the Legal Division concluded that there 
seemed to be no reason to construe the statute to prevent the forma-
tion of a new multi-State holding company. 
A draft letter in those 
terms was attached. 
Discussion emphasized that the proposal represented merely a 
reorganizational program, with no change in ability to expand. 

o o t r i 
8/4/70 
-8-
However, M r . Hexter suggested that language be added to the letter to 
the effect that the approval would remain in effect only as long as 
Barclay's Bank, D . C . 0., remained a subsidiary of Barclay's Bank 
Limited, thus precluding the possibility that a spin-off of the New 
York subsidiary could leave Barclay's Bank Limited free to expand into 
another State. 
The letter was then approved unanimously in the form attached 
as Item No. 11. 
Excess computer time sales. 
In a memorandum dated July 28, 
1970, the Division of Data Processing recommended that the Board sell 
excess time on its computer system to Government organizations at the 
following rates: 
Hours per month 
I 
Price per hour 
0-10 
$350.00 
11-25 
336.00 
26-50 
315.00 
51 and up 
290.50 
After discussion, the recommendation was approved unanimously, 
subject to approval by Governor Sherrill of criteria designed to 
insure that computer time would not be sold to such an extent as to 
interfere with the Board's own needs for computer services. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Bank of the Commonwealth. 
Governor Robertson reported that a 
letter had been received from Bank of the Commonwealth, Detroit, 

* v »cr-> 
8/4/70 
-9-
Michigan, advising that various steps were in process looking toward 
entering into a consent cease and desist order. 
Those steps included 
acceptance of the resignations of four persons serving as officers 
and directors. 
However, the letter included a sentence stating that 
one of the reasons for acceptance of those resignations was assurance 
that the Federal Reserve would provide funds necessary to carry the 
bank through. 
Such a statement was not acceptable, and Governor 
Robertson had been in touch with the bank with a view to obtaining 
another letter from which the sentence in question would be deleted. 
Holding company legislation. 
Governor Robertson reported on a 
meeting he had attended at which representatives of several agencies 
were present, the purpose of which was to attempt to obtain agreement 
on the position to be taken by the Administration on certain features 
of proposed bank holding company legislation. 
The meeting then adjourned.

August 4 , 1970 
Bankers International Corporation, 
16 Wall Street, 
New York, New Y o r k .

Gent 1 emen: 
Reference is made to your letter of M a y 23, 1970, re-
questing certain suspensions and/or waivers of conditions contained 
in the Board's letter of March 3 , 1969, which granted consent for 
your Corporation ("BiC") to purchase and hold approximately 60 per 
cent of the capital stock of Thai Investment and Securities Co., 
Ltd. ("TISCO"), Bangkok, Thailand. 
The Board has considered your request regarding TISCO's 
activities as a broker, dealer, and underwriter of securities. 
That consideration included the fact, that BIC is not engaged in 
banking; and especially the relationship becween the possible ac-
quisitions of certain stocks as a result of such activities and 
the statutory prohibition on the purchase and holding of stock of 
a
 corporation "engaged in the general business o.f buying or selling 
g o o d s , w a r e s , merchandise or commodities in the United States," or 
transacting any business in the United States except such as in 
the judgment of the Board. . .may be incidental to its international 
or foreign business. . . . " 
It was the judgment of the Board that 
l n 
a
 foreign country where such transactions are usual in connection 
With the business of banking or other financial operations, and 
provided such stocks were acquired for underwriting or dealing but 
not as investment, and were not held for an unreasonable time, such 
acquisitions would not be inconsistent with the quoted statutory 
prohibition. 

2 2 5 4 
Bankers International Corporation 
-2-
Accordingly, the Board concluded that it would be per-
missible for TISCO under the aforementioned condition to act as 
dealer and underwriter of stocks (including rights to acquire 
stocks), including shares of issuers engaged in the types of busi-
ness cited in the preceding paragraph, so long as stocks so acquired 
vere disposed of within a reasonable length of time and provided 
that the specific consent of the Board be obtained for any acquisi-
tions of stock of individual issuers, not covered in the case of 
underwriting operations by firm commitments from subunderwriters 
or other purchasers, in excess of $500,000 or 25 per cent of the 
voting shares of any company. 
Stocks acquired in connection with underwriting and dealing 
m 
securities need not be reported in accordance with Section 211.8(d) 
of Regulation K . 
However, they are to be reported as a separate 
class (together with date of acquisition) in any Call Report of Con-
dition or in any other information requested regarding TISCO in 
accordance with condition (2) of the second paragraph of the Board's 
letter of March 3, 1969, granting consent to BIC's investment in 
IISCO. 
A l s o , full information on TISCO's activities as a broker, 
dealer, or underwriter of securities is to be made available on 
request during any examination of BIC. 
The foregoing applies only to acquisitions of stocks as 
a result of underwriting operations or in connection with maintaining 
a dealer's inventory. 
All other acquisitions of stock by TISCO, 
for portfolio investment purposes or otherwise, are subject to the 
provisions of Section 211.8 of Regulation K . 
Your letter also requested that TISCO be permitted to 
acquire stocks in connection with merger or acquisition operations 
where TISCO would undertake to act as an intermediary and where it 
may at times be required to take title. 
It is understood that any 
stock acquired in these circumstances would be held only temporarily 
and as part of a service to the parties involved. 
The Board has concluded that acquisitions of stocks as 
described in the preceding paragraph are essentially fiduciary in 
character and would be permissible for TISCO without regard to the 
limitations and requirements set forth in Section 211.8(a) and (b) 
of Regulation K . 
H o w e v e r , the Board will expect full details in 
regard to such transactions in any reports called for under con-
ditions (2) and (3) in the Board's letter of March 3 , 1969. 

Bankers International Corporation

A s further requested in your letter, the Board grants con-
sent to the continued holding of shares of TISCO by BIC after TISCO 
issues up to the equivalent of $5,000,000 of obligations with matu-
rities in excess of one y e a r , provided such obligations are issued 
within five years from the date of this letter. 
Subject to continuing observation and review, the Board 
also suspends, until further notice, the provisions of subparagraph (1) 
of the second paragraph of its letter of March 3 , 1969, so far as 
they relate to restrictions set forth in Section 211.9(a), (b), and 
(c) of R e g u l a t i o n K . 
Hie Board also considered your request for the suspension 
of condition (1) so far as it relates to the limitation of stock 
acquisitions under the General Consent to 25 per cent of the voting 
shares of a n y corporation when the stock-acquired by TISCO was in 
i-elation to an attempt to develop such corporation to the point of 
a public share offering, provided, however, that the per cent of 
shares acquired would not exceed 50 per cent nor the cost over 
?j00,000, and that the stock would be disposed of within five years. 
The Board has concluded that this request should not be 
granted. 
H o w e v e r , there is nothing to prevent TISCO from acquiring 
"P to 25 per cent of a local corporation's stock, at a cost of 
V500,000 or less, in the situations you outlined and also making 
a
 qualified commitment to acquire subsequently an additional amount 
of stock. 
W h e r e an acquisition is of the type you specify in your 
letter, the Board believes it would be appropriate for BIC to file 
a preliminary or tentative application (even though an acquisition 
is not yet a s s u r e d ) . 
Applications for acquisitions of this type can 
will be handled in a very expeditious manner, assuming that ad-
equate information is furnished.

10015 
Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letters of April 21, M a y 28, 
and June 8, 1970, requesting suspension of the standard conditions 
prescribed in the Board's letter of June 2 2 , 1967, which granted 
consent for your bank to acquire, either directly or indirectly, 
up to 48 per cent of the voting shares of Banco del Comercio 
( B a n c o " ) , Bogota, Colombia. 
You stated that only 43 per cent of B a n c o
1
s outstanding 
shares have been acquired and that your holdings have not represented 
a majority of shares voted at any stockholders' meeting since 1967. 
You stated that there are presently 6,526 shareholders of Banco of 
which 14 own 100,000 or more shares including 2 holding over 1,000,000 
shares each. 
Your indirect holdings of 12,900,000 shares represent 
the largest single block of outstanding stock. 
It is understood 
that Banco's Board of Directors, composed of seven principal directors 
and seven alternates, includes only one principal director and one 
alternate representing your bank. 
You further stated that the daily management of Banco is 
irected by the bank's president who is also a director. 
However, 
three individuals in senior management of the bank are officers of 
Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation, a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of your bank.

On the basis of the information furnished, the Board con-
siders that your substantial equity investment in Banco and the 
participation of your representatives in the active operational 
management of Banco constitute effective control of that bank. 
Your request for suspension of the standard conditions prescribed 
in the Board's letter of June 2.2, 1967, is, therefore, denied.

tinue to hold the stock of Banco Hipotecario Lar Brasileiro S.A. 
(
I | _ 
R 
Banco L a r " ) , Rio de J a n e i r o , Brazil, after Banco Lar acquires all 
of the stock of Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios Ltda.-
INVESTIL ("INVESTIL"), Rio de J a n e i r o , Brazil, at a cost of approx-
imately $45,000 (equivalent), provided the shares are acquired within

of shares of INVESTIL by Banco Lar is granted subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) 
That CMOBC shall not h o l d , directly or indirectly,

purchase and hold stock, or if INVESTIL establishes 
any branch or agency or takes any action or under-
takes any operation'in Brazil or elsewhere, in any 
m a n n e r , which at the time would not be permissible 
to CMOBC; 
(2) 
T h a t , w h e n required by the Board of Governors, CMOBC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding

That any share acquisitions or dispositions by INVESTIL 
be reported under Section 211.8(d) of Regulation K in 
the same manner as if INVESTIL were a corporation organ-
ized under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act; and 
(4) 
That Banco Lar shall not carry on its books the shares

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letter of June 17, 1970, requesting 
consent of the Board of Governors for your Corporation ("BNYIC") to 
continue to hold 3,000 shares of Bankone Realisations Limited ("Bankone"), 
Nassau, Bahamas, acquired at a cost of $3,000 without the prior con-
sent of the Board. 
As you arc now aware, acquisitions of such shares require 
the prior consent of the Board of Governors which was not obtained. 
However, as requested in your letter and on the basis of the informa-
tion furnished, the Board of Governors grants permission for BNYIC 
to continue to hold the shares of Bankone subject to the following 
conditions: 
(1) 
That BNYIC shall not hold, directly or indirectly, 
any shares of Bankone if Bankone at any time fails to 
restrict its activities to those permissible to a 
corporation in which a corporation organized under 
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, 
with the consent of the Board of Governors, pur-
chase and hold stock, or if Bankone establishes any 
branch or agency or takes any action or undertakes 
any operation in the Bahamas or elsewhere, in any 
m a n n e r , which at the time would not be permissible 
to BNYIC; 
(2) 
T h a t , when required by the Board of Governors, BNYIC 
will furnish the Board with such reports regarding 
the activities of Bankone as it may require from 
time to time; and

M r . Wilfred H, Rommel, 
Assistant Director for 
Legislative Reference, 
Executive Office of the President, 
Office of Management and Budget, 
Washington, D . C .

Dear M r . Rommel 
Your Legislative Referral Memorandum dated July 22, 1970, 
requested the Board's views on a draft letter prepared by the 
Treasury to Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Committee on Banking 
and Currency, commenting on S . 3822, a bill "To provide insurance 
for member accounts in State and federally chartered credit: unions 
and for other purposes." 
Broadly stated, the purpose of S . 3822 is to extend to 
credit union share (deposit) accounts deposit insurance of the type 
that has been available for many years at banks and savings and 
loan institutions. 
The program is designed to be self-supporting 
through premium payments, but provision is made for limited borrowing 
from the Trea sury should that prove necessary. 
The bill would 
establish a $20,000 limit on insurance per account, the. same limit 
obtaining on bank and savings and loan accounts. 
The Treasury letter deals principally with technical 
aspects of the implementatitpn of deposit insurance, rather than 
with the desirability of such insurance. 
Most of these technical 
provisions, the proper premium rate and the most appropriate procedure 
for calculating interest charges on funds that might be borrowed from 
the Treasury, like the technical provisions of the bill itself, do not 
fall within the proper purview of the Board, and the Board takes no 
position on them. 

M r . Wilfred H. Rommel 
-2- 
August 4, 1970. 
Turning to the basic question of whether such insurance 
is desirable, the Board believes that it is. 
While credit unions 
play a limited role in channeling savings into economic u s e s — t h e i r 
share deposits now amount to about $15 b i l l i o n — t h e safety of 
savings in these i n s t i t u t i o n s and public confidence in their 
safety is nevertheless important. 
Accordingly, the Board endorses 
the general objectives of the proposed legislation. 
Very truly y o u r s , 
(signed) K e n n e t h A . K e n y o n

The Honorable William B . Camp 
Comptroller of the Currency 
Treasury Department 
W a s h i n g t o n , D . C .

Dear M r . Comptroller: 
This refers to M r . Pohn's letter of January 2 3 , 1970, to 
M r . Sanders regarding a "Combination Savings - Bond Plan" proposed 
to be offered by the American National Bank 6c Trust Company of 
South P a s a d e n a , St. Petersburg, F l o r i d a . 
Pursuant to the plan a customer will maintain w i t h the. 
bank a time deposit and in addition thereto purchase a participation 
in certain Government securities. 
The participation w i l l be subject 
to repurchase by the bank at the customer's option. 
The customer's 
combined yield w i l l exceed interest at the maximum Q-rate that could 
be paid if the funds were invested solely in a time deposit. 
The Board considers that the implementation of such a plan 
would involve an abuse of the exemption from Regulation Q relating 
to bank liabilities under repurchase agreements involving Government 
securities. 
Under the p l a n , the bank could promise to pay the 
maximum permissible rate on the portion of the customer's investment 
assigned to the time deposit and adjust the interest rate on the 
Participation in Government securities tied into the time deposit 
to whatever is necessary to provide the customer with the desired 
y i e l d on his investment. 
The bank's ability to pay interest to its 
customers for the use of their funds at a rate in excess of the 
applicable Q-rate would not be effectively restricted by the amount 
°f the bank's Government securities; by assigning all but a nominal 
amount of the customer's funds to the time deposit, one Government 
security could serve as the basis for paying any number of customers 
any desired r a t e . 
A c c o r d i n g l y , the Board has concluded that a bank liability 
a repurchase agreement involving Government securities that is 
tied in w i t h a bank liability on a deposit would be subject to 
Regulation Q as a deposit liability. 

The Honorable W i l l i a m B . Camp

Gentlemen: 
This refers to your letter dated May 26, 1970, requesting, 
as counsel for Barclay's B a n k , D . C . 0 . ("Barclay's Bank"), a ruling 
that § 3(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act does not prohibit Barclay s 
Bank from acquiring the stock of a new bank to be organized under the 
laws of the State of New Y o r k . 
Barclay's Bank Limited ("LIMITED"), a United Kingdom 
corporation, is a registered bank holding company because of its 
ownership of more than 25 per cent of the voting shares of two banks: 
(1) Barclay's B a n k , D . C . 0 . ("Barclay's Bank"), a United Kingdom 
corporation conducting a commercial banking business in the United 
States through two branch offices in New York City, and (2) Barclay's 
Bank of California ("BARCAL"), a commercial bank organized under the 
laws of California. 
Barclay's Bank also owns more than 25 per cent 
of the stock of B A R C A L . 
Deposits held by the Barclay's Bank branches 
in New York are larger than the deposits held by BARCAL in California. 
For reasons of administrative convenience, LIMITED proposes 
that its subsidiary, Barclay's B a n k , acquire all the shares of a new 
bank in New York to take over the domestic business presently handled 
by the Barclay's Bank branches in New York. 
LIMITED would file an 
application under § 3(a)(3) of the A c t for prior Board approval, 
since it would indirectly acquire the shares of the new bank. 
At the 
same time, Barclay's Bank would file an application under § 3(a)(1) 
to become a registered bank holding company, because of ownership of 
the stock of BARCAL and of the new bank in New York. 
Section 3(d) of the Act provides that: 
"(d) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
s e c t i o n , no application shall be approved under this 
section which will permit any bank holding company or 

2 2 7 1 
Simpson, Thatcher & Bartlett 
- 2 -
any subsidiary thereof to acquire, directly or in-
directly, any voting shares of, interest in, or all 
or substantially all of the assets of any additional 
bank located outside of the State in which the operations 
of such bank holding company's banking subsidiaries were 
principally conducted on the effective date of this 
amendment or the date on which such company became a bank 
holding company, whichever is later, unless the acquisition 
of such shares or assets of a State bank by an out-of-State 
bank holding company is specifically authorized by the 
statute laws of the State in which such bank is located, by 
language to that effect and not merely by implication. 
For the purposes of this section, the State in which the 
operations of a bank holding company's subsidiaries are 
principally conducted is that State in which total deposits 
of all such banking subsidiaries are largest." 
New York is the State in which the total deposits of L I M I T E D
1
s 
banking subsidiaries are largest (that is, deposits held by the New 
York branches of Barclay's Bank are larger than those held by B A R C A L ) . 
Accordingly, in view of § 3(d), L I M I T E D , either directly or indirectly 
through a subsidiary, may acquire additional banking subsidiaries 
only in New Y o r k . 
The question is whether § 3(d), which in the Board's view 
generally prohibits the formation as well as restricts the expansion 
of plural-State holding companies, prohibits Barclay's Bank from 
becoming a plural-State bank holding company under these circumstances. 
The Board is of the view that a plural-State holding company 
is not prohibited by § 3(d) from reorganizing itself by forming a 
subsidiary plural-State holding company whose expansion is restricted 
l n
 the same manner as that of the parent. 
However, since the theory 
upon which Barclay's Bank would be authorized to acquire a bank in 
New York would be predicated upon its status as a subsidiary of L I M I T E D , 
any approval granted it under § 3(a) would continue in effect only for 
so long as it retains that status. 
If it should cease to be a sub-
sidiary of L I M I T E D , its authority to continue to own shares of the 
proposed new bank in New York would terminate. 
Very truly y o u r s , 
(Signed) Kenneth A . Kenyon

Deputy Secretary.
