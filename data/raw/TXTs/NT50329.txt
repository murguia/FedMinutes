proposal would be put on notice of the Board's position through 
receipt of copies of the Board's letter to the law firm.

Policy record entry. With a memorandum from Mr. Broida dated 
September 11, 1968, there had been distributed a draft of policy 
record entry covering the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee 
on June 18, 1968. It was proposed to release the entry to the press 
on Monday, September 16, and the entry was now being submitted for 
final review by the Board. The draft had been approved by the Board 
on August 30, and no further suggestions had been received. 
The release of the entry to the press on September 16 was 
approved unanimously. 
Communications switch (Items 6 and 7). On June 21, 1968, 
pursuant to action on June 20, the Board sent a letter to President 
Heflin of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in his capacity as 
Chairman of the Presidents' Conference Committee on Inter-Bank 
Electronic Communications, approving his recommendation that negotia-
tions be initiated with Marshall Communications, Santa Ana, California, 
to obtain an automated communications switch for the Federal Reserve 
System. In a letter of September 9, 1968, Mr. Heflin requested the 
Board's concurrence in certain actions by the Conference of Presidents, 
set forth in detail in his letter, with respect to entering into a 
contract for the switch and acquisition of related equipment. 
The Board unanimously concurred in the actions of the Confer-
ence. A copy of the letter subsequently sent to Mr. Heflin is attached 
as Item No. 6. A copy of the press release issued on September 20, 
1968, is attached as Item No. 7.

Foreign credit restraint program. There had been distributed 
a memorandum dated September 11, 1968, in which Governor Brimmer out-
lined a foreign credit restraint program for 1969 that had been 
prepared as a basis for discussion in interagency groups. 
With respect to the bank program, Governor Brimmer recommended 
as follows: 
(1) Retain the ceiling of 103 per cent of the 1964 base for 
all banks using that ceiling in 1968. 
(2) Increase the ceiling for banks using the alternative 
computation to a full 2 per cent of December 31, 1967, total assets. 
(3) Retain the provision that any amount over the ceiling 
for 1967 be used for priority credits only, thus insuring that most 
of the additional leeway created by the 2 per cent provision would be 
used only to expand export financing. 
(4) While it was believed that the prohibition on new non-
export credits to developed countries of continental Western Europe 
was reasonable, the inclusion of equity investments in that prohibi-
tion had created difficult problems. Two alternative modifications 
were suggested: 
(a) Drop the prohibition against equity investments 
in continental Western Europe. The Board would 
then consider each case on its merits. 
Any 
approved investments would, of course, have to 
be made within the applicant's over-all ceiling. 
(b) Consider each investment on its merits, provided 
that it be made by a domestic subsidiary of an 
Edge or agreement corporation, formed for that

purpose, from funds borrowed abroad with a 
minimum maturity of three years. 
(5) Retain the requirement that repayments on long-term loans 
to continental Western Europe be deducted from the ceiling of the 
individual banks involved. 
(6) Retain the ceiling for short-term credits to developed 
countries of continental Western Europe at the end-1968 level, that 
is, 60 per cent of the end-1967 figure. 
(7) Other provisions of the 1968 guidelines would remain 
unchanged. 
The following were Governor Brimmer's recommendations with 
respect to nonbank financial institutions: 
(1) Retain the ceiling of 95 per cent of adjusted December 31, 
1967, holdings. 
(2) Make no change in the treatment of long-term credits 
(over ten years) to developing countries or in the exemption of IBRD 
bonds or credits guaranteed or participated in by the Export-Import 
Bank. 
(It was noted that any real curtailment of foreign lending 
and investing by nonbank financial institutions would require exten-
sion of the guidelines to Canada.) 
In commenting on the proposed over-all program, Governor 
Brimmer said that he advocated a status quo approach, primarily in 
order to reserve decisions regarding any possible major changes for 

O J U 
9/13/68 
-7-
the incoming Administration. 
He hoped the 2 per cent provision would 
make it possible for middle-sized banks to make a greater effort in 
the export field, and such a relaxation might quiet some of the 
allegations about the adverse effect of the bank program on export 
financing. 
There was some disposition at the Treasury to exempt all export 
credits, Governor Brimmer said. While the Board should listen to the 
arguments offered in support of that step, he would not be inclined to 
recommend it. However, it would be necessary to focus on that ques-
tion later. 
At the conclusion of his remarks, Governor Brimmer said he 
hoped that no basic changes would be made in the program in the next 
month or so. He also hoped that the staff would complete its analysis 
of the problem relating to "shell" facilities in the Bahamas, so that 
it would not be necessary to go into 1969 with that question unresolved. 
Governor Mitchell stated that his bias was strongly against the 
foreign credit restraint program. He would be in favor of any recom-
mendation for relaxation, but not in favor of any that went in the 
other direction. 
Governor Daane said he agreed with Governor Brimmer's general 
philosophy and approach. He was willing to accept the suggested pro-
gram as a basis for interagency discussions. 
There was some disagree-
ment among the other interested agencies regarding the Board's program, 

O
'
l 
9/13/68 
-8-
and it would be helpful to resolve that conflict if possible. 
The 
principal point of disagreement appeared to be the matter of exemption 
of export credits. As he understood it, the Treasury was not advocat-
ing a blanket exemption but merely some token. In any event, it would 
be well to listen with an open mind. 
Governor Brimmer said he understood that the Treasury's posi-
tion was not yet firm. A complete exemption of export credits had 
been considered, but he understood that a somewhat narrower proposal 
was now being developed. 
Governor Daane reiterated that he agreed with the proposed 
program as a basis for discussion. However, he had reservations about 
providing additional leeway in the absence of U.S. balance of payments 
equilibrium. 
Governor Brimmer replied that in the past few months he had 
become convinced that the restraint program had stifled the efforts 
of middle-sized banks that were just getting into foreign operations 
when the program was initiated. Therefore, he was willing to compro-
mise to the extent that additional leeway could reasonably be provided 
for those banks. While some risk was involved, he believed it was 
worth taking. 
Governor Maisel said it seemed to him that in interagency 
discussions the Board's representatives should press for a complete 
exposition of the various options available, and that when the new 

3439 
9/13/68 
-9-
Administration took office the Board should be prepared to recommend 
among those options. The program had been envisaged as a short-term 
measure, one in which long-term costs were traded for short-run gains. 
He believed indefinite continuation of the program would be counter-
productive, and thus the proposal to maintain the status quo raised 
major questions. Since the program had been in effect for four years, 
there should be a thorough analysis to see whether its rationale was 
any longer defensible. 
At the conclusion of the discussion there was general agreement 
that the program Governor Brimmer had outlined would be used as a basis 
for interagency discussion, although Governor Daane reiterated his 
misgivings regarding the degree of relaxation. Governor Maisel 
repeated his request that study be given to the alternatives that 
might be available, and it was understood that the staff would under-
take such a study. 
Governor Robertson joined the meeting during the foregoing 
dis cussion, and members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Kenyon, 
Molony, Cardon, Hexter, and Johnson withdrew at this point. 
Service with FNMA. 
In a letter to Chairman Martin dated 
September 11, 1968, the Special Assistant to the President pointed 
out that the Congress had adopted, in the Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Act of 1968, the President's recommendation that legislation be 
enacted to transfer the secondary market operation of the Federal 

9/13/68 
-10-
National Mortgage Association on an orderly basis to completely private 
ownership. The selection and appointment of a highly qualified interim 
board of directors to supervise this transfer would fulfill an impor-
tant national purpose, and the President would like Governor Sherrill 
to serve as a member. It would be satisfactory if such service 
terminated by April 1, 1969. 
In a memorandum dated September 10, 1968, the Board's General 
Counsel considered the question whether a member of the Board of 
Governors could lawfully serve as a director of the "new" Federal 
National Mortgage Association. In the memorandum, a copy of which 
has been placed in the Board's files, the General Counsel concluded 
that relevant provisions of the Federal Reserve Act should be inter-
preted as prohibiting a Board member from serving also as a director 
of a corporation such as FNMA if his duties as such would require so 
much time as substantially to diminish his ability to give full atten-
tion to the affairs of the Board of Governors. From the standpoint 
of policy, the General Counsel pointed out that the duties of a direc-
tor of FNMA might conflict with the duties of a Board member to some 
degree. Actions of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market 
Committee could affect materially the borrowing transactions of FNMA. 
An individual would have to participate in determining the timing and 
volume of Federal Reserve purchases of FNMA and other agency obliga-
tions while also determining the nature, amount, and timing of 
securities issues by FNMA.

Chairman Martin commented that Governor Sherrill was willing, 
though not anxious, to perform the service requested by the President. 
A limitation of six months had been negotiated, and he (Chairman Martin) 
was inclined to think that it would be difficult to demonstrate that 
more than a minimal amount of time would be required. 
Governor Maisel expressed the view that a decision should be 
made on policy rather than legal grounds. If it was clear that the 
Board of Governors ought or ought not to be represented on the board 
of FNMA, the legal question became secondary. For some time parties 
interested in FNMA had proposed amendment of the law to require that 
the Federal Reserve be represented on the board of FNMA. The argument, 
as he recalled, had been that FNMA provided a means of avoiding mone-
tary restriction in the housing field and that a liaison should be 
established. 
If such liaison was in fact important, he did not think 
that the question of length of service made any particular difference. 
Chairman Martin said there was a real question in his mind 
whether a member of the Board of Governors should be associated with 
FNMA on a permanent basis, and Governor Daane agreed. 
Governor Brimmer said he was convinced that a member of the 
Board of Governors should not serve at all as a director of FNMA. 
He 
would not consider it advisable for a Board member to serve with any 
Government agency whose function it was to channel credit to sectors 
of the economy. 

9/13/68 
-12-
Governor Daane inquired whether the Under Secretary of the 
Treasury was not also being asked to serve as a director of FNMA, and 
Chairman Martin replied in the affirmative. 
The President felt that 
an important transition problem was involved and that the services of 
both Governor Sherrill and Under Secretary Deming would be helpful. 
As matters stood, then, a member of the Board had been asked to per-
form this service. Apparently, if the time required was minimal, the 
law alone did not provide a clear answer. There might be some advan-
tage to the Federal Reserve in service by Governor Sherrill during 
the transition period on the ground that he would be informed as to 
what was involved in the transition, but it was a difficult question. 
Governor Maisel commented that there might be criticism if a 
Board member did not serve in response to Presidential request. 
On 
the other hand, a liaison would be established that it might be hard 
to discontinue in the future. Balancing those two questions, he felt 
that the decision was a close one. 
Governor Robertson expressed the view that it would be unwise 
for a Board member to serve in the capacity indicated because there 
apparently would be conflicts of the kind referred to by the General 
Counsel. On the other hand, he thought it would be inappropriate for 
the Board to take a firm position that any individual should not per-
form a service of this kind for a limited period in order to assist 
during a period of transition. There might be some benefits from the 

3443 
9/13/68 
-13-
knowledge that would be obtained. But over the long run such service 
would be inadvisable. 
Governor Daane agreed with those views, following which Gover-
nor Mitchell stated that he felt the situation would be an awkward one 
if conflicts of interest developed. Governor Brimmer pointed out that 
as a member of the Open Market Committee a Board member had intimate 
knowledge of credit policy plans. The question was whether a Board 
member could fulfill his duties to FNMA, even under an appointment of 
limited duration, if he refrained from using such knowledge. 
Governor Robertson stated that he would interpose no objection 
but felt that the dual service would be generally unwise and that the 
six-month understanding should be adhered to. He then withdrew from 
the meeting to keep another engagement. 
Governor Mitchell said he, too, thought the arrangement would 
be unwise, on the ground of conflict of interests. Generally speaking, 
he did not believe that there should be dual service unless the Con-
gress specifically provided therefor in the law. However, there had 
been a request from the President restricted to service for a short 
period, and he (Governor Mitchell) would be content merely to express 
his reservations, with the request that the record show that he thought 
the dual service would be unwise on the basis of conflict of interests. 
Governor Daane expressed the view that the best possible com-
promise had been worked out, short of rejecting the President's request.

He would want the record to show that as a Board member he thought it

would be unwise to go beyond rendering assistance during the transi-
tion period. 
Governor Maisel said that he would associate himself generally 
with Governor Mitchell's position. 
On the whole, he felt that the 
dual service would be unwise, but he would leave the decision to 
Governor Sherrill.

Governor Brimmer commented that he thought the Board had a 
responsibility to say explicitly that it thought the proposed action 
would not be proper. He would want to be recorded as feeling that the 
Board, rather than simply interposing no objection, should point out 
why it would be an unwise step. He would want to explain, given the 
long-run roles of the Board and the Open Market Committee, why it 
would be unwise for a Board member to serve in such a capacity. 
Chairman Martin replied that this view had already been 
communicated to the White House. 
On the other hand, Governor Sherrill 
was understandably reluctant to refuse the President's request. 
He 
(Chairman Martin) felt that a case could be made for assisting during 
the transition period and in view of the forthcoming change of Admin-
istrations. 
In such circumstances, the problem could be viewed some-
what differently than in a normal period. 
Secretary's Note: 
Governor Sherrill 
subsequently decided against accept-
ing the appointment. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Mr. Shute: 
This is in response to your letter of August 21, 1968, 
requesting the Board's views on the applicability of sections 16, 
20, 21, and 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 24, 377, 378, 
and 78) to the operation by First Wisconsin National Bank of a 
common trust fund known as "ICU Government Securities Program". 
It is understood that the fund is sponsored by CUNA 
International, Inc., to provide its member credit unions with a 
means for collective investment in Federal Government and agency 
obligations. 
Individual credit unions will participate in the 
plan by establishing individual trusts under a master trust 
created by ICU Securities Corporation, a subsidiary of CUNA, with 
the bank as trustee. First Wisconsin, as trustee, will retain 
the computer services of Chase Manhattan Bank, NA, to record the 
flow of money through the individual trust accounts and will 
retain Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., to provide the fund with 
investment advisory and safekeeping services in the New York 
market. 
It is further understood that the Comptroller of the 
Currency has granted conditional approval of the fund as a common 
trust fund, the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that the fund 
qualifies for tax benefits available to common trust funds, and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission has granted a conditional 
exemption for the fund from the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
You have advised that the Bureau of Federal Credit Unions is 
expected to rule that Federal credit unions may participate in 
the fund.

The Board has reviewed the materials submitted with your 
letter in the light of the purposes of the provisions of the Banking 
Act of 1933 cited above. It considers that the operation of the 
tund will be consistent with such purposes and, insofar as the 
Board's responsibilities with respect to such provisions of law are 
concerned, it has no objection to implementation of the program 
along the lines indicated above and more fully in the materials sub-
mitted with your letter. 
In this connection, it should be noted that section 16 of 
the Banking Act of 1933 amended paragraph "Seventh" of section 5136 
°f the Revised Statutes to limit the activities of national banks in 
the area of investing and dealing in securities. So far as the 
applicability of this statute to national banks is concerned, its 
interpretation is principally a matter for the Comptroller of the 
Currency rather than the Board. It should also be noted that the 
operation of common trust funds by banks has never been regarded as 
coming within the securities business as covered by section 21. 
However, the Board's position ha's been that, since section 21 of the 
Act is a criminal statute, the question whether a particular activity 
constitutes a violation of such provision is a matter within the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Justice and not the Board.

September 13, 1968. 
Dear Sir: 
As part of the System's defense planning, the Subcommittee 
on Emergency Operations recommended in a report dated Hay 28, 1965, 
that a special vault at the Chicago Reserve Bank be utilized for the 
storage of emergency supplies of currency for Federal Reserve Bank 
offices located in the central area of the United States and that 
large vaults be constructed at the Communications and Records Center 
in Culpeper, Virginia and at the Denver Branch of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City for storage of emergency supplies of currency for 
Reserve Bank offices in the eastern and western areas of the United 
States. The Conference of Presidents approved this recommendation 
on June 14, 1965, and subsequently the Board approved the provision 
of vault facilities for the storage of the currency. 
The storage of the emergency supply of notes at Chicago 
was completed in 1967. The Board would now like to proceed with 
the arrangements for storing supplies of currency in the vaults at 
Culpeper and Denver, both of which will soon be available for the 
purpose. 
A table showing the proposed storage is attached. The 
Initial shipments to Culpeper and Denver will be made out of excess 
supplies that have been accumulated at the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing, and subsequent shipments will be made from current produc-
tion at the Bureau. It is expected that all of the $1, $50, and $100 
denominations will be sent to the two locations by June 1969, and the 
$5, $10, and $20 denominations by the early part of 1970. 
In order that arrangements may be established with respect 
to the custody of the notes, the Board authorizes (a) the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and 
Atlanta, and the Federal Reserve Agent at each of these banks, to 

3443 
-2-
appoint, respectively, the Richmond Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve 
Agent at Richmond to hold the notes in joint custody at Culpeper, and 
(b) the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and San Francisco, and the 
Federal Reserve Agents at Dallas and San Francisco, to appoint, 
respectively, the Kansas City Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve 
Agent at Kansas City to hold the notes in joint custody at Denver. 
Suggested forms of powers of attorney are enclosed. The 
originals of the powers of attorney should be mailed to the Federal 
Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Agent as appropriate. It would 
be helpful if a copy of each is also forwarded to the Board. 
The Board has approved shipments of the currency under the 
Provisions of the Loss Sharing Agreement in amounts up to $50 million 
each. The shipments will be transported by Brink's Incorporated, 
pursuant to item 21 in the schedule attached to the contract of 
August 7, 1967. 
The Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations will 
communicate with the Assistant Federal Reserve Agents regarding the 
additional arrangements that will be made for shipping the notes. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Dear Mr. Heflin: 
Your letter of Spetember 9, 1968, advised that the 
Conference of Presidents had authorized the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Richmond to enter into a negotiated contract with . 
Marshall Communications, Santa Ana, California, for a communica-
tions switching system, and to proceed with the purchase, 
installation, and operation of the communications switching 
system on behalf of the Federal Reserve System. The total 
negotiated fixed price contract sum for the communications 
switching system was stated to be $2,249,250, and the total 
negotiated fixed price contract sum for five-year maintenance 
was stated to be $507,585. 
Your letter also advised that the Conference of Presi 
dents had authorized the Committee on Interbank Electronic 
Communications to arrange for the acquisition by lease of (a) up 
to 50 150-baud circuits and related terminal equipment, and 
(b) up to 15 2400-baud circuits and related terminal equipment. 
Final quantities and detailed specifications of circuits and 
terminal units would be fitted to the specific needs of the 
individual Federal Reserve offices. 
The Board concurs in the foregoing actions of the 
Conference of Presidents

For release in morning papers 
of Monday, September 23, 1968 
Item No. 7 
9/13/68 
September 20, 1968 
In a major preparatory step toward an electronic transfer system 
f
°r bank deposits and financial data in the 1970's, the Federal Reserve 
System announced today it has entered into a contract for a key segment 
a computerized network to speed up the movement of money, securities, 
a
nd economic statistics. 
A $2,756,835 contract with Marshall Communications, Santa Ana, 
California, calls for purchase, installation and maintenance for five 
years of a central communications switch to be located at Culpeper, 
Virginia. 
It constitutes another step in the System's program of adapting 
U
s
 operations to the latest developments in data processing and trans-
m
ission technology. 
The new automated communications grid will replace a more than 
1S 
-year-old nationwide leased wire network now used for the transfer of 
money, securities, and economic data among the Federal Reserve banks and 
^ e i r member commercial banks. 
Service is expected to begin late in 1969 or in early 1970. 
In 
E d i t i o n to the central communications switch at Culpeper, the ?rid will 
also require advanced communications equipment at the offices of the 
fi
oard of Governors in Washington, the 12 Federal Reserve banks, their 
branches, and the United States Treasury Department. 
Also in process are plans for early linkage of Federal Reserve 
b
ank offices with computerized facilities operated by or on behalf of 

o 4 t > 5 
-2-
commercial banks which hold membership in the Federal Reserve System or 
Participate in its clearing arrangements. 
A nationwide electronic grid capable of large volume and high 
accuracy will require uniformity in coding, transmission, formats, and 
Procedures. To develop the necessary uniformity, the Federal Reserve 
staff has been conferring and working with representatives of the American 
Bankers Association, the Bank Administration Institute (formerly NABAC) 
and others to ascertain the needed standards and to determine which lines 
°f development will yield the greatest benefit and service. 
The computerized operation will permit the gradual removal of 
limitations 
on the volume of transfers now imposed on the leased wire 
network by manual operations and outdated equipment. 
Money balances and data will be moved over the new system at 
speeds up to 40 times as fast as the present teletypewriter network. 
The 
volume potential of the computerized network will provide a capacity at 
least 12 times that now needed to handle the present operational load of 
the Federal Reserve. 
It is expected that several thousand additional 
Noney transfers daily will go by wire as connections with member banks 
are automated and existing mechanical limitations on use are overcome. 
A
t present, the teletypewriter system handles about 9,000 money transfers 
involving billions of dollars daily. 
The automation of deposit transfers between and within Federal 
Reserve offices will open the way for a completely electronic transfer 
system for a large portion of the country's money movements. 
Given a 

* * \ • 
-3-
Federal Reserve wire system with adequate capacity to respond immediately, 
member banks should find it desirable to automate their own communications 
-
w
ith the Federal Reserve Bank or Branch which serves them. This would 
enable them to transfer funds to or from any other member bank on a 
n 
computer-to-computer" basis. Thus, they would have the capacity to move 
money, at the direction of their customers, to or from any customer of any 
o t
h e r member bank, wherever located. 
Last June 25, the Federal Reserve System announced that it was 
beginning contract negotiations with Marshall Communications for the auto-
mated communications switch. 
This followed a System announcement last 
February 27 of plans to replace its nationwide leased wire network. 
The switch to be installed at Culpeper will be a M1000 Quad 
Communications Switching System which will be operated by the staff of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on behalf of the entire Federal Reserve 
System. Target date for the initial phase of installation is the end of 
1969. 
Terminals in the Federal Reserve offices will consist of tele-
typewriters; magnetic tape transmitter-receivers; and computers, depending 
u
Pon type and volume of traffic at specific points. Although text messages 
w
i l l be handled, most of the volume will consist of wire transfers of funds 
a
nd securities. 
Several types of circuits will be employed. 
Teletype equipment, 
in large measure duplicating the 81-D-l teletype system presently used by 
the Federal Reserve, will be served by 150-baud, fuli duplex lines. 

. 3457 
I! 
-4-
Transmission of magnetic tapes will utilize 2400-baud circuits. 
Data 
transfers originating in, or destined for, computers will use 2400-baud 
lines as well as certain special arrangements. Eight-level full ASCII 
code will be used. All Federal Reserve offices will be connected directly 
w
ith the central switch, although expansion plans provide for secondary 
collector" facilities elsewhere if traffic growth makes them desirable.
