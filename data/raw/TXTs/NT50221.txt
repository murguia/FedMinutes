Security program at Dallas (Item No. 9). After consideration 
of informat ion contained in a memorandum from the Division of Examina-
tions and the Division of Bank Operations dated February 9, 1968, expen-
ditures totaling approximately $391,000 for building alterations and 
equipment installations at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for the 
purpose of improving security were authorized. The project was in the 
main an outgrowth of the survey of the protection function at the head 
office conducted by the U.S. Secret Service in April 1966, and the 
proposed expenditure had been approved by the Board of Directors of 
the Dallas Bank. A copy of the telegram sent to the Dallas Bank is 
attached as Item No. 9. 
Proposed foreign investments. Mr. Dahl summarized a problem 
that had come to light following the Board's recent action suspending 
the general consent provisions of Regulation K (Corporations Engaged 
in Foreign Banking and Financing under the Federal Reserve Act). 
The 
Internat ional Finance Corporation had informed him that, in coopera-
tion with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
and a group of banks, it had been sponsoring the formation of a devel-
opment bank in Korea. The negotiations had been under way for some 
time and were now approaching a conclusion. The project would involve 
substantial investments by the International Finance Corporation, the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Korean 
Government, and several foreign banks. Also included among the partic-
ipants were four U.S. banks: 
Bank of America 
National Trust and 

2/12/68 
-4-
Savings Association, San Francisco; United California Bank, Los Angeles 
First National City Bank, New York; and Irving Trust Company, New York. 
They had agreed in principle to subscribe to equity securities of the 
development bank in amounts ranging from $125,000 to $175,000 each, 
and it had been their intention to acquire the shares under the general 
consent provisions of Regulation K. The contracts were to be signed 
this coming Wednesday, with final payment scheduled for the end of 
February. In the circumstances, Mr. Dahl recommended that he be autho-
rized to inform the International Finance Corporation and the U.S. 
banks concerned that the Board would be prepared to approve the pro-
posed investments once the applications were filed, thus enabling the 
signing of the contracts on Wednesday. 
After discussion, Mr. Dahl was authorized to inform the parties 
concerned that the Board would be prepared to approve the necessary 
applications when they were filed. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: 
Governor Robertson 
today approved on behalf of the Board a 
request from Paul W . Knight, Electronic 
Accounting Machine Operator in the Divi-
sion of Data Processing, for permission 
to work as security officer for TRW Sys-
tems, Inc., on a part-time basis. 
On February 12, 1968, action was taken 
on behalf of the Board under delegated 
authority as indicated by the following 
letter, a copy of which is attached under 
the item number indicated:

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System approves the establishment by First Pennsylvania 
Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
of a branch at 379-393 North Main Street, Doylestown 
Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, provided the branch 
is established within one year from the date of this 
letter. 
In considering this application, it has been 
determined that your bank's management and capital 
position are satisfactory, and that the proposed branch 
would serve the convenience and needs of the community, 
particularly those of your present customers who reside 
in the area. In addition, it is not believed that 
establishment of the branch would tend to create an un-
desirable competitive situation. 
Very truly yours,

Gentlemen: 
Reference is made to your letter of April 26, 1966, 
addressed to Vice President Nosker of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond, advising of the purchase of 60,000 shares of Deltec 
Panamerica, S.A. ("Deltec"), Nassau, Bahamas, pursuant to the gen-
eral consent provisions of Section 211.8(a) of Regulation K. 
It is understood that Vice President Nosker advised your 
Corporation of the Board of Governors' determination in a prior 
case that investment by Edge Corporations in Deltec was not per-
missible due to the activities of Frederic H. Hatch & Co., Inc. 
("Hatch"), New York, New York, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which 
was engaged in the securities business in the United States. 
The Board has received applications from two other Edge 
Corporations for permission to invest in Deltec and, in view of 
the change in activities of Hatch in the United States, has granted 
consent to the investments. 
Accordingly, the Board will interpose no objection to 
the continued holding of the shares of Deltec by your Corporation 
which were acquired during the first quarter of 1966, at a cost of 
US$187,200. Your continued holding of such shares is subject to 
the understanding that Deltec's activities in the United States 
through Hatch will be essentially limited to (1) the private place-
ment of foreign debt obligations or participations therein rep-
resenting the investments or extensions of credit of Deltec or its 
subsidiaries, (2) the execution of orders to buy and sell securities 
in the United States for the account and risk of customers abroad, 
(3) the placing of orders to buy and sell securities abroad for 

Wachovia International 
Investment Corporation

the account and risk of United States customers, (4) trading for 
Hatch's own investment account in domestic or foreign securities, 
and (5) other activities which would be permissible if Deltec and 
its subsidiaries were organized as one corporation under section 
25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act. The continued holding of such 
shares is also subject to the conditions that Deltec, through Hatch 
or otherwise, shall not take any action that would constitute being 
engaged in the business of underwriting or dealing in securities in 
the United States and that your Corporation will make available to 
the Board such information about the activities of Deltec in the 
United States and elsewhere as the Board may from time to time require. 
The foregoing is based upon the further understanding that 
the investment, combined with other foreign loans and investments of 
your Corporation and Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, does not cause 
the total of such loans and investments to exceed the guidelines 
established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect 
and that due consideration is being given to the priorities contained
