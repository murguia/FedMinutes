Item No. 
Letter to The Detroit Bank and Trust Company,

Detroit, Michigan, approving the establishment 
of a branch at 12310 Morang Street. 
Letter to the Bureau of the Budget reporting

on a proposed bill to amend the Commodity 
Exchange Act. 
Letter to the Bureau of the Budget reporting

on enrolled bill S. 714, to amend section 22(g) 
of the Federal Reserve Act relating to loans to 
executive officers by member banks of the Fed-
eral Reserve System, and to amend the Federal 
Credit Union Act. 
With respect to Item No. 3, Governor Robertson suggested and 
the Board agreed that the draft presented by the Legal Division be 
revised to omit the statement that the Board had no objection to enact-
ment of the bill, to point out that the Board remained of the view that 
the powers available for regulating commodity trading should include 
at least discretionary authority to prescribe minimum margin require-
ments (a view that had been expressed regarding an earlier bill on which 
the Board reported to the Bureau under date of January 28, 1965), and 
that otherwise the Board had no comment on the proposal. 
Report on S. 1956 (Item No. 5). There had been distributed a 
memorandum dated June 28, 1967, from Mr. Cardon relating to a request 
from Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee 
for a report on S. 1956, a bill to extend for two years the Act of 
September 21, 1966 (Public Law 89-597), which granted new authority to 
the financial regulatory agencies in connection with maximum interest

and dividend rates, and to the Federal Reserve with respect to reserve 
requirements and open market operations in agency issues. The memo-
randum indicated that Senator Sparkman might wish to report the bill 
without a hearing if the Board supported the bill or had no objection 
to it. 
In the preparation of a report the staff sought guidance as to 
whether the Board wished (1) to support the bill as introduced, (2) to 
recommend an amendment that would repeal the "sense of Congress" pro-
vision in section 1 of the 1966 Act (which provides that the financial 
regulatory agencies in implementing their powers under the law "shall 
i 
take action to bring about the reduction of interest rates to the 
maximum extent feasible in the light of prevailing money market and 
general economic conditions"), (3) to recommend an amendment that would 
repeal section 7 of the Act, thereby making the law permanent rather 
than extending it on a temporary basis, or (4) to take some other posi-
tion. The memorandum recommended that the Board support the bill as 
introduced. 
In April the Board considered a Treasury draft bill that would 
make permanent the 1966 Act, but no Board position had been reached on 
the general question whether to favor permanent legislation of this 
character and, specifically, whether the "sense of Congress" provision 
in section 1 of the 1966 Act should be retained. 
At today's meeting Governor Robertson recalled that he had pre-
viously expressed the view that there was danger in a temporary extension 

- c b b J I 
6/29/67 
-4-
of the legislation in a form that would include the "sense of Congress" 
provision. 
It had been his view that the Home Loan Bank Board and 
others could use such a provision to exert pressure upon the Board of 
Governors to reduce interest rates when the Board might not consider 
that appropriate. However, Mr. Cardon had now convinced him that the 
provision might be interpreted to call for as low interest rates as 
possible in a given situation without producing inflation. 
In this 
connection he noted that the provision applied to both fiscal and 
monetary actions. He would hope that the report on S. 1956 would 
indicate that the Board would prefer permanent legislation but would 
not oppose the temporary extension of the 1966 Act. 
Governor Daane commented that he personally would not prefer 
permanent legislation unless the "sense of Congress" provision was 
deleted. An extension of the present legislation on a two-year basis 
now seemed to him the best solution. 
Governor Brimmer said that it was his understanding that there 
were divisions of opinion in the Senate Banking and Currency Committee 
as to whether or not hearings should be held. It appeared likely, 
however, that there would be hearings before the House Banking and 
Currency Committee. Accordingly, he expressed the view that the Board 
should take a position that would not encourage hearings in the Senate 
but would still afford the Board an opportunity to seek modification 
of the bill if called upon to testify before the House. Therefore, he 

2662 
6/29/67

suggested that the report contain a definite statement that the Board 
favored an extension of the legislation for a two-year period. 
Governor Daane expressed agreement with this suggestion, indi-
cating that it appeared to represent the safest line of action. 
Governor Robertson felt that a statement in favor of a two-
year extension would preclude subsequent argument by the Board for 
permanent legislation, and he suggested that the Board simply say that 
it favored the proposal. 
Chairman Martin remarked that such a stance would enable the 
Board to move in whichever direction subsequent Board consensus devel-
oped on the questions at issue. It seemed to him that there were 
certain advantages to be gained by a limited extension of the existing 
legislation, which was in a more or less experimental stage. 
It was thereupon agreed that a report should be drafted along 
the lines suggested by Governor Robertson. A copy of the letter sub-
sequently sent to Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Banking and Currency 
Committee is attached as Item No. 5. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Dear Mr. Rommel: 
This is in response to your request of June 21, 1967, for 
the views of the Board on a draft bill proposed by the Department of 
Agriculture to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. Unlike the draft 
bill on which the Board commented in its letter of January 28, 1965, 
to Mr. Phillip S. Hughes, the present draft would not provide authority 
for the Secretary to set margin requirements for trading in commodities 
whenever there is reason "to believe there is danger of manipulation, 
sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price 
of any commodity, excessive speculation", or the like. The Board 
remains of the view that the powers available for regulating commodity 
trading should include at least discretionary authority to prescribe 
minimum margin requirements. 
Otherwise, the Board has no comment on 
the proposal. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

Secretary.

Dear Mr. Rommel: 
This is in response to your memorandum of June 27, 
1967, requesting the views of the Board of Governors on the 
enrolled bill, S. 714, "To amend section 22(g) of the Federal 
Reserve Act relating to loans to executive officers by member 
banks of the Federal Reserve System, and to amend the Federal 
Credit Union Act . . . 
The Board's comments are limited 
to the first section of the bill because section 2, relating 
to Federal credit unions, is outside the area of the Board's 
responsibility. 
The Board is in favor of the proposed legislation 
and recommends that the enrolled bill be approved by the 
President. 
Sincerely yours 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr

Dear M r . Hirschler: 
As requested in your letter of June 22, 1967, the Board of 
Governors approves the appointment of M r . Hubert P . Franzel as a 
Federal Reserve Agent's Representative at the Seattle Branch to succeed 
Mr. Parker R . Smith. 
This approval is given with the understanding that M r . Franzel 
will be solely responsible to the Federal Reserve Agent and the Board of 
Governors for the proper performance of his duties, except that, during 
the absence or disability of the Federal Reserve Agent or a vacancy in 
that office, his responsibility will be to the Assistant Federal Reserve 
Agent and the Board of Governors. 
When not engaged in the performance of his duties as Federal 
Reserve Agent's Representative, M r . Franzel may, with the approval of 
the Federal Reserve Agent and the Vice President in charge of the Seattle 
Branch, perform such work for the Branch as will not be inconsistent with 
his duties as Federal Reserve Agent's Representative. 
It will be appreciated if M r . Franzel is fully informed of 
the importance of his responsibilities as a member of the staff of the 
Federal Reserve Agent and the need for maintenance of independence from 
the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these responsibilities. 
It is noted from your letter that with the approval of this 
appointment by the Board of Governors, M r . Franzel will execute the 
usual Oath of Office which will be forwarded to the Board of Governors. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
