Applications of Barnett National Securities Corporation. 
There had been distributed a memorandum dated August 15, 1968, from 
the Division of Supervision and Regulation and other pertinent papers 
in connection with applications of Barnett National Securities Corpo-
ration, Jacksonville, Florida, to acquire 80 per cent or more of the 
outstanding voting shares of (1) The Munroe and Chambliss National 
Bank of Ocala, and (2) Munroe and Chambliss National Bank of East 
Ocala, both of Ocala, Florida. The staff and Reserve Bank recommenda-
tions were favorable. 
Following comments by Mr. Burton in supplementation of the 
material that had been distributed, the applications were approved 
u
nanimously, with the understanding that appropriate orders and a 
statement would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Members of the staff other than Messrs. Holland and Hart, 
Miss Carmichael, and Miss Wolcott then withdrew from the meeting. 
Guidelines for officer salaries (Item No. 6). With a memoran-
dum dated August 27, 1968, from the Board's Committee on Organization, 
Compensation, and Building Plans, there had been distributed a draft 
o f
 letter to the Chairmen and Presidents of all Federal Reserve Banks 
e
stablishing general guidelines for use by the Boards of Directors of 
the respective Banks in requesting approval of proposed changes in the 
s
alaries of officers other than Presidents and First Vice Presidents 
the year beginning January 1, 1969. The letter also specified 
r \

the salary structure for officers that would be applicable to Reserve 
Banks other than New York. 
Following a discussion during which Governor Mitchell clerified 
several points covered in the letter and certain editorial changes were 
agreed upon, unanimous approval was given to a letter in the form 
attached as Item No. 6. 
Miss Wolcott then withdrew from the meeting. 
Officer salaries at Cleveland. Governor Mitchell referred to 
a letter dated August 14, 1968, from Chairman Clay of the Federal 
Re serve Bank of Cleveland stating that the Bank's Board of Directors 
recommended that the annual salary of First Vice President Walter H. 
MacDonald be increased by $4,000 to $33,000 and that the salary of 
Vice President and General Economist Maurice Mann be increased by 
$4,000 to $32,500, both changes to be effective September 1, 1968. In 
the l e tter Chairman Clay mentioned the quality of the work performed 
by both Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Mann and noted that Mr. Mann had received 
a
n offer from a commercial bank. He stated also that, while Mr. 
MacDonald would not normally be eligible for a salary increase at this 
time, the directors considered that the recommended increase was well 
justified and noted that it would have the effect of maintaining an 
a
Ppropriate alignment among officer salaries at the Bank. An interim 
r e
ply to the Reserve Bank's letter had indicated that it would be pref-
erable to hold the recommended increases in abeyance until the Board 

33 (M 
8/28/68 
-5-
of Governors had concluded its review of the salary structure for 
Reserve Bank officers generally. 
Now that the review, for officers other than Presidents and 
First Vice Presidents, had been completed, Governor Mitchell suggested 
that it would seem appropriate to consider the proposals of the Cleve-
land Reserve Bank, both of which he had discussed with Chairman Clay 
and President Hickman. Governor Mitchell went on to say that he con-
sidered Mr. Mann exceptionally well qualified and that the proposed 
increase for him seemed consistent with the new salary guidelines. 
Question was raised whether action on the two proposals should 
be postponed until the salaries for Presidents and First Vice Presi-
dents had been reviewed. In this connection, Governor Brimmer stated 
that President Hickman had a general preference for making the two 
increases effective at the same time but would probably be willing to 
wait a reasonable period pending the outcome of the salary structure 
review. In his own view, Governor Brimmer considered that it would 
be unwise to increase the salary of any First Vice President until the 
review had been completed. 
At the end of the discussion it was understood that Governor 
Mitchell would check with Chairman Clay as to the need for adjusting 
Mr. Mann's salary prior to the completion of the review. 
The meeting then adjourned.

cne Board of Governors is required for investments of this type by 
BAI and that you have brought to the attention of management of BAI

d
ate of this letter. 
The Board's consent to the purchase and holding of shares 
FINABAI by BAI is granted subject to the following conditions: 
(1) That BAI shall not hold, directly or indirectly, any 
shares of stock of FINABAI if FINABAI at any time fails 
to restrict its activities to those permissible to a 
corporation in which a corporation organized under Sec-
tion 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act could, with the 
consent of the Board of Governors, purchase and hold 
stock, or if FINABAI establishes any branch or agency 
or takes any action or undertakes any operation in 
Luxembourg or elsewhere, in any manner, which at the 
time would not be permissible to your Corporation;

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System grants 
its permission to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Associa-
tion ("B of A"), San Francisco, California, pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, to establish a branch in 
Montevideo, Uruguay, and to operate and maintain said branch subject 
to the provisions of such Section and of Regulation M . 
It is understood that this branch will result from the 
conversion of your subsidiary, Banco del Este, S.A., into a branch 
of B of A , through the merger of said subsidiary into B of A. 
Unless the branch is actually established and opened for 
business as a branch of B of A on or before September 1, 1969, all 
rights granted hereby shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the 
authority hereby granted will automatically terminate on that date. 
Please inform the Board of Governors through the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, when this branch is opened for business as a 
branch of B of A , furnishing information as to its exact location. 
The Board should also be promptly informed of any future change in 
location of the branch. 
The foregoing permission is granted subject to any neces-
sary approval by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
As you are aware, with respect to the establishment of 
foreign branches, funds provided by home office (whether in the form 
of allocated capital, advances, or otherwise) should be regarded as 
foreign assets for purposes of the foreign credit restraint effort. 
In view of the Board's concern with minimizing the impact of foreign 

3313 
Bank of America National Trust 
and Savings Association

investments on the balance of payments, the foregoing permission 
is given with the understanding that in the conduct of the branch's 
operations maximum reliance will be placed on resources obtained 
outside the United States. Accordingly, it is understood that any 
additional investment required will be made within the guidelines 
established under the foreign credit restraint effort now in effect 
as they apply to the foreign lending and investment activities of 
your bank, Bamerical International Financial Corporation, and Bank 
of America, New York, and that due consideration is being given to 
the priorities contained therein. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Elizabeth L. Carmichael

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) 
Dear Sir: 
As in recent years, the Board of Governors has established 
general guidelines for use by the Boards of Directors at the Federal 
Reserve Banks in requesting approval for proposed changes in officers' 
salaries, other than the President and First Vice President. 
The Board has established the following general guidelines 
to be used for requesting approval for proposed changes for the year 
beginning January 1, 1969: 
1. Annual Review. Except for increases incident to promotions, 
requests for apprpval of salary changes should be made at 
the time of the annual review; at other times, only under 
unanticipated circumstances. 
2. Basis of Increase and Rate of Progression. 
Increases should 
not be automatic; in frequency and amount they should reflect 
relative merit and competitive conditions. 
3. Selectivity. To maintain selectivity, and subject to excep-
tions below, the Board will not ordinarily approve increases 
for more than 50 per cent of the officer staff at each Reserve 
Bank in any given year. The merit basis for increases should 
not be avoided by automatic increases in larger amounts at 
two or three year intervals. 
4. Exceptions . 
a. Promotional increases are excluded from the 50 per cent 
calculation. To be eligible, a promotion must include 
a concurrent change in the level of responsibilities 
and, ordinarily, in the title of the individual. 

- 2 -
*;-> $ rr 
O O J L O 
b. The 50 per cent guideline will be waived whenever there 
is a change in the official salary structure or whenever 
there is a change to accommodate a shift in the level of 
community salaries. In either case Board approval is 
required and increases for "structural" reasons should 
be identified as such, apart from merit increases. 
The Board of Governors has also considered the views of the 
Presidents of the Reserve Banks on matters relating to salary adminis-
tration at the Reserve Banks which were included in Governor Mitchell's 
letter of July 18, 1968, and the Committee on Organization, Compensation, 
and Building Plans has met with the members of the Committee on Personnel 
of the Presidents' Conference to discuss these views. As a result, the 
following additional guidelines have been set by the Board: 
1. Basic Salary Structure. The official salary structure 
applicable to the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, with 
the exception of New York, will be: 
Class 
Title 
Minimum 
Maximum 
A . 
Senior Vice Presidents 
$24,000 
$37,500 
B. 
Vice Presidents 
18,000 
32,000 
C. 
Assistant Vice Presidents 
14,000 
24,000 
D. 
Junior Officers 
12,000 
18,000 
These titles and ranges are set with the understanding that 
a
ny proposed use of the title (^f Senior Vice President will be submitted 
to the Board of Governors for its consideration; that there is no objec-
tion to the use of special titles (for example, Economists, Examiners, 
Counsel, Auditors, etc.); and that the use of the Class D category is 
optional. 
The questions raised in parts III and IV of Governor Mitchell's 
letter are still under review, subject to receipt of a letter from 
Chairman Galusha of the Committee on Personnel with regard to these 
questions. 
Salaries of officers proposed for the year beginning January 1, 
1969, should be submitted to the Board of Governors not later than 
November 15, 1968. The Board believes that, as in the past, it would 
be mutually helpful if its Committee on Organization, Compensation,and 
Building Plans (comprised of Governor Mitchell as Committee Chairman, 
a
nd Governors Maisel and Brimmer) could discuss with each President 
Preliminary salary and promotional plans before the Bank submits its 
Proposals formally to the Board of Governors for action. 

In recent years most of the Presidents have discussed promo-
tions contemplated in the ensuing year as a result of retirements, known 
separations, or restructuring of operations. The Board believes this 
policy is helpful to its consideration of merit raises and requests each 
Bank to include such information with its presentation this year. 
The Committee would also like to be advised, at the time of 
the discussion of officer salaries, of plans your Bank may have for 
building projects of a major nature during the next five years. 
It will be appreciated if each President will schedule his 
meeting with the Committee for the purpose of discussing salaries, 
promotions, and building projects prior to November 15, 1968. 
This letter is being sent to the Chairman and the President 
of each Federal Reserve Bank. 
Very truly yours, 
R 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.
