The required supply of copies of the following forms have been, 
o r
 soon will be, forwarded to your Bank under separate cover for use of 
S t
ate member banks for submitting reports as of the next Call date. A 
copy 0 f each form is enclosed for your information. 
Form FR 105 (Call 210 revised December 1973), Report of 
Condition of State member banks. 
Form FR 1.05 Schedule K, Trading Account Securities and 
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under 
Agreements to Resell. 
Supplement to Form FR 105, Supplemental Information on 
Loan Commitments. 
Supplement to Form FR 105, Supplemental Information on 
Large Denomination Time Deposits. 
Supplement to Form FR 105, Supplemental Information on 
Standby Letters of Credit. 
Form FR 105e (revised December 1973), Publisher's copy 
of Report of Condition of State member banks for joint 
State and Federal Reserve requirements. 

4983 
- 2 -
Form FR 105e-l (revised September 1973), Publisher's 
copy of Report of Condition of State member banks. 
The Report of Condition and related Publisher's copies have 
b
een amended to include an inset for the amount of direct lease financing 
a
t Item 13, All other assets, on the face of the report. The new item 
corresponds to the item already used in national bank reports for a number 
years. Reports of insured ncnmember banks will not include the new 
item for this Call but will probably be added for 1974 Calls. 
Additional 
requirements for publication of the amount of outstanding standby letters 
credit on Publisher's copies are noted below. 
Schedule K will continue to be used for reporting the breakdown 
trading account securities by broad type of security and the breakdown 
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
a c
cording to the other party to the transactions. This information is 
needed to maintain statistical series relating to totals of securities, 
ky type, held by commercial banks. 
Supplemental information on bank loan commitments will again be 
required. The form and substance of the supplement and banks required to 
report are the same as for the June 1973 report. A list of banks in your 
district required to report was forwarded to your Bank earlier. Note 
tll
at t h e 
l i s t 
o f banks is substantially the same as those required to 
r e
port for the June Call. Banks reaching $100 million in deposits after 
December 1972 and banks reporting in the regular monthly loan commitments 
S u
rvey are not required to report. National banks over $100 million in 

- 3 -
4984 
deposits will also be required to report on the same basis by the 
Comptroller. As in the June 1973 Call, insured nonmember banks will 
not be required to report on the loan commitments supplement but will 
b
e monitored through the supervisory process. 
As for other recent Calls, special reports of loans to executive 
officers will be required. No standard form has been devised for these 
reports. 
Beginning with the December 1973 Call, banks will no longer be 
required to submit reports of affiliates on form FR 220 or to publish 
s u
ch reports using form FR 220a. The requirements for these reports have 
keen waived by the Board for all State member banks. 
A special supplement to obtain information on standby letters 
°f credit outstanding at State member banks will be required for this Call. 
T h
e amounts of such letters of credit outstanding at some banks have been 
o f
 continuing concern to the supervisory agencies for some time. Note 
t b a
t , as stated on the form itself, the information reported is required 
t o
 be interlined on the Publisher's copy and is subject to the publication 
requirements of form FR 105e and FR 105e-l. This information will also 
b
e collected from national and insured state banks. National banks will 
.
 be
- required to publish the information. The item is on the face of the 
N a
tional bank Call forms rather than in a supplement but will not be 
tabulated with Call data. 
Another supplemental schedule to form FR 105 is required to 
°
b
tain information on large denomination time deposits. This information 

- 4 -
43S5 
°n all time deposits in denominations over $100,000 at insured commercial 
banks, exempt from Regulation Q } is needed to assess the behavior of 
such deposits for regulatory and monetary policy purposes. This informa-
tion will also be collected from national and insured banks. Copies of 
the state member bank form for this supplement may be delayed but will 
he forwarded later. Your Bank will be advised by telegram of developments. 
There will be no change in the instructions for keypunching or 
Preliminary processing of Report of Condition forms. Provision for includ-
ing direct lease financing data had already been made under existing instruc-
tions. Preliminary processing of supplemental information 011 loan commit-
ments will follow the procedures used for June reports. 
Separate keypunch-
ing and preliminary processing instructions for the time deposits supple-
ment will be forwarded to your Bank soon. It is not planned that the 
Reserve Banks will be required to do any keypunching on the letters of 
c
redit supplement. Instructions for editing and forwarding this supplement 
w
ill be provided later. 
Very truly yours,

Proposed acquisition of shares of the successor organization is

 Board has considered the application and all comments received in 
I i 8 h t
 of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant, the fifth largest banking organization in Virginia,

 Virginia banking organizations. 
Bank ($5.6 m i l l i o n in d e p o s i t s ) is the ninth largest of 15 
b

c
ne Roanoke banking market, which is approximated by the Roanoke 
and controls .8 per cent of deposits in that market. Bank's main 
°ffiCe

 only branch are located in Botetourt County, which comprises the 
^theast

 P
a r
t of the Roanoke SMSA. Although Applicant's acquisition of 
B a n k
 Would < 
a
 increase its share of market deposits by only .8 percentage 
» this would aggravate the high level of deposit concentration in the 
he four largest banking organizations presently control over 85 
P 6 r c
*nt of 
^ 
or market deposits). Furthermore, Applicant's lead bank, First 
atioiia] v 
Exchange Bank ("Exchange Bank") controls 43.6 per cent of total market 
S o s i t s 
a n
d is clearly the predominant banking organization in the Roanoke 
second and third largest banks in the market are less than 
^
U 
anH 
<*na one-third the size of Exchange Bank, controlling 18.6 per cent 
13.6 
P
e
r cent of market deposits, respectively. Exchange Bank is 
c t
ed from branching into Botetourt County; however, Exchange Bank has 
^nki

It appears that Exchange Bank derives a significant dollar 
X * 
o t . 
.loans and deposits from Bank's primary service area. Although 
and deposits derived from Bank's primary service area represent 
s 
La
tiv0i, 
small percentage of Exchange Bank's total loans and deposits, 
b e
n t , respectively, approximately 110 and 87 per cent of the 

_ 4931

t o t a
l loans and deposit dollar volume that Bank derives from its own primary 
S e r
vice area. Further, Bank derives approximately 8 per cent of its deposits 
aric
* 4 per cent of its loans from Exchange Bank's service area. Accordingly, 
n
 ^ e basis of these and other facts of record, the Board concludes that 
^ i f leant e x i s t ^ n g competition would be eliminated upon consummation of 
t h i s
 Proposal. 
The acquisition of Bank by a banking organization not presently 
^Presented in this part of the Roanoke SMSA banking market, without the 
p e r
centag e of deposits that Applicant controls in this market, could have 
9 k 
G r i e
ficial effect on competition in this area. The Board therefore finds 
it i s n ^ i y that the proposed acquisition would have significant 
V e r
s e effects on the relevant banking market by increasing deposit con-
a t
ion and removing a banking alternative therein, by eliminating 
i s t i r
*g competition, and by foreclosing the possibility that Bank could 
as a potential means of entry by other banking organizations not 
e s e
ntly represented in the market. Accordingly, competitive considerations 
te
<lUir 
r e
 denial of this application unless the anticompetitive effects of 
the rxv. 
Proposal are outweighed by benefits to the public in meeting the con-
V e t
Uen 
n c
e and needs of the communities to be served. 
The financial and managerial resources of Applicant and its 
and Bank, are satisfactory, and future prospects appear favor-
T
hus, banking factors are consistent with approval but provide no 
A C
ant support for such action. There is no evidence in the record to 
s t
 that the banking needs of the communities to be served are not

The facts of record reflect that, should Applicant consummate the 
Proposed acquisition, Bank will be a separate corporation with its own 
capital stock and a loan limit based on such capital stock; that Bank and 
Applicant's lead bank, as national banks* would be subject to the same 
r e
8ulatory authorities; that Bank will be managed by its own officers; that 
bank's board of directors will be generally separate and independent from 
tVi i.

 boards of Applicant and of Applicant's subsidiaries; and that Bank 
maintain its own separate books of account, issue its own distinctive 
c
hecks, and use its own stationery. Applicant represents that officers and

Ployees of its other banking subsidiaries will not perform services directly

Persons who are customers only of Bank, nor exercise management or 
S u
Pervision over any aspect of the business of Bank. Applicant represents

 their reading of the words "subsidiary corporation", contained

holding companies. The definition of the phrase "subsidiary 
c

instruction of § 45-443 T.C.A. is not tenable. A "subsidiary

Ernest 
by 21

Per cent. Although much of this growth is attributable to Bank, 
^PPlicant has acquired a number of firms during this period, including 
commercial banks and two consumer finance companies. 
Applicant's 
^banking activities include leasing, factoring, and commercial financing. 
a
PPears that Applicant is a well-managed, growing (through both 
Eternal and internal expansion), profitable, and significant leader 
commercial banking and finance in the United States. 
Advance was and is a profitable enterprise and one of the

^ States and the District of Columbia where its loans originate from. 
addition, at offices in Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan, 
Advance originated in 1969 (the last full year preceding acquisition) 
instruction loans as well as loans on income-producing property not only 
in TI 
iilinois and Michigan, but also in California, Oklahoma, Texas, 
l 4
°
n t a n a
, and other distant States. These same offices, in 1971, 
V e r e
 brokering long-term loans on income-producing properties located 
throughout the United States and in Canada. 
In 1969 Advance was the fourth largest mortgage company

 the U n i t e d S t a t e s b a s e d u p o n a s e r v i c i n g v o l u m e of a p p r o x i m a t e l y

D l 0 r t
8age loans of approximately $282 million, of which $31 million 
Ve r e 
mortgages on income-producing property, and $22.6 million were 
°
n
struction loans. Also in 1969, Advance warehoused mortgage loans 
h a v i l
*g a total volume of $79.6 million. In 1971, the first full year 
0 w
ing subject acquisition, Advance's originations of mortgage 
a n s
 totalled $450 million. Its servicing volume had increased to 
"illion and it was then warehousing mortgage loans totalling 
million. This increased activity elevated Advance to the rank 
of t h 
n e
 third largest mortgage company in the United States.

^reover, based on data provided by Applicant, it appears that 
A d

i n w
hich it originates loans on 1-4 family residences as well as in 
e
 national markets for the origination of construction loans and 
^•°ans on apartments and other income-producing properties.£/ 
Applicant, through its banking subsidiaries, originates 
family residential mortgage loans, primarily in New York State, and 
instruction 
loans and loans on apartments and other income-producing 
Properties in many parts of the country. Applicant does not service

for others; nor does Applicant own a mortgage banking 
S U b s i d
i a r y other than Advance. At the time of subject acquisition, 
B a n
k was Applicant's only commercial banking subsidiary. In 1969, 
B a
nk originated $47 million of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, 
million of construction loans, and $3.1 million of loans on 
in

ome-producing properties. These figures increased to $54 million, 
$ 3 8
-7 million, and $6.3 million, respectively, for 1970, and to $90 
^ U o n , $144.6 million, and $18.1 million, respectively, for 1971. 
At 
time of the acquisition, Bank originated no 1-4 family residential 
^ t g a g e loans in areas in which offices of Advance were located; 
ij. j 
such is the case at the present time. However, Applicant then

At the time of the acquisition, no significant direct competition 
listed between Applicant and Advance in the origination of 1-4 family

In 1969, originations by Advance of loans on Income-producing

by a 1 1 mortgage companies in the United States. Advance also enjoyed

it:
 is clear that the subject acquisition did eliminate some direct 
competition between Applicant and Advance in the origination of both 
instruction loans and loans on income-producing property. The Board 
re
8ards such loss of competition as an adverse factor weighing against 
a
PProval of the application. 
Applicant's resources gave it the capability to enter

h of the local markets for 1-4 family residential mortgages served 
W Advance at the time of the acquisition..§/ However, Applicant could 
W e entered such markets either de novo or by acquisition of a firm

or by the acquisition of a smaller firm. The loss of such

A p p l i c a n t maintains that Bank and Advance serve different product

reas Bank's originations are, for the most part, conventional. We

a
8ainst approval of the application.—^ 
The 1970 Amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act direct 
the Board to consider, among possible adverse effects that could arise 
fr
°m the affiliation of a bank holding company with a nonbanking firm, 
^ e adverse effect stemming from an undue concentration of resources. 
specific adverse effect is of particular concern to the Board in the 
i n
stant application for, as noted, the acquisition combined the nation's 
t h
ird largest banking organization with the fourth largest mortgage 
C0l
*Pany i n the country. The affiliation created a financial organization 
W3
-th an immediate nationwide presence in both commercial banking and 
^ t g a g e banking. The dangers which Congress feared might arise from 
T
he Conference Report accompanying the 1970 Amendments, in discussing 
factor, states: 
"Equally important will be adverse competitive effects 
w
^ich may result from a bank holding company's acquisition of 
a going concern with which it may not presently compete. 
One 
of the asserted justifications for permitting bank holding 
companies to engage in activities that the Board has determined 
independently to be closely related to banking, is to permit 
the introduction of new innovative and competitive vigor into 
these markets which could benefit therefrom. Where a bank 
holding company enters a market through acquisition of a major 
going concern, it may not have the incentive to compete 
vigorously, thereby bringing the possible benefits into play, 
as it would immediately succeed to what it might consider its 
fair share of the market. On the other hand, where a bank 
holding company enters a new market d<e novo, or through 
acquisition of a small firm, as opposed to acquisition of a 
substantial competitor, its desire to succeed in its new 
endeavor is more likely to be competitive. This legislation 
specifically emphasizes the importance of the manner in which 
a bank holding company may enter new activities. Such con-
siderations will be particularly important in the context of 
expansion by bank holding companies into new geographic markets."

ar
* undue concentration of financial resources would appear to be 
Present 
through the combination of one of the country's largest banking 
°
r
8anizations with one of its largest mortgage bankers. 
As noted in the Conference Report accompanying the 1970 
^endments, "the dangers of undue concentration of resources include, 
are not limited to, specific competitive effects which are themselves 
L e v a n t factors under the A c t . " — ^ 
The adverse competitive effects which 
a r e
 of concern to the Board have been previously noted. 
Another 
Possible danger—though not the only one—arising from an undue concentration 
o f
 financial resources lies in the potential for abuse of the power 
tn 
S^ant credit, and thereby favor a holding company subsidiary over 
i t s
 nonbanking competitors. The record herein indicates that Applicant's 
•*-°ans to Advance increased by 1100 per cent between 1970 and 1972, 
ant
* that such loans greatly exceeded those extended to any of Advance's 
competitors during the same period. This financial support following 
subject acquisition permitted Advance, in no small part, to improve 
it<j 
Position significantly within the mortgage banking industry. 
n s
ideration of the dangers of undue concentration of resources as 
reasonably be found to arise from a consolidation of two financial 
i n s
titutions 
which, as here, have already achieved significant power 
their respective industries, requires the Board to observe the 
n
8re8sional mandate "to consider all reasonable ramifications of 
Rep. No. 91-1747, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1970).

concentration of resources in fulfilling its responsibilities 
under section 4 . " — ^ 
It is the Board's judgment, upon consideration 
o f
 the entire record, that the dangers which the Congress feared might 
a r
ise f r o m a n undue concentration of resources are present in the 
*
ns
tant application and constitute an adverse effect which weighs 
a
8ainst approval. 
Applicant has made an attempt to meet its burden of establishing 
p u
hlic benefits which outweigh the adverse effects noted above. One 
S U c
h public benefit is said to be a substantial increase in the volume 
Advance's origination of construction loans on apartment buildings 
^ 7 1 , and that such increase was made possible largely because 
"the availability of funds provided by [Applicant], primarily 
thy 
r
°ugh use of commercial paper at lower rates than Advance could have 
Stained." However, construction loans made by Bank during the same 
P e r
lod increased by an even greater margin than did those of Advance. 
Of ec
lual importance, however, is the fact that originations made by 
Ad 
Var
*ce on 1-4 family residences during this period increased by a lesser 
^fcin than did such originations for the industry as a whole. In this 
t e s
Pect, it would appear that whatever public benefits flowed from 
Ad 
V a
nce' s affiliation with Applicant were equally achievable by 
independent 
tn0rto 
u
8age bankers in the country. 
Applicant has also claimed public benefits through Applicant's 
e t l t
 authorization that permitted Advance to originate and warehouse 

_ 5014 
-10-
$ 3
° million of mortgages without investor "take-out" commitments. 
Such

 P r a c t i c e , A p p l i c a n t m a i n t a i n s , h a s a c o u n t e r - c y c l i c a l e f f e c t on the 
f l o w
 
funds into mortgage markets during tight money periods and is 
a c
cordingly socially 
beneficial. However, both affiliated and independent 
^rtgage bankers appear to warehouse an increased volume of mortgage 
during periods of tight money. Thus, the record does not permit 
atl
 inference that Applicant caused Advance to originate a greater volume 
of 
m
°rtgages during periods of tight money than it would have originated 
a s a
n independent firm. 
Applicant states that upon approval of this application 
A j 
v
ance will open new offices before the end of 1974. However, considering 
th 
e
 size and resources of Applicant, it appears that Applicant has the 
A b i l i t y to enter all such proposed new markets without acquiring 
°
ne
 of the nation's largest mortgage banking firms. In the Board's 
11, j 
Sment, such entry could be accomplished either de novo or through the 
' ^ i s i t i o n of a mortgage banking firm smaller in size than Advance. 
less anticompetitive means of entry are available and such entry 
likely to increase the vigor of competition in either a local, 
t e
Sional, or national mortgage market, the public is likely to benefit 
r e
b y . Accordingly, the Board is unable to conclude that the overall 
^
u
H i c benefits ascribed to Advance's affiliation with Applicant are 
Efficient to outweigh the substantial adverse effects of the acquisition. 

5015 
-11-
Th e Board Is cognizant of the fact that Applicant, rather than 
a^ait the eve of the statutory deadline of December 31, 1980, sought 
Prompt Board approval of its retention of Advance through submission of 
t h i s
 § 4 application. In so doing, Applicant may have denied itself 
t n e
 opportunity to present evidence relating to the public benefits 
a s
Pect of the acquisition which could only be shown through a longer 
p e r
iod of operation than Applicant afforded itself. Accordingly, the 
B
°ard
?
s issuance of an order herein denying Applicant's present appli-
C a t
ion is without prejudice to any subsequent application Applicant 
®ay 
f i l e with the Board at such time it believes more persuasive evidence 
j 
s
 available which may tend to outweigh the anticompetitive effects 
o f
 the proposal. The Board should caution Applicant, however, that 
l t s w
illingness to receive additional post-acquisition evidence does 
n
°t imply that such evidence will be "given conclusive weight or allowed 
tr» 
override all probabilities." 
(See F.T.C. v. Consolidated Foods

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR MITCHELL 
I have joined my colleagues in voting to deny First National 
C i t
y Corporation's application to retain Advance Mortgage Corporation 
be 
cause I agree that Applicant has not demonstrated public benefits 
w
hich outweigh the adverse effects associated with this acquisition. 
However, my decision is based solely upon the absence of meaning-
t . 
Public benefits to offset the loss of present and future competi-
tion associated with the acquisition. In my view, the record 
d
°
es n
°t reflect any undue concentration of resources. 
It appears that Applicant was responding to a profit opportunity 
n
 it acquired Advance in July, 1970. Such a response, of course, 
ig 
n
°t improper and, other things being equal, should not be presumed 
^0 K 
6
 Prejudicial to the public interest. However, in enacting the 
Amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act, Congress determined 
bank holding companies may engage in nonbanking activities pursuant 
* 4 ( c ) ( 8 ) only if such activities can reasonably be expected to 
Prod 
u
ce public benefits that outweigh whatever adverse effects are 
°ciated with said activities. Thus, Congress appears to have 
^
u
ired public benefits beyond those presumed to be associated with 
the n 
Pursuit of the corporate interest. Thus where adverse effects exist, 
n
Sress required something more: 
i.e., the public benefits emanating 
n e
 proposed activity must be discernible and susceptible of 
e n t
 as to their significance-

Applicant needs a stronger demonstration of lower cost, better service,

S i z a b l e would be more relevant to the issue were a differently 
cir cumstanced or smaller mortgage banking firm involved.

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
I joined the majority in voting to deny First National 
C i
ty Corporation's application to retain Advance Mortgage 
Corporation; and, in general, I concur with the Board's analysis 
with the language in its Order. In my view, however, the 
B o a
rd should not act "without prejudice to any subsequent appli-
c
ation
M
; rather the Board should deny this application unequivo-
C a l
l y and without reservation. The Board has, in effect, invited 
Applicant to reapply for retention if, and when, new evidence 
e c
ome s available which adds credence to Applicant's claim of public 
e n e
fits. Such an invitation is, in my view, inappropriate, since 
l t l
s inconsistent with the purposes of the Act and encourages 
U n c e
rtainty regarding the meaning and effect of the Board's Order. 
In denying Applicant permission to retain Advance Mortgage 
0 r
Poration, the Board determined that the possible adverse effects 
S3
°ciated with acquisition of the Nation's fourth largest mortgage 
C0tn 
Pany by its third largest banking organization were not outweighed 
P u b
l i c benefits which might reasonably be expected therefrom. The 
legal standards applicable to this determination will be the same 
n
 M e m b e r 31, 1980, the statutory deadline for retention. New data, 
e c
ting changed economic circumstances, will not alter the fact 
that th acquisition, when made, violated the standards of the Bank 
^olcH 
8 Company Act.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR SHEEHAN 
I would approve the application by First National City Corporation 
t o
 retain Advance Mortgage Corporation. I do not believe Applicant's size 
and past performance record form an adequate basis upon which the Board 
s h
ould bar its entry into nonbanking fields. This is particularly 
true where it can be shown, as here, that Applicant's operation of 
t
he acquired financial institution has permitted the latter to render 
S u
Perior service to the public. 
Applicant and Advance, combined, hold but a small percentage 
o f
 total national originations in construction loans and an equally 
S n i a
n percentage of loans on income-producing property. For example, 
i n
 1971, Advance accounted for less than 1.1 per cent of total national 
Aginations by mortgage companies of loans on income properties and 
l e s s
 than 0.3 per cent of all such originations by all mortgage lending 
institutions. Moreover, in the same year, Advance accounted for less 
than 0.5 p e r 
c e n t 
0 f total construction loan originations in the United 
ates.—

The Board correctly notes that, at the time of the acqui-
sition, Applicant and Advance did not compete in any of the same markets 
f o r
 the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Moreover, 
tll
ose markets in which Advance does compete, its largest share of 
°
ri
ginations of 1-4 family residential mortgages was but 5.2 per cent 
(Detroit, Michigan)"^ and 4.5 per cent (Indianapolis, Indiana).-^

companies. It faces an even greater number of competitors

 Detroit. Among Advance's competitors in both cities—as well as 
in 
m o s t
 other markets where Advance does business—are some of the 
a t
ion's largest mortgage bankers. Hence, it is unlikely that affiliation 
Applicant would enable Advance to dominate any relevant market; 
nc
* the record since acquisition indicates that no such dominance has 
C c
urred. Moreover, Advance's low market shares and the presence of 
Sq n, any strong competitors in each relevant market negate whatever 
f f
e c t the acquisition might have had on potential competition in any 
S u

In addition, serious questions were raised by

including leading economists, concerning the tremendous

conomic power that would be created by the concen-
tration of giant insurance companies and large banks under 
a
 single holding company umbrella. The assets of 
commercial banks and insurance companies comprise 
m
°st of the assets available for use by all the 
institutional investors in the United States. 
Insurance 
companies and banks combined control roughly 
$865 billion or 77.2 percent of the $1.1 trillion 
institutional investors in the American economy.

Commercial banks alone control $646 billion, or 
57.7 percent of this total. Various news media 
have indicated possible mergers, through the holding 
company device, of several of the largest commercial _ , 
banks and largest insurance companies in the country.— 
In my view, mortgage banking companies differ fundamentally 
from insurance companies with regard to the nature and significance 
°f their economic power. Mortgage companies, like Advance, serve 
D l e r e l
y as conduits for the dispersal of mortgage funds actually controlled 
an institutional investor for whom they service loans. 
Insurance 
C0R
ipanies, on the other hand, are—like banks—themselves significant

acc
iuiring Advance, did not significantly Increase its total financial 
Power.— Now, as before the acquisition, Advance must rely on the 
c
°nficlence of its institutional investors in order to maintain a com-
petitive posture in the various markets that it serves. Moreover,

lendable funds nor gave Applicant control of any other investor of 
s
uch funds. Congress 
did not express concern with the kind of forward 
integration reflected by the instant application. The Board, therefore, 
a t
tributes too much financial power to Advance and is, for this reason, 
a b
le to conclude that subject acquisition created an undue concentration 
o f
 resources. 
The record reflects that, since the acquisition, Advance 
u 
3 3
 reduced the cost of financing FHA multifamily construction projects 
a n d
 has also reduced the discount on its FHA 1-4 family residential 
^rtgages. 
In addition, Advance has significantly increased its total 
commitments, especially on construction loans, and has, in general, 
Piayed a more active role in the housing market since its affiliation 
v
ith A p p H c a n t . 
Such reduced costs and increased activity are possible 
be 
cause Applicant, through use of its commercial paper, has provided 
^
d v
ance with funds at rates lower than Advance could otherwise have 
°btained. Affiliation thus satisfies Advance's need for funds and 
Provides increased benefits to the public through Advance's contribution

For each of the foregoing reasons, and based upon the entire

MEMBER OF THE HOARD 
January 3, 1974 
The Honorable Jchrt G . Tower 
United States Senate 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Senator Tower: 
I am writing in response to your letter of November 5, 
1973, in which you express concern with regard to the present 
provisions for private enforcement of the Truth in Lending Act 
and other pending consumer legislation. You have offered for 
Board consideration a modification of a proposal on which this 
Board commented in its letter of July 17, 1973, to Senator 
Proxtnire, Since the Board shares many of your concerns, it 
greatly appreciates your efforts to meet the problems raised in 
that letter in the new proposal, and it has carefully considered 
your proposal. 
In addition to reflecting the Board's suggested "good 
faith" provision, now incorporated as § 206 of S. 2101 which has 
passed the Senate, this proposal would also protect a creditor 
from liability for any violation of the Act where the creditor in 
good faith has acted "in conformity with any reasonable interpreta-
tion of a significant ambiguity in, or significant conflict between, 
said rules, regulations or interpretations." 
The Board believes, as you do, that the requirements for 
compliance with Truth in Lending should be as free of ambiguities 
and conflicts as possible. Using normal intelligence and acting 
in good faith, a creditor should be reasonably assured that he will 
not be subject to frivolous and unwarranted litigation. We have 
worried for some time about some instances of abuses of civil liti-
gation. However, having carefully considered your proposal, the 
Board has reluctantly come to the conclusion that it cannot support 
your suggested modification. 
To put it briefly, the Board believes that the proposed 
language could unintentionally complicate the bringing of civil

suit to the point that it might significantly hamper the overall 
enforcement effort. There is no question that the proposal would 
help to insulate legitimate business from unwarranted litigation, 
but we are fearful that it could also inject so many issues into 
a bona fide suit--all of which would need extensive briefing and 
argument--that consumers would be discouraged from pursuing real 
grievances. Moreover, these added complications might evet\ mean 
that the only viable civil proceeding would be by class action--
-
the area of most of the present~<5Tvil litigation problems. I be-
lieve we are of one mind in assuming that although class actions 
may have their proper place, the public weal would not be well 
served by so complicating civil litigation that only actions on 
behalf of large classes of consumers would be practical. 
The Board is hopeful that its various proposals for 
amendments to the Act will provide a means of dealing with these 
civil litigation problems, and will furnish at least a partial 
answer to your concerns. As you know, the Board has suggested 
statutory amendments protecting a creditor who relies in good faith 
upon Board regulations and interpretations, although a court may 
subsequently declare them invalid. We are even more hopeful for 
benefits from our proposal for doing away with any statutory dollar 
minimum in class actions and for setting a limit on class action 
recovery. Moreover, in awarding any recovery to the class, we have 
suggested that the court be directed to consider the amount of any 
actual damages, the frequency and persistence of noncompliance, the 
number of persons adversely affected, the extent to which the 
violation was intentional and other factors. These severe limits 
on potential class action recovery, which avoid simply.matching a 
$100 statutory minimum against a large potential class, should sub-
stantially lessen the problems of abusive and frivolous lawsuits. 
Our suggestions are discussed in the Board's Annual Report on Truth 
in Lending for 1973, a copy of which is enclosed, which, incidentally, 
was considered by the Board in conjunction with your letter. 
The Board is grateful for your efforts to assist it in solv-
ing this problem. Although we do not feel we can support, your specific 
Proposal, we have welcomed the opportunity to reexamine this area. 
Our mind is not closed, but we are hopeful that the proposals we have 
made will solve the problem, and, at least for the present, we would 
Prefer to see them enacted in the form in which we have suggested them. 
! 
Sincerely yours, 
Enclosure
