Item No. 
Letter to First National City Overseas Invest- 
1 
ment Corporation, New York, New York, granting 
consent to the acquisition of 51 per cent of 
the stock of a new warehousing company to be 
formed in the Colon Free Zone, Republic of 
Panama. 
Letter to International Banking Corporation, 
2 
New York, New York, granting consent to the 
acquisition of additional shares of the stock 
of New York London Trustee Company, Limited, 
London, England. 
Letter to Lybrand, Ross Bros. & Montgomery, 
3 
Washington, D. C., requesting an audit of 
the Board's books and accounts for the year 
1968. 
With respect to Item No. 1, Governor Robertson expressed 
reservations about the proposal of the First National City group 
to go into the warehousing business. He felt that this represented 
another extension of a dangerous trend on the part of banks, through 
subsidiaries, to go into overseas activities that were not clearly 
banking or financing. He was willing to approve the request in this 
instance only because Chase Manhattan already had acquired indirect 
control of a warehouse company in Panama under an arrangement to which 
the Board had granted consent. 
In connection with Item No. 3, Governor Sherrill recalled that 
last year when the Board retained the Lybrand firm to audit its books 
there was an indictment pending against certain partners of the firm. 
While a verdict had since been rendered in the case that was then 

4003

pending, he noted that it did not affect the firm generally and that 
it would be difficult to name any leading firm of certified public 
accountants that had not been involved in some kind of litigation in 
recent years. Other Board members agreed that the circumstances 
related by Governor Sherrill were not such as to warrant discontinuing 
the arrangement with Lybrand to audit the Board's accounts. 
Reports on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Peoples' Bank, Mount Jack-
son, Virginia, with Massanutten Bank of Shenandoah Valley, National

follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of Massanutten 
Bank of Shenandoah Valley, National Association, Stras-
burg, Virginia, and Peoples' Bank, Mount Jackson, Virginia, 
both subsidiaries of First Virginia Bankshares Corporation, 
Arlington, Virginia, a registered bank holding company, 
would have no adverse competitive effects.

merger of Southern National Bank of North Carolina, Lumberton, North
