Mr. Donald F. Turner, 
Assistant Attorney General, 
Antitrust Division, 
Department of Justice, 
Washington, D. C. 20530. 
Dear Mr. Turner: 
In response to your request of January 22, 1968, booklets 
containing computer printouts of deposit data for individual banking 
offices by counties in the United States as of June 30, 1966 are 
being prepared and will be sent to your office within the next few 
days. 
The data in these booklets were collected by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation in the course of obtaining data for 
estimating its deposit insurance liability. Although surveys of this 
nature have been made at irregular intervals since 1934, it was not 
until 1966 that the Corporation endeavored to collect comprehensive 
information regarding the number of accounts and the amount of deposits 
for individual banking offices. While this information is very useful 
for an understanding of institutional structure and markets, it never-
theless has shortcomings which limit its usefulness for some types of 
comparative and analytical purposes. 
Some of the problems associated with the use of these data 
have been discussed with members of your staff. As the originator of 
the series, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is, of course, 
fully informed about the construction and limitations of the series. 
Accordingly, your staff may also wish to discuss specific detailed 
data concerning individual banks or cities with Mrs. Mary T . Mitchell 
or Mr. Theodore G. Flechsig of the FDIC before substantial reliance 
is placed upon them in any analysis. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland 
Robert C. Holland, 
Secretary.
