Minutes of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System on Tuesday, April 20, 1971. The Board met in the Board Room 
at 10:00 a.m. 
PRESENT: Mr. Burns, Chairman 
Mr. Robertson, Vice Chairman 
Mr. Daane 
Mr. Maisel 
Mr. Brimmer 
Mr. Sherrill 
Mr. Holland, Secretary 
Mr. Johnson, Director, Division of Personnel 
Administration 
The Chairman reported that the Board of Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was recommending the appointment of Mr. 
Bruce K. MacLaury, currently Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury 
for Monetary Affairs, as President of the Minneapolis Bank for the 
unexpired portion of the five-year term ending February 29, 1976, begin-
ing at an annual salary of $45,000, and with an increase to $48,000 
on January 1, 1972. The Board approved the proposed appointment of 
Mr. MacLaury, at 
the initial annual salary of $45,000, and agreed to 
consider favorably an increase in his annual salary to $48,000 at 
the beginning of 1972 if the Minneapolis directors so recommended at 
that time. It was further agreed that the contemplated deferral of 
the increase in his annual salary 
to $48,000 until the beginning of 
1972 would be so interpreted as not to disadvantage him with respect 
to the timing of any future salary adjustments. The effective date 
for Mr. MacLaury
1
s entry on duty was left subject to negotiation between 
the Minneapolis Bank and the Treasury Department.

The Board then turned to discussion of a letter dated April 8, 
1971, to Chairman Burns from Chairman Clay of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Cleveland, seeking the Board's view as to the acceptability of 
three possible additional nominees for consideration for the presidency 
of the Cleveland Bank. The Board members exchanged views on the quali-
fications of these three candidates, and suggested four additional 
persons who were regarded as qualified for the position. At the conclu-
sion of the discussion, the Board directed the Secretary to communicate 
to Chairman Clay the Board's willingness to give favorable consideration 
to any one of these seven individuals, subject to a check with three 
present and past Federal Reserve Bank Chairmen who had had personal 
e
xperience with one of the candidates. 
(Copies of Chairman Clay's 
letter of April 8, 1971, and of Mr. Holland's reply to Chairman Clay 
dated April 30, 1971, have been placed in the Secretary's confidential 
file.) 
Mr. Johnson withdrew from the meeting at this point. 
Consent calendar. Unanimous approval was given to the trans-
m
ittal to the Comptroller of the Currency of a report on the competi-
tive factors involved in the proposed merger of Washington Trust Bank, 
s
Pokane, Washington, into The National Bank of Commerce of Seattle, 
Seattle, Washington. The conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed merger of Washington 
Trust Bank, Spokane, into The National Bank of Commerce 
of Seattle would eliminate the State's eighth largest 
bank and the third largest in the Spokane market.

addition, the proposed transaction would increase the 
already high level of concentration of banking resources 
in Washington where the two largest banks, including The 
National Bank of Commerce of Seattle, hold approximately 
51 per cent of total commercial bank deposits. Overall, 
the effect of the proposal on competition would be adverse. 
A letter to The City Bank Company, Lorain, Ohio, approving a 
proposed issue of capital notes was approved unanimously. A copy is

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
BEFORE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
WASHINGTON, D. C. 
the Matter of the Application of 
FIRST AT ORLANDO CORPORATION, 
°rlando, Florida, 
approval of the acquisition of at 
ieast 80 per cent of the voting shares 
St. Johns River Bank, Jacksonville, 
p
lorida. 
ORDER APPROVING ACQUISITION OF BANK STOCK 
BY BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
There has come before the Board of Governors, pursuant to 
Action 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
l 8
^2( a)(3)), and section 222.3(a) of Federal Reserve Regulation Y 
(1 0 n 
C
FR 222.3(a)), the application of First at Orlando Corporation, 
°*lando, Florida ("Applicant"), a registered bank holding company, 
f o 
r
 the Board's prior approval of the acquisition of at least 80 per 
°
ent
 of the voting shares of St, Johns River Bank, Jacksonville, 
Pl
°rida ("Bank"). 
As required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave 
^itt 
n
 notice of receipt of the application to the Florida State 
^issioner of Banking and requested his views and recommendation. 
e
 Commissioner recommended approval of the application. 

Notice of receipt of the application was published in 
the Federal Register on March 6, 1971 (36 Federal Register 4525), 
providing 
an opportunity for interested persons to submit comments 
and views with respect to the proposal. A copy of the application 
was forwarded to the United States Department of Justice for its 
consideration* Time for filing comments and views has expired and 
a
U those received have been considered by the Board. 
The Board has considered the application in the light of 
the factors set forth in section 3(c) of the Act, including the 
effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, the financial 
ar
*d managerial resources and future prospects of the Applicant and 
tll
e banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities 
t o
 be served. Upon such consideration, the Board finds that: 
Applicant, the fifth largest banking organization in 
Florida, controls 17 banks which hold combined deposits of 
a
PProximately $493 million, representing 4.1 per cent of the 
t o t
al deposits held by Florida's commercial banks. (All banking 
d a t
a are as of June 30, 1970, adjusted to reflect holding company 
f
°rtoations and acquisitions approved by the Board through March 31, 
l 9 ?
l.) Upon acquisition of Bank (deposits $13.3 million), Applicant 
V
°
U l d
 remain the fifth largest banking organization and its control 
o f
 deposits in the State would increase slightly to 4.2 per cent. 
Bank, which operates one office in Jacksonville, is the 
l 5 t h
 largest of 29 banks and the 10th largest of 13 banking 
Sanitations in Duval County with approximately 1 per cent of 

371 
the deposits in the county. Acquisition of Bank by Applicant will 
m
ark its initial entry into the Jacksonville area, and the nearest 
subsidiary of Applicant is located approximately 70 miles southwest 
o f
 Bank. Because of the distances involved, Florida law which 
Prohibits b r a n c h b a n k i n g , and o t h e r f a c t s of r e c o r d , it a p p e a r s 
t h
at consummation of the proposal herein would not result in the 
el
imination of any significant present competition nor the fore-
cl
osure of any significant potential competition between Bank and 
Q n
y of Applicant's subsidiaries. In fact, acquisition of Bank by 
applicant may serve to enhance competition between Applicant and 
thr 
e e o t h e r 
l a r
S e holding companies which are dominant in the 
Ja
<*sonville area. 
On the record before the Board, considerations relating 
the financial condition, management, and prospects of Applicant, 
its 
Present subsidiaries and Bank are consistent with approval of 
h e
 ^Plication. Although banking needs of the Jacksonville area 
to be adequately served, consummation of the proposed acquisi-
tt0n *ould facilitate the offering of larger loans and enable Bank 
to 
c
°me an additional alternative source for services such as trust 
G
> data processing, and international banking. It is the Board's 
g m e
nt that the proposed transaction would be in the public interest 
t the application should be approved. 
It is hereby ordered. For the reasons set forth above, 
that s 
aid application be and hereby is approved, provided that 
t h e
 act* 
n
 so approved shall not be consummated (a) before the 

972

thirtieth calendar day following the date of this Order or (b) 
later than three months after the date of this Order, unless 
such time shall be extended for good cause by the Board, or by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta pursuant to delegated 
authority.

OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION BY 
MIDWEST BANCORPORATION, INC., KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, 
FOR APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION OF VOTING SHARES OF 
COMMUNITY STATE BANK, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI 
STATEMENT 
Midwest Bancorporation, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, 
("Applicant"), a registered bank holding company, has applied to the 
Board, pursuant to section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act 
1956, for prior approval of the acquisition of over 80 per cent 
the voting shares of Community State Bank, Kansas City, Missouri 
("Bank"). 
Applicant had submitted an earlier application for 
a
Pproval to acquire over 80 per cent of the voting shares of Bank 
w
hich the Board denied on November 24, 1970." 
Although the 
*
lI

was sound, the Board found that 
^PPlicant
1
s plan for financing the acquisition of Bank might 
^°Pardize the financial soundness of Applicant, its subsidiaries, 
Q n c i
 Bank, In the present proposal, Applicant has offered a new 
1116
1hod of financing the acquisition of Bank, Additionally, Appli-
a n t
 has indicated that, unlike its previous proposal, it intends 
make the same offer to majority and minority shareholders, a 
a c
tor which the Board considers to weigh in the public interest.

Views and recommendation of supervisory authority. - As 
required by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave notice of receipt 
of the application to the Commissioner of Finance of the State of 
Missouri and requested his views and recommendation. The Commissioner 
responded that he had no objection to approval of the application. 
Statutory considerations, - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
Part of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
acquisition, the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 
substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monop-
oly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, 
unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the pro-
Posed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by 
probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and 
n
eeds of the communities to be served. In each case, the Board is 
required to take into consideration the financial and managerial 
i 
resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the 
kanks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the communities 
t o
 be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - In its con-
aeration of the earlier proposal, the Board found the competitive 
c
°nsiderations to be consistent with approval of the application. 

97G 
-2-
Nothing has occurred that has altered that previous determination. 
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Statement accompanying 
the Order of November 24, 1970, relating to Applicants original 
proposal for the acquisition of Bank, the Board concludes that con-
summation of the proposed transaction would not result in a monopoly, 
nor be in furtherance of any combination, conspiracy or attempt to 
monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States, 
and would not restrain trade, substantially lessen competition, or 
tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
^he present financial condition of Applicant, its subsidiaries, and 
Bank are satisfactory; the management of each is capable; and the 
Prospects are favorable. 
In denying the earlier application, the Board found that 
the proposed method of financing the acquisition of Bank would 
adversely affect the financial condition and prospects of Applicant, 
2/ 
l t
s subsidiaries, and Bank. In its Statement 
the Board noted: 
Applicant, which was formed in October 1969, intends 
to finance the cash purchase of Bank's stock through a 
six-year l o a n , secured by the stock of its two existing 
subsidiaries and Bank. On consummation of the acquisition, 
approximately one-half of the debt would be repaid by extra-
ordinary dividends to be declared by each of the three banks. 
These dividends would reduce the capital level of two of the 
banks to approximately the minimum amount which the State 
£' Id at 949, 950. 

97G 
-2-
Comraissioner of Finance considers acceptable. The remaining 
debt - equal to 60 per cent of Applicant's net worth - would 
be repaid out of the earnings of the three banks over a 
4-6 year period,, 
The Board is of the view that the reduced capital 
position of the banks and the incurrence of a high level 
of acquisition debt by Applicant, which would hinder its 
ability to meet emergency capital needs of its subsidiary 
banks should such need arise, weigh strongly against 
approval of the application. . . 
is apparent, the previous proposal depended heavily on the use 
long-term debt in order to finance the acquisition of Bank. 
Applicant's revised plan for financing the acquisition 
Bank involves the substantial use of equity funds and relies 
less on long-term debt. The previous proposal involved no equity 
financing, an acquisition debt equal to 60 per cent of Applicant's 
n e
t worth, and a payout period of four to six years; the present 
Proposal contemplates substantial equity financing, a debt equal 
t o
 less than 25 per cent of Applicant's net worth, and a payout 
P^iod of 22 to 32 months. As in the earlier proposal, Applicant's 
r e v
ised financing plan involves the use of extraordinary dividends 
A p p l i c a n t ' s two s u b s i d i a r y b a n k s and Bank; h o w e v e r , the r e d u c e d 
C a
P i t a l l e v e l of the t h r e e b a n k s after the p a y m e n t of these d i v i d e n d s 
be at or above the level considered acceptable by the State 
^
Ol
®missioner. Furthermore, even though the present proposal still 
*
n
Vol V e s a Cq Ui sition debt, a factor which the Board has always viewed 
concern, the Board finds that in this case the Applicant appears 

5 
978 
to be financially capable of servicing the substantially reduced debt; 
and the risks, which were inherent in the previous application, have 
been significantly minimized, 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concludes that 
the present financial and managerial resources of Applicant, its 
subsidiaries, and Bank are consistent with approval, and their 
Prospects, under Applicant's revised financing plan, appear 
favorable• 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. -
The Board's previous Statement indicated that the major banking 
needs of Bank's service area appear to be adequately served by the 
listing institutions, and Applicant is proposing no new service 
that is not already being offered by other banks in the area. 
It now appears that the two nearest competitors of Bank 
have requested permission to move from the low income service area* 
Itl
 light of this, it appears that greater reliance probably will be 
Placed on Bank for meeting the banking needs of the area. There-
^°re, considerations relating to convenience and needs lend weight 
t o
 approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion., - On the basis of all relevant 
f
acts in the record, and in the light of the factors set forth in 
8e
ction 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the pro-
Posed transaction would be in the public interest and that the 
application should be approved.

APPLICATION BY 
FIRST ALABAMA BANCSHARES, INC., BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA 
TO BECOME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
STATEMENT 
First Alabama Bancshares, Inc., Birmingham, Alabama 
("Bancshares") has applied to the Board pursuant to section 3(a)(1) 
o f
 the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 for prior approval of action 
t o
 become a bank holding company through the acquisition of 80 per 
C e n t
 or more of the voting shares of The First National Bank of 
^tgomery ("Montgomery Bank"), Exchange Security Banlc, Birmingham 
('Birmingham Bank"), and The First National Bank of Huntsville 
("Huntsville Bank"), all in Alabama. 
Views and recommendations of supervisory authorities. - As 
te<
luired by section 3(b) of the Act, the Board gave written notice of 
t e c e
ipt of the application to the Comptroller of the Currency and to 
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t of Banks for the State of Alabama and requested 
views and recommendations. The Comptroller recommended approval;

Public Hearing - Notice of the receipt of the application 
was published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1970 (35 Federal 
Agister 12163) which provided an opportunity for interested persons 
to submit their comments and views with respect to the proposed trans-
ition, Thereafter, in accordance with § 3 of the Act and after the 
Superintendent's recommendation of denial, the Board published in the 
Federal Register its Order for Hearing before L. Edward Creel, its 
de
signated Hearing Examiner (35 Federal Register 14241, September 9, 1970). 
All persons desiring to give testimony or otherwise participate in the 
Public hearings held in Birmingham, Alabama, September 22-29, 1970 
W e
re permitted to do so. Five banks among the 69 that had submitted 
n v i e w s opposing the proposal requested permission to appear as 
Parties and were granted permission to do so. 
Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
ttlfl
t the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
^nopoly 
or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
Monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
p a r t
 of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 
b e
 substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly, 
w
hich in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless 
th 
e
 Board finds that the a n t i - c o m p e t i t i v e e f f e c t s of the p r o p o s e d trans-
i t i o n are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable 

985 
- 8 -
effect of the t r a n s a c t i o n in meeting the convenience and needs of the 
communities to be served. In each case, the Board is required to take 
*nto consideration the financial and managerial resources and future 
Prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, and 
tl
*e convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Additionally 
t h
e Board may not approve an application involving the formation or 
e
*pansion of a bank holding company if such action is precluded by 
S t a
t e l a w . 
Recommended decision. - On January 21, 1971, the Hearing 
Examiner filed with the Board a recommendation that the application be 
denied (the Recommended Decision is attached). The Examiner first 
c
°nsidered the contention of the protesting banks that the formation 
Of 
e
 proposed holding company would violate Alabama's banking laws, 
^ich generally limit a bank to a single office, or to branches within 
9 s
*-ngle county. The Examiner concluded that Alabama law does not in 
°f itself prohibit the establishment of multi-county bank holding 
0ni
Panies in Alabama and the Board affirms his finding and conclusion 
i n
 this regard: 
"The Board has held that a state's restrictive branch 
°ank laws did not restrict the Board's rights or responsi-
bilities in considering an application to form or to expand 
a
 bank holding company in such state (see Application of 
T e n n e s s e e Financial Corporation, 1969 Federal Reserve 
bulletin 160-161 and cases there cited; First Arkansas 
Bankstock Corporation, Federal Reserve Bulletin, October 
^
7 0
> PP. 778, 779). It is clear from this record that 
there is no statute in Alabama that prohibits the forma-
tion of a bank holding company. It is argued by the pro-
testants that it has been the policy of the state to prohibit 
a r
«y form of branch banking except that mentioned above; and 
although such generalization may be correct, we hold that 
Alabama law does not restrain the granting of this appli-
C a
tion." 
( P # 5). 

986 
- 8 -
The Examiner then considered the applicability of the 
statutory criteria set forth in § 3(c) of the Act to the proposed 
transaction. On the basis of his findings and other facts of record, 
the Board finds that: 
Montgomery Bank, located in downtown Montgomery, the county 
S G a
t of Montgomery County and the capital of Alabama, is Alabama's 
s l
*th largest banking organization,with deposits of $173 million or 
^ Per cent of the deposits in the S t a t e d It has approximately 50 per 
C G n
t of the branches and 50 per cent of the loans and deposits in 
tlle
 county. 
Birmingham Bank is located in Birmingham, the county seat 
J e f f e r s o n County a n d the f i n a n c i a l c e n t e r of the State, a p p r o x i m a t e l y 
l Q
° mile,* north of Montgomery. It is the seventh largest bank in the 
S t a
te (deposits $141 million) 
with 12 per cent of the deposits in 
the 
county. In Birmingham it competes with First National of Birmingham, 
t h e
 largest bank in the State (deposits $553 million) with 12 per cent 
f
 State deposits, and with 48 per cent of the deposits in Jefferson 
0 U n t
y ; and competes with Birmingham Trust National Bank, the second 
U t 8 e
st bank in the State (deposits $298 million) which has 26 per cent 
of t, 
n e
 deposits in the county. 
Huntsville Bank ($69 million deposits) is located 100 miles 
nottt 
B i r m i n g h a m - it is the l a r g e s t b a n k h e a d q u a r t e r e d in Madison

c w 
hanking data are as of December 31, 1969, unless stated to the

County and the tenth largest bank in the State, However the State 
National Bank of Alabama (deposits $199 million), the third largest 
bank in Alabama and the only one permitted to operate in more than one 
county, has seven branches in the county. It is estimated that, in 
terms of deposits in these branches, State National would rank second 
0 r
 third in size in the Huntsville area; however, each branch operates 
w
ith the resources of the home office, and by that criterion it is the 
la
rgest bank in the area. 
The record indicates that none of the subject banks competes 
^ith the others to any significant extent, and that the business of each 
bai
*k is primarily confined to the county or Standard Metropolitan 
Statistical Area in which it operates. The record further indicates that 
tl
*e lo largest banking organizations in the State control $1,981 million 
deposits, representing 44.8 per cent of the total deposits in the State. 
°
n
 consummation of the proposal, Applicant's three banks would control 
million in deposits, representing 8.7 per cent of Alabama deposits, 
would become the second largest banking organization in the State. 
The Hearing Examiner concluded that the consummation of the 
Pr
°Posal may substantially lessen competition in Montgomery County 
n d
 in Madison County (because the size of each of Applicant s pro-
v e d subsidiaries is such as to create a presumption, not rebutted on 
record, that the market power of each bank could not be increased 
*
l
thout adversely affecting the other banks in the market and without 

988 
- 8 -
creating the probability of a substantial lessening of competitiotl) * 
With regard to Jefferson County, the Examiner concluded that the effect 
the formation would probably not substantially lessen competition, 
because an increase in the economic power of Birmingham Bank would 
n o t
 materially change the competitive relationship between the banks 
in the county or the banking opportunities for the customers of the banks. 
Competitive considerations. - Uhile giving due consideration 
t o
 the findings, conclusions, and reasoning of the Hearing Examiner, the 
B
°ard concludes that consummation of the proposal would not substantially 
lessen competition in any relevant market. On the contrary, the Board, 
the following reasons, concludes that the proposal would enhance 
competition in several markets in Alabama: 
In Birmingham, where Birmingham Bank competes with the two 
l a r
gest banks in the State, consummation of the transaction is likely 
to make Applicant's proposed subsidiary a more effective competitor 
c 
r
 the banking business of larger customers and those customers 
n e e
di ng sophisticated services, without materially changing the 
competitive relationship vis-a-vis the smaller, primarily retail, 
a
ok s i n th e a r e a > 
F o r similar reasons, the effect of the transaction 
in 
Huntsville would likely be to increase competition between Huntsville 
and State National Bank, without significantly affecting the 
^ U e r banks in the area. Although Huntsville Bank is the largest 
l
n the county, the recommended decision does not give sufficient 
ight to the competitive capabilities of the far larger State National, 

29 
- 8 -
In Montgomery, although Montgomery Bank is the largest bank 
in its area, there is no evidence in the record that the institution 
"dominates" the market, in the sense of having the ability to establish 
the pattern of pricing and lending practices of area banks. In fact, 
the Bank's market share has diminished over the past ten years, and the 
affiliation of First Montgomery with Birmingham Bank and First Huntsville 
Bank is unlikely to have undue adverse effects on the competitive ability 
°f the smaller, retail banks in the area. 
The Board has considered a comment filed by the Department 
°f Justice, in which the Department argued that the effect of the 
transaction would be to entrench the present highly concentrated 
s t
ructure in the State and might trigger other similar combinations 
a
mong the dominant or leading banks in the State's major banking markets, 
Th 
e
 Department concluded that approval of the application "may, if 
Allowed by approvals of similar transactions combining the other 
^ a d i n g banks in Alabama, have a significantly adverse effect on 
p
°tential competition in Alabama." 
The e n t r e n c h m e n t a r g u m e n t is b a s e d on the theory that 
a
P P r o v a l of the p r e s e n t t r a n s a c t i o n w o u l d i n h i b i t e a c h b a n k from 
e
ring the market of the other de novo, or in a less anti-competitive 
^nner than through acquisition of a large competitor. However, the 
e c
ord discloses no substantial evidence that each bank could or would 
n t c r
 these markets in any other manner, 
(Applicant contends that an 
^filiation of three large banks is necessary to create competition for 

990 
- 8 -
larger banks in the State, and combinations of Applicant's proposed 
subsidiaries with de novo or smaller existing banks could not accomplish 
this purpose). Here, as was the case in the application of The First 
National Bancorporation, Inc., Denver, Colorado, to acquire shares of 
n e
 Exchange National Bank of Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado 
(April 1, 1971): "although it is nearly always possible that foreclosure 
9
 given route of expansion will encourage a resourceful organization 
t o
 seek an alternative, the Board does not in this case find the present 
c
°wpetitive circumstances to be so exigent, or possible alternatives so 
U a r l
y preferable or so likely to result, as to warrant denial of a 
Proposal which would provide immediate benefits of competition, service, 
a t > d
 economies of scale." 
With regard to the Department's concern that the Board's 
Pproval of the present application might lead to the undue concentration 
bank resources in the hands of too few banking organizations, we note 
Congress has placed with the Board the responsibility of considering 
, Public interest with regard to every formation or expansion of a 
ban>. , 
holding company. Consistent with that obligation, the Board believes 
a
Ppropriate, except in the most extreme circumstances, to relate the 
s
t$tut-
o r
y criteria to each application in the light of the competitive 
8 t
tuan 
^ l o n and other facts then existing. On that basis and after care-
lamination of the record and the recommendation of the Hearing 
m
iner, the Board concludes that consummation of the proposed transaction 
n
°t result in a monopoly, or be in furtherance of any combination, 

991 
- 9 -
conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any 
Part of the United States and would not restrain trade, substantially 
lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly in any part of the 
country. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
The record supports the findings of the Hearing Examiner that the 
hanking factors are consistent with approval of the application: 
"The financial condition of First Montgomery, First 
Huntsville and Exchange Security are satisfactory, and, 
indeed, have steadily improved over the years. There is 
no evidence that indicates that their future prospects for 
stability and growth will not continue to be excellent. 
Because of this record, it is believed that present manage-
ment and the managerial resources of the three banks are 
also excellent, and that there is no reason to believe 
this condition will not continue. It would appear that in 
the event the application [is] approved, the new corpora-
tion would likewise have . . * sound management and excellent 
financial resources." (page 8). 
Convenience and needs of the communities involved. - There 
no evidence in the record that there exist unserved banking needs 
M o n t g o m e r y , Birmingham, or Huntsville, since each market is served b y 
*
a r
ge, viable institutions capable of furnishing a relatively complete 
competitive range of services to its customers. However, the 
Affiliation would enable Applicant to more effectively marshall resources 
V i t
h i n tfie o t a t e 
t o better serve the needs of all of the component 
^ s t s involved. Additionally the pooling of resources and comple-
ments 
L a
ty skills should result in a general upgrading of services. For 
e Jtg 
m
Ple, Applicant intends to expand the trust services of the two 
!)i 
if 

- 10 -
smaller banks, utilizing the expertise of First Montgomery's large 
^ust department. While there is no clear evidence in the record 
fc
hat the existing correspondent system is inadequate, there are 
ef
ficiencies inherent in the affiliations proposed that could enable 
applicant to more effectively serve the needs of customers of each 
o f
 the banks involved. 
Factors relating to the convenience and needs of the 
immunities concerned weigh in favor of approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all the relevant 
f a c t
s contained in the record, and in the light of the factors set 
f o i r t
h i n section 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that 
the Proposed transaction would be in the public interest and that 
the 
c
 application should be approved,

CONCURRING STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR BRIMMER 
A l a b a m a has a s u b s t a n t i a l n u m b e r of b a n k s , b u t the b a n k i n g 
structure of the State is still highly concentrated. While the 
Board's approval of the application will combine under a single 
ma
nagement three strong institutions, I believe that the net 
e f
fect will be an enhancement of benefits to the public resulting 
fr 
the creation of a powerful competitor to the dominant bank in 
Alabama. Alabama is one of the least economically developed States 
j 
n
 the country. To the extent that an efficient banking system 
itself is a spur to economic development, the Board's action today 
^varices that cause. 
While the matter did not enter into my consideration of

Alabama is one of the few States that still permite-banks

 Pay checks other than at par. While two of Applicant's proposed 
^Bidiaries pay checks at par, they absorb exchange charges and 
encourage the continuation of non-par banking. The.two banks 
have 
agreed in writing to discontinue the absorption of exchange

DISSENTING STATEIiENT OF GOVERNORS ROBERTSON AND MAISEL 
We agree that Alabama law does not prohibit the formation 
of multi-bank holding companies, and that, properly controlled, 
holding company formations may contribute significantly to 
satisfaction of community needs, especially in unit banking or 
limited branching States. However, we believe that the consummation 
the t r a n s a c t i o n a p p r o v e d by the B o a r d today w i l l s u b s t a n t i a l l y 
lessen competition without offsetting public benefits. 
First, we agree i/ith the hearing examiner's conclusion 
that the Montgomery and Huntsville banks are sufficiently large 
i t l
 r e l a t i o n to their c o m p e t i t o r s that t h e i r i n c l u s i o n in a h o l d i n g 
company w i t h two o t h e r large b a n k s is likely to i n c r e a s e their 
competitive a d v a n t a g e w i t h r e s p e c t to t h e i r s m a l l e r c o m p e t i t o r s . 
c
l e a r l y , it w a s the C o n g r e s s i o n a l i n t e n t in e n a c t i n g the H o l d i n g 
Company Act to preserve the possibility that both large and small 
b
anks would compete in serving the markets in which they are located. 
Th 
n e
 theory on which the examiner recommended denial has been adopted 
i 
ky the Board and sustained by the courts in other cases (e. g., 
^lae^Corporation v. Board of Governors, 325 F 2d 960 (7th Cir., 
1963)). 
Because the examiner found that this anticompetitive 
Gf
£ect would not be outweighed by other considerations, he did not 
it necessary to consider whether consummation of the proposal 
V
°
u
ld result in adverse effects on potential competition. In our 

985 
- 2 -
judgment, these considerations argue as strongly, if not more 
strongly, for denial of the application. 
Consummation of the transaction will combine in one 
organization the sixth, seventh, and tenth largest banks in 
Alabama; it will reduce the number of potential lead banks in a 
s
tate in which there are only 8 banks with deposits over $98 million; 
l
t will remove the Huntsville bank, which, though perhaps not yet 
a
 potential lead bank, could offer competition as an independent 
W i t u t i o n or as an affiliate of a less powerful organization; 
^ will eliminate the possibility that each of the banks could 
e
^ter the market of the other through affiliation with smaller or 
nev7
ly established institutions so as to increase competition in 
e a
ch of the relatively concentrated markets. As the Board stated 
Utl
der similar circumstances in denying an application by First 
^^£g_State Corporation. Buffalo, New York (1969 Federal Reserve 
^
u
lletin 738, 740): 
"In past decisions (e. g., Reconsideration of 
plication of BT New York Corporation, 1950 Federal 
R e s e r v e Bulletin 225), the Board has indicated its 
concern with respect to proposals which would tend to 
concentrate in a single organization c o n t r o l of lead-
ing banks in several of a State's significant banking 
markets. The basis for that concern lies in the effect 
w
hich such a proposal has in foreclosing possible alter-
natives which could lead to deconcentration of those 
markets, in addition to the fact that approval of such 
P r o p o s a l s w o u l d s h o r t l y lead to domination of all of a 
State's significant banking markets by the same few bank-
i n
g organizations." 

Moreover, approval of an application involving three of 
the 10 largest banks in Alabama would appear to presage the 
further concentration of banking resources in Alabama. In the 
application of Charter New York Corporation to acquire shares of 
C e n t r a l Trust Company, Rochester, the Board concluded that the 
effect of that acquisition might be substantially to lessen com-
petition, although the banks involved did not compete significantly 
(1963 Federal Reserve Bulletin 925). The Board noted the Supreme 
c
°urt's conclusion (United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 
U.S. 321, 362 (1963)) that, because the question is whether 
a
 transaction may have the proscribed effect on competition, the 
inquiry "requires not merely an appraisal of the immediate impact 
°f the [acquisition] upon competition, but a prediction of its 
impact upon competitive conditions in the future. . . . " 
The 
Board then stated: 
"In m a k i n g t h a t p r e d i c t i o n , it is e s s e n t i a l to b e a r 
in m i n d that if a c o m p e t i t i v e s t r u c t u r e is lost t h r o u g h 
u n d u e p e r m i s s i v e n e s s , it c a n n o t r e a d i l y b e r e s t o r e d . 
W h e n a p r o p o s a l i n v o l v e s the e l i m i n a t i o n of an inde-
• ' p e n d e n t c o m p e t i t o r of the size and c o m p e t i t i v e f o r c e o f

if consistently applied, will clearly do violence to 
the letter and spirit of the legislation which it has 
the duty of impartially administering. To do other-
\fise would be to confer on a particular applicant a 
competitive advantage which similarly situated appli-
cants would be deprived in the future of the oppor-
tunity to overcome, and the unwillingness of a particu-
lar applicant to undertake less anticompetitive methods 
of expansion which are within its cspCvbility does not 
justify such a preference." 
(Id. at. 923 P) 
We believe that the policy of the law and the structure 
the relevant markets in Alabama favors the entry of large holding 
companies into those markets by means less inimical to competition 
than acquisition of substantial competitors located therein. 
It 
i s
 not helpful to note, as the majority does, that there is no 
e v
idence that Applicant would consider entering in other ways. 
T
he effect of actions such as the Board's majority adopts today 
i s
 to discourage holding companies from even considering these 
Possibilities, 
The chief justification advanced by the Board's majority 
i s
 that consummation of the proposal will create additional 
competition to the largest banks operating in Birmingham and 
Hi 
u
n t s v i H e , primarily for the business of large customers. While 
W e
 Relieve that increased competition at all levels is in the 
p u b
U c interest, we believe that this benefit to a small segment 
°
f
 the banking public does not outweigh the far more serious actual 
a t l d
 Potential disadvantages to the general public. This is espec-

In this connection we note the contention of the Applicant, 
adopted by the Board's majority, that Applicant will be better able 
to marshall resources, presumably to better serve the large business 
organizations which Applicant contends now leave Alabama, a capital 
Poor State, to obtain financing. However, several courts have 
rejected this justification where, as here, the proposal involves 
serious adverse competitive consequences. For example, the court 
n
oted in First Wisconsin Banlcshares Corporation v. Board of Governors,

. . .the customers themselves are not greatly 
disadvantaged in having to go to Milwaukee, Chicago 
or New York for larger loans; hence, the slight added 
convenience of obtaining the funds at home adds little 
weight under the fourth factor for approval of the 
application. As an added argument, Applicant suggests 
that, if more of the larger loans were made locally, 
additional deposits would remain in the community and 
would benefit local business. The point to consider, 
however, is whether these large concerns are predom-
inantly depositors or borrowers, in their banking 
relatione. If they are predominantly credit users, 
the community is better off economically if the credit 
is supplied from outside markets, because this means 
that locally generated deposit resources remain avail-
able to other local users to a greater extent than would 
be the case if the large concerns were absorbing more 
of those resources. On the other hand, if the concerns 
are primarily depositors, there are no legal restrictions 
which would limit the amount of their deposits in an 
independent bank."
