Back Bay-Orient Enterprises. There had been distributed a 
memorandum dated June 12, 1968, from the Division of Examinations 
relating to applications by United California Bank International, New 
York, New York, The Bank of New York International Corporation, New 
York, New York, and New England Merchants Bank International, Boston, 
Massachusetts, for permission to purchase shares of Back Bay-Orient 
Enterprises, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation. The recommendations 
°f the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and New York and the Division 
°f Examinations were favorable.

The discussion was in terms of the possibilities of escape 
from the guidelines of the foreign credit restraint program, reference 
being made also to the apparent non-applicability of 
the program admin-
istered by the Department of Commerce. Governor Robertson questioned 
the justification for the formation of a domestic corporation for the 
purpose of investing funds in Korea, observing that there appeared to 
be a growing tendency to create "shell" corporations which could be 
devices for circumventing the ceilings prescribed under the established 
guidelines. Governor Brimmer agreed that the situation warranted 
further study. 
It was understood that the applications would be brought back 
further consideration after staff review in the light of these 
comments. 
Report on competitive factors. There had been distributed a 
^raft of report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on the 
competitive factors involved in the proposed purchase of assets and 
assumption of deposit liabilities in The Peoples Bank, Atlanta, Georgia, 
by American Bank of Atlanta. The conclusion would state: 
Competition between American Bank of Atlanta and The 
Peoples Bank, both of Atlanta, Georgia, is rather limited 
because the two banks generally direct their efforts to 
different sectors of the deposit and loan market. How-
ever, there is potential for greater competition between 
the two banks, and the overall effect of the acquisition 
on competition would be slightly adverse. 
Members of the Board suggested that the body of the report 
needed to be amplified if the conclusion reached was to be supported.

In particular, it was felt that the banking alternatives available in 
Atlanta should be better defined. As the report was now written, 
Governors Robertson and Brimmer felt that a conclusion of "adverse" 
would be warranted. 
v. 
It was understood that the staff would rework the report in 
Jo 
the light of these comments, and that the report would then be consid-
ered by the Board again. 
The meeting then adjourned.
