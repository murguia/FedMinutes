Dear Mr. Stanton: 
This refers to your letter of June 20, 1967, 
regarding a penalty of $1,232.38 incurred by the First 
National Bank of Passaic County, Paterson, New Jersey, 
on an average daily deficiency in reserves of $535,500 
for the period ended June 7, 1967. 
It is noted that this deficiency resulted from 
the power failure in New Jersey on Monday, June 5, which 
made it impossible for the bank to process and forward 
to the Reserve Bank cash items for credit to its account. 
In the circumstances, the Board authorizes your 
Bank to waive assessment of the penalty of $1,232.38 due 
for the reserve computation period ended June 7, 1967. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman

Very truly yours,

Dear Sir: 
The contract between the Board and Brink's, 
Incorporated, for the shipment of new Federal Reserve notes 
from Washington, D. C., or other places to the Federal 
Reserve Banks, dated November 2, 1964, is being renewed by 
the Board for a term of three years ending December 31, 1970. 
There is enclosed a copy of a letter received from 
Mr. J. R. Leidgen, Vice President of Brink's, containing 
price adjustments and other changes in the contract that will 
be effective January 1, 1968. The increases in prices average 
about 4 per cent and, as will be noted from Mr. Leidgen's 
letter, are due largely to rising labor and insurance costs. 
Copies of the amended contract will be sent to you 
and to the Federal Reserve Agent when available. 
Secretary.

Dear Mr. Hall: 
In accordance with the request contained in your letter 
of June 20, 1967, the Board of Governors approves the appointment 
of Mr. Kenneth C. Robinson as Alternate Assistant Federal Reserve 
Agent at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to succeed Mr. R. H

of the Federal Reserve Agent and the need for maintenance of inde-
pendence from the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these

Please have Mr. Robinson execute the usual Oath of Office

fication of the effective date of his appointment.
