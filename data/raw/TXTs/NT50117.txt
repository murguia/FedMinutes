Posed merger of The Grove City National Bank, Grove City, Pennsylvania, 
with Northwest Pennsylvania Bank & Trust Co., Oil City, Pennsylvania.

Meetings regarding revenue bonds. Governor Robertson referred 
to the proposed meetings with commercial bank and investment banker 
representatives regarding revenue bond underwriting scheduled for 
Wednesday, July 26, and Tuesday, August 1, 1967, respectively. He 
noted that a question had been raised whether representatives of each 
group might be present during the presentation by the other group. 
Governor Robertson observed that the Board's objective was to obtain 
a s much information as possible and that it appeared to be a matter of 
judgment whether that objective would be advanced by giving each group 
V . j , , 
ari opportunity to rebut arguments of the other. 
Governor Daane expressed the view that a confrontation would 
°nly be likely to provoke debate and that it would be preferable for 
Board to meet with the two groups individually and subsequently 
exPlore in some way the arguments advanced by each group that were not 
c°vered by the other. 
u 
Governor Brimmer indicated that he shared Governor Daane's view. 
He then suggested that it might be worth while also to afford the 
"cli 
ents," that is, State and local government officials, an opportunity 
to be heard. 
w*th a 
mer 
There followed a discussion during which there was agreement 
suggestion that a transcript should be made of the meetings. 
Governor Daane expressed regret that the meeting with the com-
cial bankers was scheduled on a date when commitments in relation to 
4 I!*,-,

the negotiations on international monetary reform would require him to 
be out of the country, and he inquired whether it would be possible to 
shift that meeting to the previous day. Accordingly, the Secretary was 
requested to ascertain whether the commercial bankers would be able to 
rearrange their schedule. 
Secretary's Note: It was subsequently 
ascertained that the commercial bankers 
would find it difficult to adjust the 
meeting date. 
Further discussion of the question initially referred to by 
Governor Robertson concerning attendance at the respective meetings 
W a s deferred until Monday, July 24, when all members of the Board were 
exPected to be present, as was further discussion of the question raised 
b y Governor Brimmer concerning a meeting with State and local government 
°fficials, it being understood that in the meantime the Secretary would 
°btain information about the representative organizations to which an 
^vitation might appropriately be extended. 
The meeting then adjourned.

°f the Federal Reserve Banks,

°ear Mr. Bergin: 
With reference to the Board's letter of May 31, 1963, 
interposing no objection to incorporating into the Board Plan the 
increased retirement benefits provided by Public Law 87-793, it is 
requested that the Retirement System bill the Board for the cost 
continuing these benefits to June 30, 1968, for those annuitants 
°n the rolls as of June 30, 1967. It is understood that this cost 
w i U be approximately $27,552 for the period involved. 
It is also requested that the Retirement System continue 
to bill the Board for the individual cost of providing these supple-
mentary benefits to the survivors of eligible annuitants who die 
between July 1, 1967, and June 30, 1968. It is understood that any 
unexpended funds resulting from the death of an eligible annuitant 
efore June 30, 1968, will be credited toward next year's billing. 
The U. S. Civil Service Commission has not, as yet, 
^eceived its appropriations for the current fiscal year. However, 
9960, the Independent Offices and Housing and Urban Development 
PPropriations Act of 1968, a copy of which is enclosed, contains 
°visions to continue the supplementary retirement benefits pro-
jlded by Public Law 87-793 to Civil Service annuitants through 
Une 30, 1968. This bill has passed the House, but has not reached 
i
 e floor of the Senate. A Joint Resolution (H.J. Res. 652) was 
roduced in the House of Representatives on June 21, which would 
r°vide continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1967 through 
-gust 31. 1967, for those programs and projects of a continuing 
U r e. This would include the supplementary retirement benefits

This is in response to your request of July 6, 
'967; for an extension of time within which to consummate 
-he formation of a holding company through the acquisition 
more chan 50 per cent o.f the capital stock of The First 
National Exchange Bank of Virginia, Roanoke, Virginia, and 
Metropolitan National Bank, Richmond, Virginia, 
The Beard's Order of May 11, 1967, approving tho 
-ranaaction was contingent upon consummation of 
acqui-
sitions not later than three months after the date u£ the 
Order, You have indicated that it is improbable that the 
^opo.-jJil could be -lonsummated within that time snd have 
requested that the Order be amended to permit consummation 
a°t later than November 13, 1967. 
for 
It appears that reasonable cause has been shown 
the extension of time requested, and that such extension 
not be inconsistent with the public interest. There-
r°rei pursuant to authority delegated to it by the Board of 
governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond hereby ex-
tends the time within which the transaction may be accomplished 
Permit consummation at any time not later than November 13,
