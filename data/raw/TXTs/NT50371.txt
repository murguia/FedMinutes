Economic review. A review of the kind customarily offered in 
advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee was presented. 
The reports were based to some extent on materials that had been pre-
pared for tomorrow's meeting of the Committee, and copies of the rele-
vant documents have been placed in the Committee's files. 
The discussion that followed included a suggestion that the 
staff consider possibilities for developing more timely analyses in 
the periodic economic presentations, recognizing that the availability 
schedules of a number of the statistical series presented problems in 
that regard. 
1/ Other officers and staff of the Division also were present.

Reports on competitive factors. Upon consideration of a draft 
of report to the Comptroller of the Currency on the competitive factors 
involved in the proposed purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities 
of The Quaker City National Bank, Quaker City, Ohio, by First National 
Bank of Cambridge, Cambridge, Ohio, Board members were of the opinion 
that the competitive effect of the proposed transaction should be 
described as substantially adverse rather than adverse. There was also 
agreement that the body of the report should be revised to reflect more 
of the analysis by the Banking Markets Section. 
The report was then approved unanimously for transmittal to 
the Comptroller in a form in which the conclusion read as follows: 
Consummation of the proposed acquisition of The Quaker 
City National Bank by First National Bank of Cambridge would 
eliminate existing and potential competition, and reduce 
banking alternatives in Guernsey County from three to two. 
The overall competitive effect of the transaction would be 
substantially adverse. 
A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Southern California First National Bank, San Diego, 
California, with First National Bank of San Diego, San Diego, 
California, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller 
of the Currency. The conclusion stated that the proposed merger (which 
was merely a transaction to facilitate the acquisition of Southern 
California First National Bank by California First National Corpora-
tion, a newly-formed holding company) would have no adverse competitive 
effects.

A report on the competitive factors involved in the proposed 
merger of Alaska National Bank of Fairbanks, Fairbanks, Alaska, with 
Miners and Merchants Bank of Alaska, Nome, Alaska, was approved 
unanimously for transmittal to the Comptroller of the Currency, the 
conclusion stating that consummation of the proposed merger would have 
no adverse competitive effects. 
Hearings under Bank Holding Company Act. As noted in a 
memorand um dated December 10, 1968, from the Legal Division, The 
Citizens and Southern Holding Company, Atlanta, Georgia, had filed an 
application for a determinat ion that the insurance activities planned 
to be undertaken by proposed nonbanking subsidiaries, American Southern 
Life Insurance Company, Inc., and The Citizens and Southern Agency, Inc., 
were of the kind described in section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act so as to make inapplicable the prohibitions of section 4 of 
the Act respecting the acquisition or retention of shares in nonbanking 
companies. Since the Act requires that such determinations be made on 
the basis of the record made at a hearing, tentative arrangements had 
been made for a hearing on January 29, 1969, at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta. The Civil Service Commission had selected Leonard J. 
Ralston as hearing examiner. 
The issuance of the hearing order was authorized; a copy is 
attached as Item No. 7. James R. Smith and George Hibbert, Counsel and 
Assistant Counsel, respectively, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 
were designated as Board counsel for the proceeding.

As noted in a memorandum dated December 10, 1968, from the 
Legal Division, First Security Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah, had 
filed an application for a determination that the insurance activities 
planned to be undertaken by two nonbanking subsidiaries, either Ed D. 
Smith & Sons, Inc., and First Security Life Insurance Company of Texas 
or two corporations to be formed by the applicant, were of the kind 
described in section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as to 
make inapplicable the prohibitions of section 4 of the Act respecting 
the acquisition or retention of shares in nonbanking companies. 
Tentative arrangements had been made for a hearing on January 15, 1969, 
at the Salt Lake City Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco, and the Civil Service Commission had selected Leonard J. 
Ralston as hearing examiner. 
The issuance of the hearing order was authorized; a copy is 
attached as Item No. 8. Walter F. Scott, William L. Cooper, Louis E. 
Reilly, and William R. Bollow of the legal staff of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco were designated as Board counsel for the 
proceeding. 
Shell branches. With reference to previous Board discussions 
of pending applications by U.S. banks to establish shell branches or 
subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Governor Robertson noted that at a recent 
Congressional hearing Assistant Attorney General Vinson and another 
representative of the Department of Justice had spoken of difficulties 
posed by bank secrecy laws in the Bahamas, Switzerland, and certain 

12/16/68 
-6-
other countries in relation to the responsibilities of the Department. 
It appeared to him, therefore, that before the Board acted on the 
pending applications it might be advisable to request comments from 
Mr. Vinson regarding the implications, if any, for Department 
responsibilit les that might result from the operation of shell 
facilities in the Bahamas, and he had had a letter drafted for that 
purpose. 
No objection was indicated to the sending of such a letter, 
but there were several suggestions for changes in the draft. A letter 
in the form attached as Item No. 9 was then approved unanimously. 
The meeting recessed at this point to permit participation 
in a Board Christmas program and reconvened at 11:30 a.m. with Vice 
Chairman Robertson and Governors Mitchell, Daane, Maisel, Brimmer, and 
Sherrill present. Staff members in attendance included Messrs. Holland, 
Kenyon, Brill, Solomon, Molony, Partee, Sammons, and Bernard, and 
Mrs. Semia, all of whom had been present earlier, along with Messrs. 
Hexter, General Counsel, Norwood, Adviser, Division of International 
Finance, Hart, Assistant Director, Division of Personnel Administration, 
Morgan of the Board Members' Offices, Grimwood of the Division of 
International Finance, and Goodfellow of the Division of Supervision 
and Regulation. 
Wachovia International. Unanimous approval was given to a 
letter to Wachovia International Investment Corporation, Winston-Salem, 

4314 
12/16/68 
-7-
North Carolina, granting consent to its acquisition of convertible 
debentures of Syracuse Oils Limited, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and to 
its exercising the conversion rights contained therein. A copy is 
attached as Item No. 10. 
In taking this action the Board noted that consent to the 
proposed acquisition had been urgently requested by applicant and that 
a similar acquisition by another organization had previously been 
approved. However, Board members also noted that it was not clear 
whether the proposed acquisition was or was not incident to any 
banking relationship, and there was some disposition to feel that 
the basic policy question involved in investments by Edge corporations 
other than as an incident to the extension of credit should be explored 
and decided by the Board at a relatively early date. 
Foreign credit restraint program. With further reference 
to earlier discussions with regard to the establishment of 1969 
guidelines for the foreign credit restraint program, Governor Brimmer 
reported that at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the Balance of 
Payments last week there was considerable sentiment in favor of a 
proposal to eliminate from the guideline ceilings all export credits 
with a maturity of one year or more. He had resisted that proposal 
and had suggested, as an alternative, restoration of the so-called 
"two per cent of total assets" rule. The impasse eventually had been 
resolved following consideration of the matter in the light of a 

43 
12/16/68 
-8-
Presidential memorandum on program management during the transition to 
a new Administration, in which it was requested that program innova-
tions be held to a minimum so as not to bind the hands of the incoming 
Administration. It was judged that the course of action most 
consistent with that memorandum would be to continue the foreign credit 
restraint program guidelines essentially unchanged and such a 
recommendation to the President was agreed upon, although with an 
expectation that the Federal Reserve would review the program early in 
1969 to determine whether additional flexibility for financing U.S. 
exports might be provided in the guidelines. 
Accordingly, Governor Brimmer recommended that the Board 
approve a continuation of the existing guidelines with only minor 
changes, contingent upon acceptance by the President of a recommenda-
tion from the Cabinet Committee regarding the over-all balance of 
payments program. 
Governor Brimmer then explained the nature of the few 
changes in the guidelines that were contemplated. First, since the 
Export-Import Bank was now prohibited by statute from participating in 
the financing of defense exports, the Department of Defense had 
requested that the financing of such exports through other arrangements 
be exempted from the purview of the program, and this appeared to be 
in the national interest. Also, whereas under the existing guidelines 
banks were requested to reduce the amount of their short-term credit 

4316 
12/16/68 
-9-
outstanding to residents of developed countries of continental Western 
Europe to 60 per cent of the amount of such credit outstanding on 
December 31, 1967, no further reduction would be requested under the 
proposed guidelines for 1969. Banks' ceilings would continue to be 
reduced by the amount of repayments of term loans to residents of 
developed countries of continental Western Europe, and banks would be 
requested to continue to make no further term loans to residents of 
such countries except to finance exports of U.S. goods and services. 
There followed a discussion of accomplishments under the 
1968 guidelines, the effects of the proposed changes, and the general 
outlook for the U.S. balance of payments. 
The Board then approved the proposed guidelines for 1969 by 
unanimous vote, contingent upon the taking of the necessary action by 
the President, and authorized their issuance, along with a suitable 
press release, at the appropriate time. (Note: A press statement on 
the guidelines was issued under date of December 20, 1968, for release 
in morning papers of December 23, 1968. Copies of the press statement 
and the guidelines are attached under Item No. 11.) 
Several members of the staff withdrew at this point. 
Director appointment. It was agreed to ascertain through 
the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City whether 
Robert W. Wagstaff, President, Kansas City Coca-Cola Bottling Company, 
Kansas City, Missouri, would accept appointment if tendered as a 
Class C director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for the 

... -i- s 
12/16/68 
-10-
three-year term beginning January 1, 1969, with the understanding 
that if it were found that he would accept, the appointment would be 
made. 
Secretary's Note: It having been ascertained 
that his acceptance would be forthcoming, an 
appointment telegram was sent to Mr. Wagstaff 
on December 18, 1968. 
Salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presidents. Unanimous 
approval was given to the payment of salaries to the Presidents and 
First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco for the year beginning 
January 1, 1969, at the annual rates fixed by the directors of the 
respective Banks as reported in a memorandum from the Committee on 
Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans dated December 11, 1968. 
Copies of the letters sent to the Chairmen of the St. Louis, 
Dallas, and San Francisco Banks are attached as Items 12-14. (Note: 
The salary rate fixed for the First Vice President of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was inadvertently reported as $37,500, 
rather than $35,000, in the December 11 memorandum. Corrective action 
was taken by the Board on December 19, 1968. The annual rate approved 
for the President of the Bank was $50,000.) 
Salaries of Reserve Bank officers. Memoranda dated 
December 12 and 13, 1968, from the Committee on Organization, 
Compensation, and Building Plans stated that the Committee had 
reviewed officer salary proposals for 1969 for all of the Federal 

4313 
12/16/68 
-11-
Reserve Banks except Kansas City and recommended that the Board approve 
those salaries effective January 1, 1969. 
After discussion, unanimous approval was given to letters to 
the eleven Federal Reserve Banks approving the salaries proposed for 
their officers. Copies are attached as Items 15-25, inclusive. 
Salary structure at Philadelphia. Unanimous approval was 
given to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia approving 
a revision of the salary structure applicable to employees of that 
Bank. A copy is attached as Item No. 26. 
Consultant fees. Governor Sherrill advised the Board of his 
intention to approve an increase from $95 to $100 in the maximum daily 
fee payable to Board consultants. 
The increase was noted without objection. 
Officers and appropriate staff members of the Division of 
Research and Statistics and the Division of International Finance 
entered the room at this point, along with Messrs. Broida, Molony, 
Cardon, Coyne, and Bernard. 
Money market review. The usual weekly review was presented; 
copies of the statistical materials prepared in connection therewith 
have been placed in the Board's files. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 

4319 
12/16/68 
-12-
Discount rate. There was a further discussion of what action 
the Board might take with respect to the discount rate in light of the 
Reserve Bank proposals that were before it, such proposals calling for 
either a 1/4 percentage point or a 1/2 point increase. A related 
question was whether the Board should also announce an increase in 
member bank reserve requirements, effective in the latter part of 
January. 
At the beginning of the discussion Mr. Solomon summarized, 
at the request of the Vice Chairman, a communication received by the 
Treasury late last week from a senior official of the Department who 
was in London. As Mr. Solomon appraised the report, it suggested that 
not much more in the way of pressure on sterling or loss of reserves 
would be required to cause the British to let the pound sterling rate 
float. 
Governor Daane then reported having received through 
President Hayes of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York the judgment 
of Mr. Coombs, Special Manager of the System Open Market Account, who 
was also in London. Mr. Coombs' observations were substantially 
similar to those of the Treasury official, although apparently a bit 
more optimistic. In Mr. Coombs1 opinion the British could live with a 
1/4 point increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate at this 
juncture, despite their precarious reserve position, but the announce-
ment of stronger Federal Reserve monetary measures might lead to a 
British decision to let the pound float. 

4320 
12/16/68 
-13-
Governor Daane had the impression that President Hayes also 
had talked with an official of the Bank of England and had received 
much the same impression as from Mr. Coombs. 
In the discussion that ensued it was generally agreed that 
no action should be taken by the Board today and that instead it 
would be desirable to await the exchange of views and information at 
tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. In addition, 
the Vice Chairman felt that it might be possible to obtain further 
information or opinions on the international situation that would be 
helpful. 
As to positions at the moment, three members of the Board 
(Governors Daane, Maisel, and Sherrill) were inclined to believe that 
a 1/4 point increase in the discount rate, coupled with a tightened 
open market policy and the constraint imposed by a continuation of 
the current interest rate ceilings, would constitute a sufficient 
wove at this time, leaving the question of action on reserve require-
ments for consideration after the turn of the year in the light of 
conditions as they then existed. Governor Daane's reasoning appeared 
to reflect more than that of his colleagues the constraint that he felt 
was imposed by the international situation; he indicated that otherwise 
he might prefer a 1/2 point increase in the discount rate. Governors 
Maisel and Sherrill felt that, regardless of whatever consideration was 
given to the international factor, monetary policy moves at this time 

4321 
12/16/68 
-14-
beyond those that they outlined might run the risk of overreaction and 
create more restraint than would be advisable, so they preferred to 
reserve judgment on the reserve requirement question. 
The other members of the Board (Governors Robertson, 
Mitchell, and Brimmer) were of the opinion that an announcement 
limited to a 1/4 point increase in the discount rate would be insuffi-
cient to convey to the public what they believed was needed at this 
juncture, namely, a signal of a change in the stance of Federal Reserve 
policy. For that reason, they favored an overt move to the more 
subtle strategy involved in open market operations; they suggested 
that if the degree of restraint proved to be too severe, it could be 
offset to some extent through open market operations. Governors 
Mitchell and Brimmer were inclined to feel that a decision should be 
reached primarily on the basis of what was judged to be required in 
terms of the domestic situation; if the British situation was in fact 
as precarious as some seemed to believe, they concluded that the status 
quo probably could not be preserved, at least for any length of time, 
by 
refraining from the adoption of policy measures that the Federal 
Reserve might otherwise deem appropriate. Governor Robertson was 
Inclined to give somewhat more weight in his reasoning to the inter-
national factor, which he felt should at least be considered carefully 
in the light of the best information available with a view to 
assessing the degree of risk that would appear to be involved in 
alternative Federal Reserve policy actions. 

< 1322 
12/16/68 
-15-
When it came to the form of a reserve requirement move, 
Governor Mitchell continued to prefer an increase in the requirements 
applicable to demand deposits while Governor Brimmer continued to 
favor applying the increase to time deposits. Governor Robertson 
indicated that his position was flexible, and he asked that the staff 
provide additional information to the Board members on alternative 
models. 
It was understood that the staff also would make available 
to the Board members tentative drafts of a press release that might be 
issued depending on the policy decision finally reached by the Board. 
As to what should be said at tomorrow's Open Market Committee 
meeting, it was concluded that the Presidents should be informed that 
the Board expected to reach a decision on the discount rate tomorrow 
afternoon, with more members presently inclined to favor a 1/4 point 
increase than a 1/2 point increase, and that consideration also was 
being given to the possibility of a further policy move in the form of 
a change in reserve requirements. It was noted that an effort should be 
made to construct the Committee's current economic policy directive in 
such a manner that the directive would be consistent with whatever 
Policy action or actions should later be decided upon by the Board. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Mr. Walter J. Heddesheimer, Secretary, 
Central National Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 44115 
Dear Mr. Heddesheimer:

of Central Cleveland International Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, 
and there is enclosed a Preliminary Permit authorizing that Corpo-
ration to exercise such of the powers conferred by Section 25(a)

Except as provided in Section 211.3(a) of Regulation K, 
the Corporation may not exercise any of the other powers conferred 
by Section 25(a) until it has received a final permit from the 
Board authorizing it generally to commence business. Before the 
Board will issue its final permit to commence business, the 
President, Treasurer, or Secretary, together with at least three 
of the directors, must certify (1) that each director is a citizen 
of the United States; (2) that a majority of the shares of capital 
stock is held and owned by citizens of the United States, by corpo-
rations the controlling interest in which is owned by citizens of 
the United States, chartered under the laws of the United States 
or of a State of the United States, or by firms or companies the 
controlling interest in which is owned by citizens of the United 
States; and (3) that of the authorized capital stock specified in 
the Articles of Association at least 25 per cent has been paid in 
in cash and that each shareholder has individually paid in in cash 

4326 
Mr. Walter J. Heddesheimer

at least 25 per cent of his stock subscription, and must forward a 
certified copy of an amendment to ARTICLE ELEVENTH of the Articles 
of Association so it reads, "This corporation shall have succession 
for a period of twenty years from the date of issuance of its pre-
liminary permit to begin business. . .." Thereafter the Treasurer 
or Secretary shall certify to the payment of the remaining instal-
ments as and when each is paid in, in accordance with law. 
Your attention is called to the fact that Central Cleveland 
International Corporation will have no separate base under the foreign

need to be made under the ceiling of Central National Bank of Cleveland. 
Accordingly, the foregoing approval is given with the understanding 
that any foreign loans and investments of the Corporation will be 
made within the guidelines established under the foreign credit 
restraint effort now in effect as they apply to the foreign lending 
and investment activities of Central National Bank of Cleveland and

The Board's consent to the acquisition and holding of shares of 
FNCB Switzerland by FNCB is granted subject to the applicable provisions of 
Section 25 and Regulation M and to the following conditions: 
(1) That such shares shall be disposed of as promptly as practicable 
if FNCB Switzerland shall in any manner engage in any activity 
or take any action whatsoever that would not be permissible 
if FNCB Switzerland were a corporation organized under Section 
25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act not "engaged in banking"; 
(2) That, when required by the Board of Governors, FNCB will fur-
nish' the Board with such reports regarding the activities of 
FNCB Switzerland as it may require from time to time; 
(3) That any share acquisitions or dispositions by FNCB Switzerland 
be reported under Section 211.8(c) of Regulation K in the 
same manner as if FNCB Switzerland were a corporation organized 
under Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act; and 
(4) That FNCB shall not carry on its books the shares of FNCB 
Switzerland at a net amount in excess of its proportionate 
share of the book capital accounts of FNCB Switzerland, after 
giving effect to the elimination of all known losses.

1/ 
Eighteen domestic banks 
have applied for Board permission 
to establish branches or wholly-owned subsidiaries which would conduct 
certain limited banking operations in the Bahamas under non-resident 
licenses issued by Bahamian authorities. Most of these facilities 
Would consist, at least initially, of merely an address and a bookkeep-
ing operation under a part-time "manager" supplied in most cases by some 
institution currently operating in the area. All deposit and loan 
ransactions would be negotiated, and all policy decisions made, by the 
Parent bank in the United States. No contact with the public or local 
usiness in the Bahamas is contemplated. Basically, these facilities 
would operate as adjuncts of their parent banks in attracting foreign 
ePosit funds for lending to the parent's foreign customers. Six 
member banks of the Federal Reserve System^/ and one nonmemberl/ already 
operate similar facilities in Nassau, and two other member banks-' con-

Item No. H 
12/16/68 
For release in morning papers, 
Monday, December 23, 1968. 
December 20, 19o8, 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System today 
issued revised guidelines, effective immediately, for restraint of 
foreign credits by banks and other financial institutions. 
The revised guidelines continue the President's program, 
announced on January 1, 1968, to strengthen the U.S. balance of pay-
ments. In general, the program for 1969 for financial institutions 
l s the same as that for 1968. 
The ceiling on foreign credit extensions by banks remains 
at the level specified in the January 1, 1968, guidelines, as adjusted. 
For about one-half of the reporting banks, accounting for more than 90 
Per cent of the aggregate ceiling, this is essentially 103 per cent of 
the 1964 base. For the remainder of the reporting banks the ceiling 
*iU continue to be the 1967 ceiling plus one-third of the difference 
hetveen that amount and 2 per cent of total assets as of December 31, 196o, 
Banks are requested to continue to refrain from making new 
term loans, except to finance U.S. exports, to residents of developed 
countries of continental Western Europe, and to continue to reduce 
their ceiling each month by the amount of repayment of such loans out-
standing on December 31, 1967. However, under the revised guidelines 
banks would not be precluded from making equity investments in those 
countries, subject to their ceilings and to Board requirements. 

-2-
Banks also are asked to hold short-term credits to resi-
dents of developed countries of continental Western Europe to the 
level requested in the January 1, 1968, guidelines, that is, 60 
per cent of the amount of such credits outstanding on December 31, 
1967. 
The definition of covered assets for nonbank financial 
institutions is unchanged, and the ceiling remains at 95 per cent 
of the adjusted end-of-1967 base. Institutions that have not 
succeeded in reducing their holdings of covered assets by at least 
5 per cent during 1968 are asked to accomplish this reduction during 
1969. 
Governor Andrew F. Brimmer, the Board member charged with 
the responsibility for the administration of the program, pointed 
out that as of October 31, 1968, the banks had reduced their holdings 
of covered foreign assets by $633 million since December 31, 1967, 
a s compared with a suggested reduction for the entire year of $400 
Million. As a result of this reduction, the banks on October 31 
were more than $500 million below the ceiling effective on that date. 
Governor Brimmer said that the ceiling would be reduced by approxi-
mately $100 million during the last two months of the year by 
deductions related to repayments of credits to developed countries 
continental Western Europe. There is usually a seasonal outflow 
Â°f bank credit during the fourth quarter, but Governor Brimmer said 
is confident that the banks will exceed the objective requested in 
the guidelines for January 1, 1968. 

In considering the foreign credit restraint program, the 
Board concluded that the balance of payments prospects for 1969 
do not permit any basic change in the program for restraint on 
foreign lending by U. S. financial institutions. However, in view 
of the importance of increasing receipts on current account, the 
Board indicated its intention to review the program early in 1969 
to determine whether additional flexibility for financing U. S. 
exports might be provided in the guidelines. 
Nonbank financial institutions reporting under the program 
reduced their holdings of foreign assets subject to the target ceiling 
by $192 million during the first nine months of the year, but $73 
million of this amount represented sales of covered equities to 
other American investors. Nevertheless, covered assets held by these 
institutions as a group on September 30, 1968, were only 92 per cent 
their adjusted base-date holdings, or less than the 95 per cent 
ratio targeted for year-end. 
Copies of the revised guidelines are attached. They are 
being made available to financial institutions through the Federal 
Reserve Banks. Banks and other financial institutions having 
questions concerning the application of the revised guidelines are 
urged to consult with the Federal Reserve Bank of their district. 

4344 
REVISED GUIDELINES 
FOR BANK AND NONBANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
On January 1, 1968, a new program to reduce the deficit in the 
nation's balance of payments was announced by the President of the United 
States. An integral part of that program was the reduction during 1968 
by at least $500 million of foreign claims held by financial institutions. 
It appears at this time that this objective will be met. It has 
been determined, however, that restraint of capital outflow, both public 
and private, will continue to be required in 1969. Accordingly, the Board 
of Governors has revised the guidelines for banks and other financial 
Institutions as follows: 
The Revised 1969 Program for Commercial Banks 
The basic 1969 ceiling for each bank reporting on December 31, 
1968, will be the bank's ceiling as of that date calculated in accordance 
with the guidelines issued on January 1, 1968. 
All banks are requested to continue to make no new term loans 
(loans with original maturities of more than one year) to residents of 
developed countries of continental Western Europe except to finance 
exports of U.S. goods and services. However, this provision does not 
aPply to equity investments in those countries. Each bank will 
cÂ°ntinue to reduce its ceiling on each reporting date by the amount 
repayments during the preceding month of term loans to Western 
Europe outstanding on December 31, 1967. 

4315 
-2-
All banks also are asked to hold the amount of short-term credit 
outstanding (loans with maturities of 1 year or less) to residents of 
developed countries of continental Western Europe to an amount not more 
than the limit that the banks were requested to observe under the 1968 
Program; that is, 60 per cent of the amount of such credits outstanding 
on December 31, 1967. 
These revisions in the guidelines are intended to forestall any 
large outflow of bank capital during 1969 by maintaining banks' foreign 
assets at about the level planned for 1968. 
The Revised 1969 Program for Nonbank Financial Institutions 
The 1969 program for nonbank financial institutions is identical 
in all substantive respects with the program in effect during 1968. The 
definition of covered assets is unchanged, but the treatment of leased 
Property is clarified. The target ceiling remains at 95 per cent of the 
adjusted end-of-1967 base. Institutions that did not reduce their holdings 
Â°f covered assets by at least 5 per cent during 1968 will be expected to 
increase their efforts to accomplish such a reduction during 1969.

(5) A bank that had no ceiling in 1968, or that had foreign assets 
$500,000 or less on October 31, 1967, may discuss with the Federal Reserve 
^ank of the Federal Reserve district in which it is located the possibility 
Of rl 
adopting a special ceiling adequate to permit the bank to meet reasonable 
Priority credit demands of existing customers or originating in its normal 
tra<*e area. 

4349 
-6-
In discussing the ceiling of such a bank, the Federal Reserve Bank 
will ascertain the bank's previous history in foreign transactions, including 
acceptance of foreign deposits or handling foreign collections, and the 
reasons why the bank considers that it should engage in foreign transactions. 
D. 
Reporting 
(1) Banks that report on Treasury Foreign Exchange Forms B-2 or B-3, 
that have been granted special ceilings under provisions of these guide-
lines, should file a Monthly Report on Foreign Claims (Form F.R. 391/69) 
wi-th the Federal Reserve Bank of the Federal Reserve district in which the 
bank is located. 
(2) Copies of Form F.R. 391/69 are available at the Federal 
Reserve Banks. 
Exclusions from the ceilings 
Loans to finance U.S. exports guaranteed or participated in by 
the Export-Import Bank or the Department of Defense, or insured by the Foreign 
Credit Insurance Association, are excluded from the ceiling. The role of 
Government lending abroad within the framework of the President's program 
is coordinated by the National Advisory Council for International Monetary 
and Financial Policies. 
Also excluded are claims on Canadian residents. 
Credits in excess of ceiling 
A bank would not be considered as acting in a manner inconsistent 
with the program if it temporarily exceeded its ceiling as a result of the 
extension of bona fide export credits. 

4350 
-7-
The bank should, however, refrain from making new extensions of 
nonpriority credits so as to reduce its claims on foreigners to an amount 
within the ceiling as quickly as possible. It should also take every oppor-
tunity to withdraw or reduce commitments, including credit lines, that are 
not of a firm nature and to assure that drawings under credit lines are 
kept to normal levels and usage. At time of renewal, each credit line should 
be reviewed for consistency with the program. 
A bank whose foreign credits are in excess of the ceiling will be 
invited periodically to discuss with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank 
the steps it has taken and proposes to take to reduce its credits to a 
level within the ceiling. 
Loan priorities 
Within the ceiling, absolute priority should be given to bona fide 
export credits. Credits that substitute for cash sales or for sales 
customarily financed out of nonbank or foreign funds are not entitled to 
Priority. 
With respect to nonexport credits, banks should give the highest 
Priority to loans to developing countries and should avoid restrictive poli-
cies that would place an undue burden on Japan or the United Kingdom. 
A bank whose 1969 ceiling is larger than its ceiling for 1967 
will be expected to restrict the use of any excess over its 1967 ceiling 
t o priority credits (that is, export credits and credits to developing 
countries) originating among the bank's regular customers or residents 
o f its trade territory. That is, subject to the limitations set forth 
ln Guideline 1C(1), holdings of foreign credits on any reporting date 

4351 
-8-
should not exceed the 1967 ceiling by more than the increase in holdings 
Â°f priority credits between December 31, 1967, and the reporting date. 
Trust departments 
Trust departments of commercial banks should follow the guidelines 
with respect to nonbank financial institutions. 
Transactions for the account of customers 
A bank should bear in mind the President's balance of payments 
Program when acting for the account of a customer. Although the bank is 
obliged to follow a customer's instructions, it should to the extent 
possible discourage customers from placing liquid funds outside the United 
States, except in Canada. A bank should not place with a customer foreign 
obligations that, in the absence of the voluntary credit restraint program, 
it would have acquired or held for its own account. 
^' 
Foreign branches 
The voluntary credit restraint program is not designed to restrict 
the extension of foreign credits by foreign branches if the funds utilized 
are derived from foreign sources and do not add to the outflow of capital 
from the United States. 
Total claims of a bank's domestic offices on its foreign branches 
(including permanent capital invested in, as well as balances due from, 
S u ch branches) represent bank credit to nonresidents for the purposes of 
the program. 
3 
|| 
* â€”Edge Act" corporations 
"Edge Act" and "Agreement" corporations are included in the foreign 
credit restraint program. Corporations that chose to adopt a separate 

4352 
-9-
ceiling und er the provisions of Guideline No. 11 issued in February 1965 
Â®ay continue to report separately from their parent banks or may combine 
foreign loans and investments with those of their parent banks for purposes 
of the program. No special ceilings are provided for Edge Act or Agreement 
corporations formed since February 1965. 
Edge Act or Agreement corporations owned by a bank holding company 
may combine foreign loans and investments with any one or all of the banks 
in the holding company group for purposes of the program. 
Bank holding companies 
Registered bank holding companies will be treated as banks for the 
Purposes of these guidelines. Banks in which controlling interest is held 
by a corporation other than a registered bank holding company will continue 
to be treated as banks for these purposes. 
Registered bank holding companies may combine the ceilings and 
foreign loans and investments outstanding of one or more of the banks in 
the holding company group. 
Any company formed after December 23, 1968, for the purpose of ac-
quiring controlling interest in a commercial bank will be treated as a bank 
fÂ°r the purpose of this program, and foreign assets acquired by the company 
Â°r any of its subsidiaries, including the bank, will be counted against the 
existing ceiling of the acquired bank. 
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
Branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States 
are requested to act in accordance with the spirit of the domestic commer-
cial bank voluntary credit restraint program. 

lo-
ll. Loans to U.S. residents and substitution of domestic credit for credit 
from foreign sources 
There are a number of situations in which loans to domestic cus-
tomers, individual as well as corporate, may be detrimental to the President's 
balance of payments program and hence should be avoided. Examples are: 
(A) Loans to U.S. residents -- individuals as well as corporations --
that will aid the borrower in making new foreign loans or investments in-
consistent with the President's program. Banks should avoid making new loans 
that would directly or indirectly enable borrowers to use funds abroad in 
a manner inconsistent with the Department of Commerce program or with the 
guidelines for nonbank financial institutions. 
(B) Loans to U.S. subsidiaries and branches of foreign companies that 
Â°therwise might have been made by the bank to the foreign parent or other 
foreign affiliate of the company or that normally would have been obtained 
abroad. 
Management of a bank's liquid funds 
A bank should not place its own funds abroad for short-term 
investment purposes, whether such investments are payable in foreign 
currencies or in U.S. dollars. This does not, however, apply to invest-
ments in Canada, nor does it call for a reduction in necessary working 
balances held with foreign correspondents. 

4354 
-n-
Guidelines for Nonbank Financial Institutions 
Nonbank financial institutions 
The group of institutions covered by the nonbank guidelines 
includes: trust companies; trust departments of commercial banks; 
mutual savings banks; insurance companies; investment companies; finance 
companies; employee retirement and pension funds; college endowment 
funds; charitable foundations; and the U. S. branches of foreign 
insurance companies and of other foreign nonbank financial corporations. 
Investment underwriting firms, securities brokers and dealers, and 
investment counseling firms also are covered with respect to foreign 
financial assets held for their own account and are requested to inform 
their customers of the program in those cases where it appears applicable. 
Businesses whose principal activity is the leasing of property and equip-
ment, and which are not owned or controlled by a financial institution, 
are not defined as financial institutions. 
Sgilinp, a na priorities 
Through the end of calendar 1969, each institution is requested 
to limit its aggregate holdings of foreign assets covered by the program 
tÂ° no more than 95 per cent of the adjusted amount of such assets held 
December 31, 1967. 
Institutions generally are expected to hold no foreign deposits 
Â°r money market instruments (other than Canadian). However, an institu-
tion may maintain such minimum working balances abroad as are needed for 
the efficient conduct of its foreign business activities. 

4355 
-12-
In addition, institutions are expected to refrain from making 
any new investments, in either debt or equity form, in the developed 
countries of continental Western Europe, except for new credits that are 
essential to the financing of U. S. exports. This means that reductions 
through amortizations, maturities or sales are not to be offset by new 
acquisitions in these countries. 
Among other foreign assets that are subject to the guideline 
ceiling, institutions are asked to give absolute priority to credits 
that represent the bona fide financing of U. S. exports. 
Institutions may invest in noncovered foreign assets generally 
a s desired. However, they are requested to refrain from making any loans 
and investments, noncbvered as well as covered," which appear to be 
inconsistent with other aspects of the President's balance of payments 
Program. Among these are the following: 
(1) noncovered credits under this program that substitute 
directly for loans that commercial banks would have 
made in the absence of that part of the program applicable 
to them; 
(2) noncovered credits to developing-country subsidiaries of 
U. S. corporations that would not have been permitted 
under the Department of Commerce program if made by the 
U. S. parent directly. 
(3) credits to U. S. corporate borrowers that would enable 
them to make new foreign loans and investments inconsistent 
with the Department of Commerce program. 
(A) credits to U. S. subsidiaries and branches of foreign com-
panies that otherwise would have been made to the foreign 
parent, or that would substitute for funds normally obtained 
from foreign sources. 

! V' 
-13-
Covered assets 
Covered foreign financial assets, subject to the guideline 
ceiling, include the following types of investments, except for "free 
delivery" items received after December 31, 1967: 
1. Liquid funds in all foreign countries other than Canada. 
This category comprises foreign bank deposits, including 
deposits in foreign branches of U. S. banks, and liquid 
money market claims on foreign obligors, generally defined 
to include marketable negotiable instruments maturing in 
1 year or less. 
2. All other claims on non-Canadian foreign obligors written, 
at date of acquisition, to mature in 10 years or less. 
This category includes bonds, notes, mortgages, loans, 
and other, credits. Excluded are bonds and notes of 
international institutions of which the United States is 
a member, and loans guaranteed or participated in by the 
Export-Import Bank or the Department of Defense or insured 
by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association, regardless 
of maturity. 
3. Net financial investment in foreign branches, subsidiaries 
and affiliates, located in developed countries other than 
Canada and Japan.!/ Such financial investment includes 
payments into equity and other capital accounts of, and 
net loans and advances to, any foreign businesses, in 
which the U. S. institution has an ownership interest of 
10 per cent or more. Excluded are earnings of a foreign 
affiliate if they are directly retained in the capital 
accounts of the foreign business. 
4. Long-term credits of foreign obligors domiciled in 
developed countries other than Canada and Japan.i/ 
Included in this category are bonds, notes, mortgages, 
loans, and other credits maturing more than 10 years after 
date of acquisition. Excluded are bonds of international 
institutions of which the United States is a member. 
1/ See "Note" on p, 19. 

B 
4357 
-14-
5. Equity securities of foreign corporations domiciled in 
developed countries other than Canada and Japan, except 
those acquired after September 30, 1965, in U. S. markets 
from American investors.!./ The test of whether an equity 
security is covered will depend on the institution's 
obligation to pay the Interest Equalization Tax on 
acquisition. Exclusion from covered assets under this 
program normally will be indicated when, in acquiring 
an equity security that otherwise would be covered, the 
purchasing institution receives a certificate of prior 
American ownership, or brokerage confirmation thereof. 
Base-date holdings 
Base-date holdings for any reporting date in 1969 are defined 
as: (1) total holdings of covered foreign assets as of December 31, 1967; 
(2) minus, equity securities of companies domiciled in developed countries 
(except Canada and Japan), that are included in (1) but had been sold to 
American investors prior to the current quarter; (3) plus, or minus, 
the difference between sales proceeds and "carrying" value of covered 
equitie s sold prior to the current quarter to other than American investors 
in other than U. S. markets. On each reporting date in 1969, "carrying" 
value should be the value reflected in the institution's report (on 
Form FR 392R-68) for December 31, 1967, in the case of equities held on 
that date, and it should be cost in the case of equities purchased after 
that date. 
"Adjusted" base-date holdings, to which the 95 per cent ceiling 
applies, are equal to "base-date" holdings as defined above adjusted for 
Sales during the current quarter of included covered equities in accordance 
X9ith the procedures specified in points (2) and (3) of the preceeding 
Paragraph. 
U 
See "Note" on p. 19. 

-15-
Noncovered assets 
Foreign financial assets not covered by the guideline are 
still reportable on the quarterly statistical reports to the Federal 
Reserve Banks. Such noncovered foreign investments include the following: 
1. All financial assets in, or claims or residents of, the 
Dominion of Canada. 
2. Bonds and notes of international institutions of which 
the United States is a member, regardless of maturity. 
3. Long-term investments in all developing countries and in 
Japan, including credit instruments with final maturities 
of more than 10 years at date of acquisition, direct 
investment in subsidiaries and affiliates, and all equity 
securities issued by firms domiciled in these countries. 
4. Equity securities of firms in developed countries other 
than Canada and Japan that have been acquired in U. S. 
markets from American investors (see Point 5 above). 
Foreign assets of types covered by the program and acquired as 
"free delivery" items--that is, as new gifts or, in the case of trust 
companies or trust departments of commercial banks, in new accounts 
deposited with the institution--are not defined as covered assets, if 
they are acquired after December 31, 1967. Such assets should be reported 
as a memorandum item, as should all loans held that are guaranteed or 
participated in by the Export-Import Bank or the Department of Defense, 
insured by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association. 
Credits to certain U. S. corporations 
Any loan or investment acquired by a nonbank financial insti-
tution after June 30, 1968, that involves the advance of funds to a 
domestic corporation which is simply a financing conduit (commonly known 

4.35 9 
-16-
as a "Delaware sub"), and which in turn will transmit the funds to a 
foreign business, should be reported as a foreign asset if one or more 
foreigners own a majority of the stock of the "Delaware" corporation. 
The amounts of such foreign loans or investments should be classified 
according to the country where the funds are actually to be used, not 
according to the residence of the owners of the "Delaware" corporation. 
In the event that U. S. residents hold a majority ownership 
interest in the "Delaware" corporation, no part of a loan or investment 
in such a corporation is to be regarded as a foreign asset of the insti-
tution. 
ligasing of physical goods 
The foreign leasing activities of firms which engage primarily 
in the leasing of physical assets (e.g., computers, real property, ships, 
aircraft), and which are not owned or controlled by a U. S. financial 
institution, are not reportable under the nonbank program. However, 
such activities are reportable when they are undertaken by nonbank 
financial institutions. These institutions should report the book value 
Â°f any physical assets leased to foreigners on the appropriate line of 
the quarterly form they file with their Federal Reserve Bank. 
Investment in certain foreign Insurance ventures 
Net investment in foreign insurance ventures should be reported 
as such wherever possible. In the case of any such ventures in which 
there is no segregated net investment, the U. S. insurance company may 
e*clude from its foreign assets investments within the foreign country 
involved, in amounts up to 110 per cent of reserves accumulated on in-

4360 
-17-
surance sold to residents of that country, or (if it is larger) the 
minimum deposit of cash or securities required as a condition of doing 
insurance business within that country. 
Lon^-term credits to developing-country subsidiaries of U. S. corporations 
Institutions are requested to discuss with their Federal 
Reserve Bank in advance any future long-term loans or direct security 
placements that would involve extensions of credit of $500,000 or more 
to private business borrowers located in the developing countries. 
Reporting requirement 
Each nonbank financial institution holding, on any quarterly 
reporting date, covered assets of $500,000 or more, or total foreign 
financial assets of $5 million or more, is requested to file a statistical 
report covering its total holdings on that date with the Federal Reserve 
Bank of the Federal Reserve district in which its principal office is 
located. The reports are due within 20 days following the close of 
each calendar quarter, and forms may be obtained by contacting the 
Federal Reserve Bank. 
Institutions with holdings below these levels, although not 
requested to file formal reports, are also expected to abide by the pro-
visions of the program. 
Â£overed assets in excess of ceiling 
For some institutions, repatriation of liquid funds, cessation 
new investment in the developed countries of continental Western 
Europe, and restraint on reinvestment of other covered assets was not 
sufficient to result in achievement during 1968 of the year-end target 

4361 
P. 
- lu -
ceilmg specified under the 1968 program. In most such instances, 
there may have been special circumstances--such as the existence at 
year-end 196/ of firm commitments to invest, the need to accommodate 
requests for the b^na fide financing of U. S. exports, or the nonmarketable 
nature of the institution's holdings. Nevertheless, every institution 
whose December 31, 1 68, holdings of covered assets exceed 5 per cent 
>-'f its ad usted base-date holdings sh uld review its situation with 
Its Federal Reserve ank with a view to working out an individually 
tailored program for achieving a maximum reduction in the institJtion's 
covered foreign assets consistent with the guideline ceiling during 1969. 
In view of the balance of payments objectives of the program, 
it is noted that covered investments of nonbank financial institutions 
may be permitted to exceed the guideline ceiling to the extent that the 
funds for such investment are borrowed abroad for investment in the same 
country or in countries that are subject to the same or more liberal 
guideline limitations. Thus, funds borrowed in the developed countries 
Â°f cont.nental Western Europe may be used to finance investments in 
these countries and elsewhere, and funds borrowed in other developed 
countries (except Canada and Japan) may be used to finance investment 
in covered foreign assets anywhere but in the developed countries of 
continental Western Europe. Any institution desiring to offset foreign 
borrowing against foreign investment, however, should discuss its plans 
with the Federal Reserve Bank before entering into such an arrangement.
