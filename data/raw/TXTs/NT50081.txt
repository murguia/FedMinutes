Application of Huntington Bancshares (Items 1 and 2). 
There 
had h

 approval on April 25, 1967, of the application of Huntington

The issuance of the order and statement was authorized.

Processing of merger and holding company applications (Item 
At the meeting on December 12, 1966, consideration was given 
t o
 a proposed letter to the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
Poking toward further improvement in the processing of bank merger 
a
nd bank holding company applications, basically through closer cooper-
a t i
-on among the examination, research, and legal functions at the Banks 
a n <
i through better coordination of staff work at the Banks and the 
Board. However, action was deferred pending exploration of certain 
a s
Pects of the matter. 
A revised draft letter had now been distributed. 
Among the procedures dealt with was the clearance of proposed 
^
i e
l d statistical surveys. Alternative language was included in the 
Pr
°Posed letter: 
one version would require the approval of the Board's 
V i s i o n of Examinations prior to initiation of such a survey; the 
°
ttler
 would call for consultation among the examination and research 
staff 
at both the Reserve Bank concerned and the Board. 
Governor Brimmer expressed a preference for the second alterna-
t e

tt:
itude of cooperation between the Reserve Banks and the Board.

Unanimous approval was then given to the transmittal of a

Response to reserve requirement reduction. 
There had been dis-
t r
ibuted a memorandum dated May 18, 1967, from the Division of Research 
llu
 statistics proposing that q. study be made of member bank response 
t 
-
he reduction in reserve requirements earlier this year. 
The study would trace bank uses of released reserves as 
ref i 
ected in changes in excess reserves and borrowings, shifts of depos-
its t 
0
 and from correspondents, purchases and sales of Federal funds, 
and u 11 -j 
cimately expansion of earning assets. 
The memorandum enumerated 
r t a
i n issues that might be clarified by such a study and pointed out 
one of the by-products would be an organization of data that would 
ate continuing analysis of bank reactions not only to changes 
res 
r
ve requirements but to open market operations, shifts in Trea-
g ^ y a 
Private balances around tax payment and financing dates, and 
between time and demand deposits.

The feasibility of the project had been dis-

take 
t h e 
work of data organization, programming, and data processing.

d
ata on reserves carried, as shown on the books of the Reserve Banks, 
a n d
 (2) to bring selected Reserve Bank technicians into the planning 
the proposed reorganization of data on a continuing basis. 
The 
memorandum indicated, in the latter regard, that a specific program 
w
ould be submitted to the Board for consideration as soon as planning 
a t
 staff level was completed. 
Governor Mitchell asked the staff to identify the information 
r e
quired for the study that was not already available at the Board's 
o f
flees, and M r . Fry replied that the only body of information not on 
hand i n S o m e

d o 
w i t h 
r e s e r v e s carried (for computation of

Other types of informa-

ate editing would be required. 
G o v e r n o r M i t c h e l l then i n q u i r e d about c o m p u t e r c a p a c i t y , and 
Mr 
aiger replied that computer capacity was available. Also, per-
n n
e l had been assigned to work on the editing of data that were 
e s
ently on hand. 
The addition of the data on reserves carried, when 
c 
V e

Work i

Would k

tor. st •

Governor Mitchell then said he would like the record to show 
t h
a t he had raised the question of how much time would be required 
before the results of the study were available to the Board. M r . Brill 
r e
Plied that the initial step would be the preparation of data on mem-
b e r
 bank behavior during the first five months of 1967, and M r . Staiger 
Sai
-d that such data should be in form for analysis before the end of 
th 
e
 summer. Governor Mitchell asked whether that meant the analysis 
W
°
U l d b e
 completed by September or October, and M r . Brill said it was 
h°Ped that the analysis would be completed some time this fall. 
Governor Brimmer recalled that several days ago he had suggested 
°nsidering again the possibility for making some move under the Board's 
p r
esent statutory authority in the direction of graduated reserve 
ements. He assumed it would not be considered necessary to await 
results of the proposed study before giving serious consideration 
to siinli 
n
 action. Mr. Brill replied that the results of the study, when 
a v
ailabl 
J-e, should be of some guidance to the Board. 
However, the Board 
had 
f 
colore always taken action on reserve requirements without the 
benefit °f such data, and presumably it could do so again. 
Governor 
dimmer 
said he wanted the record to show that he would not accept the 
H t y of the study as a pre-condition to action on reserve 
^ " i r e m e n t s . 
The undertaking of the proposed study was then authorized.

Freedom of Information Act. 
Chairman Martin noted that one of 
t h
e items to be considered at tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee had to do with the application to the Committee's 
records of the Freedom of Information Act (P.L. 89-487), which would 
b
ecome effective July 4, 1967. As requested at the last meeting of 
t h
e Committee, Mr. Hackley had prepared a draft* of letter to the Attor-
n e y 
G e n
e r a l that would ask for consideration of an executive order 
exempting from the requirements of the Act all records of the Committee 
A e t h e r relating to domestic or to foreign operations, the disclosure 
o f
 which would appear to have an adverse effect upon the national 
efense or foreign policy. 
However, in a memorandum dated May 8 trans-
i t i n g the draft letter to the Chairman, M r . Hackley expressed the 
p i n
i o n that the submission of such a request would be unwise. 
Mr. 
a
c k l e y believed that many of the records of the Committee were exempt 
from 
disclosure under one or more of the exemptions contained in the 
e e
d o m of Information Act, that in other cases deferred publication 
disclosure could be defended, that a request for an executive order 
PJ-ace the Committee in the position of seeming to seek complete 
Ption from the requirements of the Act, and that denial of such a 
r
e q u e s t 
. 
m
i g h t weaken arguments for a time lag in publication or other 
di 
Closure of various Committee records. 
Chairman Martin said that after giving the matter a great deal 
of 
0 u
g h t he found himself in agreement with M r . Hackley. 
In his view, 

O f \ * 
<c,>. 
h 
5/22/67 
- 8 -
the stance of the System should be one of releasing as much information 
a s
 possible to the public. More specifically, he doubted whether the 
Committee would encounter problems if it adopted a practice of releas-
l n
g materials such as the current economic policy directive with a time 
*
a
g of 60 or 90 days. 
In fact, after reviewing the minutes of the 
Committee over a period of several years, he thought a good case could 
b e m a d e
 that the Committee would have been better off had it followed 
s u
ch a practice. 
The Chai rman said he simply wanted to put these thoughts on 
table before the Committee meeting tomorrow. He understood, 
a
*though
 h e 
w a s 
n o t
 sure, that the New York Reserve Bank held a some-
w
^
a
t d i f f e r e n t view. Nevertheless, he would not like to see the System 
a
 position where it might appear to be trying to resist the purposes 
^ the Freedom of Information Act. 
The System had been charged consis-
e t l t
ly by some parties with being more secretive than it actually was, 
in his opinion the basic approach should be one of providing even 
°
re
 information than the law required. 
t ' V , 
Governor Daane said he had no disagreement with the basic posi-
n
 stated by the Chairman. 
He, too, felt that the System should take 
thcoming approach. 
However, he believed it would be consistent 
v i t h such a stance to have a 90-day deferral in the release of mate-
r
ial 8 
s
uch as the Open Market Committee's current economic policy 
< U r e C M

The New York Reserve Bank, and the Manager of the Open

Market Account, felt that such a time lag was warranted, and that the 
r
ecord would disclose occasions when a 90-day time lag, as contrasted 
w
ith a 60-day lag, would have been significant. 
In his opinion this 
d
id not run counter to the Chairman's basic point. As to whether an 
executive order exempting the Open Market Committee's records should 
b e
 sought, he had not had an opportunity to think that problem through 
c a
refully in the light of the Chairman's remarks. 
Chairman Martin said that, apart from the question of 60 versus 
9 Q J 
Q a
y s , he felt that the Committee should not put itself in the posi-
(.j 
°n of trying to resist releasing as much information as possible to 
t h e
 P
u b
U c in an orderly way. 
He was prepared to listen with an open 
mind 
i 
co whatever problems the Account Manager might bring out in terms 
Oji a 
j 
ou-day time lag as opposed to 90 days. 
In reviewing the minutes, 
Wever, he found numerous occasions when difficulties created by 
16 S H 
mony, speeches, and comments, either by himself or others, would 
have i °een alleviated if the record had been publicly available. 
I •. i'lr:. ; 
Governor Daane agreed that there were problems of the kind the 
^airman v» i 
1 n a d
 mentioned. 
But a faster release of information might also 
a t e
 problems in terms of the manner in which the market would func-
tion anH 
u 
the effectiveness of System open market operations. 
He would 
U k e 
t o , nave more time to think the whole matter through carefully. 
Hl s 
t "Mediate reaction was that the obtaining of an executive order, 
if 
an order was available, should not be regarded as a gesture of 
S t a n c e .

Governor Robertson said it was his judgment that a request for 
ar
* executive order was likely to be turned down, and he noted that it 
w
ould be unfortunate if such a development became known. 
Chairman 
M
artin agreed. 
There ensued further discussion of the question of a 90-day 
l m e
 !ag, as compared with a 60-day lag, following which it was under-
•^£od that copies of M r . Hackley's May 8 memorandum to Chairman Martin 
w
ould be distributed to the members of the Open Market Committee for 
review prior to tomorrow's Committee meeting. 
Interagency projections of data needs. M r . Brill reported on 
recent meeting of representatives of the Federal bank supervisory 
§
e n
cies and a group of commercial bank officials concerned with long-
a n
8 e information system planning. 
Such planning was in the develop-
mental stage at commercial banks, and it was proposed that the agencies 
k e
 known the thrust of their projected economic data needs in order 
the banks might better formulate their systems. 
It was contem-
plated f-h 
cnat another meeting would be held in October with a larger 
group of 
commercial bank representatives, at which time the supervisory 
s would lay out for the group in more detail the direction in 
l t
 was thought their data needs would be going over the next 
S e v e r
« l years. 
•Ln response to a question from Governor Mitchell as to the role 
0 f
 the Ro 
reserve Banks, Mr. Brill said he planned to inform the System 

5/22/67

Research Advisory Committee of the project at the Committee's meeting 
tomorrow. 
The objective thus far had been to get the project in 
Process in an informal atmosphere. 
Ceiling rates. At Chairman Martin's request, Governor Robertson 
commented on the meeting to be held this afternoon at the Board's 
offices with Chairman Horne of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Chair-
m a n 
R a n
d a l l of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and others 
concerning ceiling rates on savings deposits and share accounts. 
Gov-
Robertson said he had made it clear to Chairman Horne, who 
r e
quested the meeting, that the Board would have no position. 
Thus, 
t l l e m e e
t i n g would be for the purpose of listening to such proposals as 
Horne might wish to describe. 
(Note: 
A memorandum on the meeting 
l s
 being placed in the Board's files.) 
Separate and distinct from this afternoon's meeting, Governor 
°bertson continued, he had prepared a memorandum (copies distributed 
under Haf 
uate of May 18, 1967) suggesting a restructuring of Regulation Q 
ceiij-
gs. The purpose of the memorandum was not to bring the Board to 
Position at any given time, but rather to express his thinking on 
h e
 subject for the Board's consideration. 
Chairman Martin said that he had found the memorandum stimulat-
ing a_j provocative and that it would be helpful in developing the 
B o a
r d « 8 
s
 views on the subject.

Foreign assets control (Item No. 4). M r . O'Connell stated that 
the p6(j 
e r
a l Reserve Bank of New York had requested authorization to 

5/22/67 
-12-
transmit to the Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, informa-
tion regarding apparent violations of the foreign assets control regu-
lations. The possible violations, which were noted during an examina-
tion of Bankers Trust Company, New York, New York, related to trade 
a c c
eptances discounted by the bank involving shipments of goods from 
N
°rth Vietnam, North Korea, and China into Japan. 
Transmittal of the information was authorized. A copy of the 
le t" f-
e
r sent to the Director, Foreign Assets Control, is attached as 
The meeting then moved to the Conference Room adjoining the 
0 a r d
 Room for further discussion of questions with respect to the pro-
Posed annex building. 
All of the members of the Board were in attend-
n c e
 along with M r . Shepardson, Consultant to the Board. The architec-
tural f-f 
U r m of Harbeson Hough Livingston & Larson was represented by 
Meg q*.

Annex building. Mr. Shepardson recalled that the general 
g n
 °f the Board's proposed annex building had been presented to the 
^ine A r t 
C s
 Commission and that the Commission had raised some questions 
w t t h 
r e
gard to the roof treatment. 
Also, in view of the desire that 
h a d
 been p 
expressed by some members of the Board that consideration be 
81ve n 
t

 including an additional floor in the building, that possibility

w
as presented to the Fine Arts Commission, and no strongly adverse 
faction was evident. 
In the circumstances, the architects had pre-
Pared new sketches and models for a building of four working floors 
Plus a set-back floor, and with a new roof design. 
These materials 
W e r
e on display. 
Mr. Larson then described the revised plans in some detail with 
t h e
 aid of the sketches and other materials, following which he and his 
a s
s o c i a t e s r e s p o n d e d to a n u m b e r of q u e s t i o n s raised by m e m b e r s of the 
Board 
t 
i 
• 
in reply to one question, Mr. Ward estimated that the extra 
0 s t
 attributable to the additional working floor would be in the area 
^ - 1 / 2 million. 
In response to another question, Messrs. Larson and 
Ward p i 
^ P l a i n e d why they felt it would be inadvisable for the length of 
building to be reduced, particularly in view of the addition of the 
6 X t r a
 floor. 
During a discussion of functions that might be housed in the 
n e
* building, Governor Maisel suggested that consideration be given 
c
°usolidating the Board's dining room and cafeteria facilities on 
the t 
°P (set-back) floor, which would then be utilized entirely for 
that

r
Pose and the reception-meeting room areas previously contem-

Mr. Shepardson then presented a question relating to the posi-
tioning of stairs that would lead from the podium on the east side of 
e
 annex building toward a fountain that the National Park Service 
Proposed to install on the triangular plot of ground bounded by 
Viro* • Avenue and C Street. 
The original concept had been that the 
S t 
* 
l
rs would be recessed back into the podium of the annex building, 
b u t
 the architects now recommended that the stairs be extended so that 
t h
ey would run onto a part of the area under the control of the National 
Park 
service• 
Mr. Shepardson showed sketches of the revised proposal 
expressed his understanding that if the Board and the National Park 
e r
vice could agree on it, the National Capital Planning Commission 
W o u
l d concur. 
There was general agreement that negotiations should be con-
c t
e d W i t h the National Park Service with a view to obtaining consent 
the revised plan. Governors Mitchell and Brimmer suggested that 
egotiations include an offer on the part of the Board to pay the 
the fountain as well as the landscaping of the triangular plot, 
thus 
a s „ s u r m g that the total scheme would be worked out to the satis-
facti 
°n of the Board and its architects. 
There was general agreement 
V i t
h thi 
n i s
 suggestion.

Mr. Shepardson noted that, as he had informed members of the 
5 t h e
 Department of the Interior had determined that it would not 
6 t" 
i 
obtain funds, directly or indirectly, for construction of 

204 
5/22/67 
-15-
the so-called north garage under the area between Virginia Avenue and 
the northern boundary of the annex building site. 
He understood that 
consideration was now being given to the possibility of constructing, 
Partly under that area, a garage that would be operated on a commercial 
basis by private i n t e r e s t s . 
M U h i 
Chairman Martin and Governor Robertson withdrew from the meet-
i n
S at this point. 
As the discussion continued, Governor Brimmer inquired whether 
it a appeared that the Interior Department could negotiate a long-term 
lease for the use of a garage if it was constructed by the Board, and 
ernor Mitchell said it was his impression that the Interior Depart-
ment d -i ri 
a
i a not believe it would be able to enter into such an arrangement. 
Shepardson pointed out that if Board members wanted to reopen for 
er consideration the whole question of construction of the north 
r a
g e with Board funds, that was, of course, their prerogative. 
Gov-
n
°r Daane i n d i c a t e d that he t h o u g h t r e c o n s i d e r a t i o n of the q u e s t i o n

betwe e n ^ Street and Virginia Avenue, and Governor Brimmer expressed 
°Pinion that further negotiation with the Interior Department on 
s
om e ba • 
sis would be in order. Governor Sherrill commented that the 
investm e n
t in the north garage might be warranted if it would result 
in 
e
 Board's o b t a i n i n g p r o t e c t i o n in terms of the future d e v e l o p m e n t 
the si h 
Governor Mitchell also expressed the view that the 

2045 
5/22/67 
-16-
Provision of the additional parking space would be warranted to protect 
the development of the site as a whole. Governor Brimmer inquired 
w
hether it might not be possible to charge Interior Department person-
a l for parking in the garage, and Governor Mitchell said he thought 
s
ome arrangement probably could be worked out whereby the Board could 
obtain a return equivalent to the cost of operating the north garage. 
At the conclusion of the discussion it was understood: 
(1) that 
th 
e
 revised design of the annex building as prepared by the architects 
w
°uld be submitted to the Fine Arts Commission; (2) that the architects' 
r e
commended treatment for the stairs on the east side of the annex 
Gilding would be presented to the National Park Service with an offer 
t b a
t under such a plan the Board would be willing to finance the instal-
13. t" i 
0 n
 of a fountain and the landscaping of the triangular plot to the 
a s t
 of the annex building; and (3) that if members of the Board wished

OF THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
APPLICATION OF 
HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED 
COLUMBUS, OHIO, 
TO BECOME A BANK HOLDING COMPANY 
STATEMENT 
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Columbus, Ohio ("Applicant"),

 filed with the Board, pursuant to section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding 
Com 
Pany Act of 1956, as amended, an application for approval of action

ore of the voting shares of The Washington Savings Bank, Washington

Applicant controls The Huntington National Bank of Columbus, 
C

 operated 16 offices 
as of December 31, 1966 f~^

Statutory considerations, - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
that the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in 
3 m o n
°poly, or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy 
t 0 m o n
o p o l i z e or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in 
9 n y
 P
Q r
t of the United States. Nor may the Board approve a proposed 
a c c
luisition, the effect of which, in any section of the country, may 
e
 substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, 
r w
nich in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless 
the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed 
ty 
f a c t i o n are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable 
effect r\c (.l 
or the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the 
L
^unity to be served. 
In each case the Board is required to take 
consideration the financial and managerial resources and future 
into 
Pros 
the 
Pects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, and 
convenience and needs of the community to be served. 
C o m p e t i t i v e e f f e c t of proposed t r a n s a c t i o n . - S l i g h t l y in

 of 50 per cent of the deposits held by all banks in Ohio are 
Contraii 
*led by the State's 13 largest banking organizations. 
Applicant 
tankg 11 
*lth in size of these organizations with control of 2 per cent 
S U c
h deposits. 
Consunnation of this proposal would add less than 
of 
Per cent to the deposits under Applicant's control and those 
t r
° H e d by the aforementioned banking organizations. 
Applicant's 
a t
i v e size position would remain unchanged. 

- 3 -
2051 
The two bank holding companies presently operating in Ohio 
rank third and fifth among the banking organizations and together 
i 
c
°ntrol about 10 per cent of the deposits in the State. 
Consummation 
o f
 A p p U c ant's proposal would increase holding company control of 
d e
posits to about 12 per cent. 
The foregoing data indicate that 
consummation of Applicant's 
Proposal will not result in any significant change in the control of 
banking resources by Ohio's large banking organizations, including 
^snk holding companies. On the basis of the aforestated data and 
o t
her relevant facts of record, the Board concludes that Applicant's 
a c c
|uisiticn of Savings Bank would not result in a monopoly, or be in 
^
u
rtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt 
t o
 Monopolize the business of banking in any relevant area of the State. 
Huntington Bank is located in, and generally serves, Franklin 
c
°
u
nty. Applicant's proposal involves no significant change in the 
®
e t
hod and scope of Huntington Bank's operations. 
Savings Bank, 
*"°
c
ated in Fayette County, one county removed from Franklin County, 
d
°
e s n
°t compete in the latter county. Huntington Bank draws but a 
^ o r portion of its business (.2 per cent of its total deposits and 
•°
5
 Per cent of its loans) from Fayette County, Savings Bank's primary 
S e r
vice area.-^ 
The deposits thus derived have been in the form of 
C e r t
lficates of deposit 
on which Huntington Bank pays a higher rate

o f
 interest than does Savings Bank. Analyses of the loan portfolios 
the two proposed subsidiary banks indicate 
that Huntington Bank 
makes few farm loans, while such loans constitute a substantial portion 
of Savings Bank's loan business. On the basis of the foregoing data, 
a n
d considering that under Ohio law intercounty branching is prohibited, 
Board concludes that present competition between Huntington Bank 
a n d 
S a v
i n g s Bank is insignificant and that potential for competition 
between the two banks is minimal. 
On the basis of the evidence of record,the Board concludes 
that consummation of Applicant's proposal would have no measurable 
a d v
e r s e competitive effect on other banks in Franklin or Fayette 
C o u
n t i e s . 
As earlier stated, the proposal will result in no change 
n
 Huntington Bank's operation. As to the impact in Fayette County 
of t h . 
proposal, Savings Bank presently holds deposits ($12 million), 
1* A 
esenting 20 per cent of the deposits of banks competing in Fayette 
U t l t y
»
 
w
h i c h is Savings Bank's primary service area. 
It ranks second 
deposit size to The First National Bank of Washington Court House, 
a K 
a n
 
holding company subsidiary, with $13 million in deposits, 
e s
enting 22 per cent of the deposits of banks competing in the 
Ar
»e remaining bank located in Fayette County, formed by a recent 
Merger

t w o
 banks, operates two offices holding total deposits of 
^ 
million. Seven other banks located outside Fayette County 
CooiPete therein. These banks, located nine to sixteen miles from 
S^yj 
3
 Bank's office, hold deposits ranging from less than 

2053 
-5-
million to almost $10 million. Consummation of Applicant's proposal, 
^hile placing both banks in Washington Court House under bank holding 
company control, would not reduce the number of banking alternatives. 
Rather, Savings Bank should become a far more effective competitor 
utu
*er Applicant's ownership. There would remain available to the 
residents of the Washington Court House area services of the locally-owned 
independent bank, which proposes to establish a third office near 
W a
shington Court House. 
In summary the Board concludes that Applicant's acquisition 
o f
 Savings Bank would not result in a substantial lessening of 
competition, tend to create a monopoly, or be in restraint of trade 
l n
 any relevant area. 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. -
^PPlicant has been in operation since 1966 and owns a controlling 
l n t
eregt i n but one bank, Huntington Bank. 
Despite its brief history, 
A
PPlicant's financial condition appears satisfactory and its prospects, 
b a s
e d principally upon the satisfactory condition of Huntington Bank, 
a
Ppear favorable, as do the prospects of Huntington Bank. 
Applicant's 
P r i n c i
P a l executive officers and the members of its board of directors 
S 6 t V e
 in similar capacities with Huntington Bank. The management 
f b
°th institutions is considered satisfactory. 
Savings Bank, opened in 1907 and reorganized in 1933, is 
i n S a
t i 3 f a c t o r y f i n a n c i a i condition. 
Its prospects, however, are less 
f a v
o r a b l e # 
Savings Bank, with a history of sound but conservative 
a
gement, is presently faced with a serious need for capable executive 

2054 
-6-
m
anagement and potential successor management. 
In December 1966, the 
chief operating officer died and was replaced by a former official, 
80 
years of age, who, because of a serious illness, is no longer with 
'h® bank. The bank's management is presently the responsibility of 
at
* assistant treasurer who is assisted on a part-time basis by a 
r e
tired druggist, near 80 years of age, who is now president and chair-
®
ar
> of the bank. 
It is readily apparent that Savings Bank has a pressing 
n e
ed for experienced executive management, and that there is no 
real likelihood that such personnel can be secured under present 
ov,nership. 
Applicant proposes, if this application is approved, to 
Place in the bank executive personnel having qualifications and 
e x
Perience paralleling that of the personnel in the Huntington Bank. 
i s
 the Board's judgment that Applicant's proposal offers an 
M e d i a t e and certain resolution to the serious management problem 
i n
 Savings Bank a<i that, under Applicant's ownership, Savings Bank's 
Prospects would be considerably more favorable than they are at 
Present, This consideration weighs significantly in favor of 
a
PProval of Applicant's proposal. 
Convenience and needs of area involved. - As earlier indi-
cated 
» Applicant's acquisition of Savings Bank should have little or 
n 0 
e c f 
i r
e c t on the service Huntington Bank now provides. 
It is now 
l n
g > and will continue to serve, the major banking requirements 
of it-
c a
 customers, principally located in the Columbus-Franklin County 
a
r e a . 

2055

H 
As to the likely effect on the primary service area of 
Savings Bank, Fayette County is essentially a rural and agricultural 
a
rea. Washington Court House, located 50 miles southwest of Columbus, 
i s
 the county seat and situs of Savings Bank's offices. Until mid-1950, 
tl
»e business establishments of Washington Court House were essentially 
a retail and service character. 
In the ensuing period, several 
•Nationally known companies have established factories in a newly-
developed 95-acre industrial park, resulting in continuously increasing 
industrial employment and increased residential construction. 
The 
record sustains Applicant's stated belief for continued economic 
growth of the area. 
While Savings Bank has shown a competitive attitude with 
t e
spect to the community's need for a place of deposit of funds, it 
h a s 
n
°t shown similar response to the credit requirements presented 
by the economic and residential expansion of the area. 
Savings Bank 
declined to make FHA or VA insured mortgage loans, or any type 
home improvement loan. Mortgage loans are made on a highly con-
S e
rvative basis, as a result of which the bank has made only a small 
Pet* 
cent of the total recorded real estate loans in the county. 
Savings 
has also been ultraconservative in its policy toward automobile 
Qfc i 
consumer loans. 
These policies explain in large measure Savings 
Hank'o 
8
 present low loan to deposit ratio of 23 per cent. 
Applicant states its intention, if control of Savings Bank 
i8 acquired, to expand the bank's mortgage, home improvement, auto-
niobn 
t e
» and consumer loan programs, and to commit Savings Bank to 

2056

greater participation In the financing of local political subdivisions 
(only 5 per cent of Savings Bank's present portfolio is represented 
b y F a
y e t t e County municipal issues). Moreover, Applicant is also 
• 
c
onsiderlng the establishment of an additional branch office to 
s
sure more convenient service to the community. The assurance of 
assistance to Savings Bank with respect to expanded services, and 
Provision of management personnel offered by Applicant's proposal, 
\\ . 
. 
Provides a reasonable likelihood that Savings Bank will emerge a full 
crvice institution better able 
to serve the convenience and needs 
the community. 
Accordingly, considerations relating to convenience 
I n , ! 
needs of the community are viewed as favorable to approval of the 
^Plication. 
Conclusion. - On the basis of all the relevant facts 
c
°ntained in the record, and in light of the factors set forth in 
sil'.'i 
S e c
t i o n 3(c) of the Act, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
ansaetion would be consistent with the public Interest and that the 
^Plication should be approved.

May 26, 1967. 
Dear Sir: 
• 
While quality arid timeliness in the processing of merger 
a n c i
 holding company applications have been improved at the Board 
a
nd the Reserve Banks as experience has been gained, the Board- feels 
a t
 more improvement is needed. 
It is believed the suggestions 
lJ
tlined below can be helpful in this direction, and the Beard will 
PpJ.'eciate your taking the necessary steps to implement them promptly 
at y°ur Bank. 
Stated broadly, it in desirable to have close and systematic 
^PQration and a free flow of comments, information, and suggestions 
' among the examinations, research, and legal functions at the 
•serve Banks, and (b) between these functions and their counterparts 
t
^e Board of Governors. 
The value of such cooperation tnd 
r
oination has been demonstrated by the experience of the various 
groups within the Board's own staff. 
jj. 
More specifically, it will be appreciated if, in all 
Co
 
r
 
company applications, except those vhere anti-
y 0 P°titive factors are essentially inconsequential, you will have 
Research Department prepare a memorandum evaluating the ccmpet-
situation and the convenience and needs aspects. 
This 
Ju
 
l
*
nnc
^»m should be included in the materials forwarded to the 
u
> and it should be taken into account by your Examination 
are
 
t R l e n t : 
i n 
i t s
 processing of the application. 
In the event there 
s i
Gnificant differences of opinion between the two departments, 
the
 
l > e
 helpful if each viewpoint could be fully presented in 
c
 H $ h t of the other, so that the issues may be weighed as fully 
8
 Possible. 

o n e r 
S-2018 
If, after a preliminary review, it seems desirable to make 
field statistical surveys regarding such matters as service area, 
deposit accounts, customer preferences, and similar aspects of local 
banking markets, such surveys should be conducted only after consulta-
tion among the examinations and research staffs at both the Reserve 
Bank and the Board, 
The Bank's Research Department should then, in 
consultation with the Board's Banking Markets Section, actively 
Participate in the formulation and conduct of such surveys. 
It is also desirable that the Reserve Bank s Legal Depart-
ment assist as fully as possible in the evaluation and processing of 
applications, especially in cases with important competitive aspects. 
, 
There is attached a copy of a memorandum dated June 23, 19 66, 
Processing Merger and Holding Company Applications in the Division of 
Examinations," which has previously been sent to the Vice Presidents 
charge of Examinations at all Reserve Banks. 
The procedures set 
C u
t in the memorandum have helped to bring about closer cooperation 
and coordination at the Board among the Division of Examinations, the 
L c
g a l Division, and the Banking Markets Section of the Division of 
^search & Statistics, and between the Board's Division of Examinations 
a n c l
 the Examination Departments of the Reserve Banks, 
Somewhat similar 
Procedures may prove helpful at your Bank. 
The Board will welcome any suggestions for further improve-
ment in the processing of merger and holding company applications. 
Very truly yours,

following format is to be used in all cases. 
^Ip^ose^. - state this very briefly; include a statement as to the 
premium or discount involved. 
Follow with a very short paragraph giving a capsule version 
of the location and economy of the relevant area(s). 
Unless it clearly would not be helpful, include a map indi-
cating the relevant area(s). 
Have the map attached at the 
end of the mc-morandum, but call attention to it in the 
paragraph requested above. 
&H2^titive Factor. - Indicate Division's conclusions as to the rela-
tionship of the case to the tests (essentially identical) 
set out for mergers in amended section 18(c)(5) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act and for holding company 
cases in amended section 3(c) of the Bank Holding Company 
Act. 
(See EX-112 cf March 9 , 1966, and EX-121 of June 23, 
1966.) 
Discussion should cover the three aspects: 
(1) competition 
between the banks involved, (2) other competitive effects, 
and (3) concentration. 
In merger cases, the final paragraph should state in briefest 
possible terms the conclusions'reached in the competitive 
factor reports.

indication of what the financial needs are, as well as how 
conveniently they are being served.
