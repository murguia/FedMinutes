Report on competitive factors. A report on the competitive 
factors involved in the proposed merger of Central National Bank and 
Trust Company of Enid, Enid, Oklahoma, with Broadway National Bank of 
Enid, Enid, Oklahoma, was approved unanimously for transmittal to the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the conclusion stating that consummation 
of the proposed merger (which was merely a transaction to facilitate 
the acquisition of Central National Bank and Trust Company by Central 
Service Corporation, Enid, Oklahoma, a newly-formed holding company) 
would have no adverse competitive effects. 
Regulation Z. The issuance of three interpretations, as proposed 
by the staff, of provisions of Regulation Z, Truth in Lending, was 
authorized by unanimous vote. Copies of the interpretations, as issued, 
are attached under Item No. 1. 
Call report forms. A letter to the Federal Reserve Banks with 
regard to forms to be used by State member banks and their affiliates 
in submitting reports of condition as of the next call date was approved 
unanimously. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 2. 
Mortgage lending practices. In a letter of May 29, 1969, the 
Acting Staff Director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights 
advised that the Commission had been engaged for some time in a study 
°f the housing problems of minority group families, particularly those 
°f low and moderate income. A part of the study was said to be concerned 
with the impact of the policies and practices of Federal agencies having 
responsibilities with respect to mortgage lending institutions, including 

1999 
6/20/69 
-3-
member banks of the Federal Reserve System, in opening up housing 
opportunities to minority group families throughout metropolitan areas. 
In order to evaluate the policies and practices of the Board of Governors 
for purposes of the study, a number of questions were asked. 
A draft of reply had been distributed with a memorandum from 
Messrs. O'Connell, Fisher, and Leavitt dated June 18, 1969. Also 
distributed was a substitute draft of answer to one of the questions, 
prepared following consultation with Governor Maisel. 
The staff reported having seen a draft of the reply being made 
by the Comptroller of the Currency to a similar letter from the Acting 
Staff Director of the Commission. The Comptroller's answers to the 
questions directed to him were more succinct than the answers proposed 
to be made by the Board, and it was understood that the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation was planning to reply in about the same fashion. 
However, the staff noted that the answers proposed for use by the Board 
were consistent with the answers made to somewhat similar inquiries on 
several previous occasions. The staff also pointed out that the answers 
Proposed for use by the Board had been prepared in relation to State 
member banks only, although the incoming letter referred to member banks 
generally. 
The proposed reply was reviewed by the Board in some detail, 
a n d a number of questions bearing upon provisions of Title VIII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1968, practices followed in checking for possible 
vi-olations in the examination of banks, and enforcement responsibilities

were dealt with by the staff. During the discussion the difficulty of 
establishing evidence of violations of the law was noted, particularly 
since most banks did not maintain files on loan applications denied. 
Board members expressed the view that everything possible should be 
done to encourage bank examiners to be alert to the provisions of the 
law and indications of possible violation thereof, and it was suggested 
that the subject be covered at sessions of the schools for bank examiners 
conducted at the Board's offices. 
The discussion resulted in acceptance of the substitute answer 
to one of the questions that had been prepared at the suggestion of 
Governor Maisel, as well as agreement on language changes in the answers 
to some of the other questions. 
Unanimous approval then was given to the sending of a reply in 
the form attached as Item No. 3. 
Consultants. In a letter dated June 3, 1969, Chairman Patman 
of the House Committee on Banking and Currency had requested the names 
of all economists who had served as consultants to the Board of Governors 
and the Federal Reserve Banks during the years from 1959 to date, along 
with information on the amount of compensation paid to such persons. 
There had been distributed under date of June 12, 1969, a 
proposed reply transmitting information on economists who had served 
as consultants to the Board and advising that similar information with 
respect to economists who had served as consultants to Federal Reserve 
Banks would be provided as soon as the information was collected and 
compiled. 

6/20/69 
-5-
There was some discussion as to whether the information proposed 
to be transmitted (which provided, by years, only the name of each 
consultant and the total amount of the fees paid to him) should be 
expanded, perhaps by identifying the consultants more precisely or by 
indicating the purpose or purposes for which their services had been 
retained. The consensus was that such expansion did not appear to be 
necessary. However, it was agreed that the letter to Chairman Patman 
should describe in general terms the nature of undertakings in which 
the services of the consultants were utilized. Mr. Partee was requested 
to have a member of his staff work with the Division of Personnel Admin-
istration in revising the transmittal letter along the lines indicated. 
It was also suggested that the information transmitted might 
make clear that some of the economists who had been retained as consultants 
were retired Board employees. 
Subject to the foregoing understandings, the sending of the 
requested information to Chairman Patman with regard to economists 
who had served as consultants to the Board was approved unanimously. 
(Note: A copy of the reply subsequently sent to Chairman Patman 
is attached as Item No. 4.) 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Officer salaries at Atlanta. A letter to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Atlanta approving the payment of salary to four newly-appointed officers, 

6/20/69 
-6-
in each case at the annual rate of $14,000, effective July 1, 1969, 
was approved unanimously. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 5. 
Regulation U matter. The Board was advised that in connection 
with an investigation by a grand jury in the New York City area of 
certain alleged violations of Regulation U, Credit by Banks for the 
Purpose of Purchasing or Carrying Margin Stocks, the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York was preparing to present 
evidence that might result in the bringing of an indictment against 
the Franklin National Bank. As part of the case, the District Attorney 
desired to show that certain reports by the bank to an agency of the 
U.S. Government, namely the Board of Governors, had been filled out 
improperly. Accordingly, he was seeking to have a representative of 
the Federal Reserve System, probably an officer of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, appear before the grand jury, identify a blank copy 
of the report submitted by weekly reporting member banks, and testify 
that that report had been submitted by the national bank during the weeks 
that certain loans were outstanding. 
In discussion, it was noted that although the Board might have 
the power to require the weekly report, at present it was furnished on 
a voluntary basis and was used solely for statistical purposes. Appre-
hension was expressed by Board members that use of the weekly report for 
a purpose such as the U.S. District Attorney had in mind might exacerbate 
the problem involved in obtaining the cooperation of member banks in 
filing reports on a voluntary basis that were useful to the Federal 

ZiWS

Reserve in discharging its responsibilities. Question was raised 
whether the objective of the District Attorney could not be achieved 
in some different way, and in that connection reference was made to 
certain information included in the report of condition, which was of 
course a report required to be filed by banks pursuant to law. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, it was understood that an 
effort would be made by Federal Reserve representatives to point out 
to the District Attorney's office the reason why reluctance existed 
toward having a report of the kind in question used for a purpose such 
as the District Attorney had in mind, in which connection the hope would 
be expressed that some other procedure could be found that would serve 
the District Attorney's purpose. It was understood that if necessary 
in the light of developments the staff would bring the matter back to 
the Board for further consideration. 
All members of the staff except Mr. Holland then withdrew from 
the meeting. 
System Research Advisory Committee. Governor Sherrill presented 
to the Board a memorandum concerning the chairmanship of the System 
Research Advisory Committee that had been prepared under date of May 16, 
1969, by Mr. Brill as Senior Adviser to the Board and Director of the 
Division of Research and Statistics. In the memorandum Mr. Brill pointed 
out that the Board's senior staff economist in the domestic field, who 
was usually also the Director of the Division of Research and Statistics,

had traditionally been named by the Board to serve as the Chairman 
of the Committee. Accordingly, it was recommended that Mr. Partee 
be appointed by the Board as Chairman of the Advisory Committee and 
that the Federal Reserve Banks be notified accordingly. 
The recommendation was approved unanimously.

Dear Sir: 
The required supply of copies of the following forms 
is being forwarded to your Bank under separate cover for use 
of member State banks and their affiliates for submitting reports 
as of the next call date. A copy of each form is attached for 
your information. 
Form FR 105 (Call 192 revised June 1969), Report of 
Condition of State member banks. 
Form FR 105 Schedule B, Report of Par Value of Securities 
Issued by U.S. Treasury and Other U.S. Government 
Agencies. 
Form FR 105 Schedule K, Supplemental Information on 
Trading Accounts Securities and Federal Funds Sold 
and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell. 
Form 105e (revised April 1969), Publisher's copy of 
Report of Condition of State member banks. 
Form FR 105e-l (revised April 1969), Publisher's copy 
of Report of Condition of State member banks. 
Form FR 220 (revised September 1966), Report of an

Form FR 220a (revised September 1966), Publisher's 
copy of Report of an Affiliate. 
Form FR 105a (revised June 1969), Instructions for 
Preparation of Reports of Condition by State member 
banks. 
The face of the Report of Condition is the same as that 
used for the April 1969 call date and reflects the changes in 
r°porting and publication procedures that v;ere in effect for 
that call. The detailed schedules of loans and deposits on the 
back of the form usually reouired for June and December call

dates are included for this call date. The Comptroller of the 
Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will 
require reports from national and insured nonmember State banks 
which are identical in all substantive requirements. 
A few minor changes have been made in the instructions 
prevailing for the April call date for purposes of clarity. 
These clarifying changes reflect comments received from the 
Federal Reserve Banks on the basis of experience with the 
April call and negotiations with the other Federal bank super-
visory agencies on the final instructions. 
Instructions for 
the detailed schedules of loans and deposits are essentially 
the same as those in the previous instruction booklet. 
Some 
minor changes were made for clarification and additional 
c-aterial was added for more specific instructions on the re-
quired treatment of (1) loans purchased under agreements to 
resell and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and (2) 
"Bookkeepers throwouts" and "Dealers reserves." The latter 
was added at the request of the FDIC. 
Specific instructions for reporting the new breakdown 
of residential real estate mortgages that become effective with 
this call have also been included. The revised schedule requires 
reporting of real estate mortgages on residential properties 
broken down between (1) 1 to 4 family residential properties by 
type of mortgage (FKA, VA, and conventional), and (2) real 
estate mortgages on multi-family residential properties by type 
of mortgage (FtlA and conventional). 
Schedule B for reporting the par value of U.S. Treasury 
and Federal Agency Securities by issue has been revised from 
the form used in June I960 to exclude trading account securities. 
Therefore, the total book value items reported in Schedule B 
will continue to be the same as the corresponding items on the 
face of the Report of Condition. Minor changes in the classifica-
tion of securities in this Schedule (ana in the Report of Condition 
have also been made. Federal Housing Administration debentures 
and District of Columbia Stadium bonds should now be reported 
with Federal Agency securities rather than with Treasury securities 
A new Schedule K will be used for reporting the breakdown 
of Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agree-
ments according to the other party to the transactions. 
This 
Information was previously required as part of the Memoranda 
section on the back of the report. Schedule K also requires a 

breakdown of trading account securities by type of security in 
the same detail as is required in the investment security items 
on the face of the Report. 
This information is needed to main-
tain statistical series relating to totals of securities, by 
type, held by all commercial banks. 
There is no change in the reporting requirements for 
Reports of Affiliates or in the requirements for publication 
of such reports. Detailed instructions as to information 
required and as to the circumstances for waiver of Reports of 
Affiliates are included in the new instruction booklet and 
are printed on the back of Form FR 220. 
if 
As for other recent call dates, special reports of 
loans to executive officers will be required on the same basis 
as for previous calls. No standard form has been devised for 
these reports. 
Since there apparently was some inconsistency on the part 
of member State banks in amending the headings of the publisher's 
copy of the Report of Condition to reflect the reporting status 
with respect to consolidation of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
it may be useful to remind reporting banks of the relevant 
instructions pertaining to these requirements. 
These instruc-
tions are to be found at the top of page 7 in the new instruction 
booklet. 
Reports of all insured banks will be processed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in Washington. 
Preliminary 
instructions for editing, keypunching, and preliminary processing 
of member State and national banks reports at the Reserve Banks 
were previously forwarded to the representatives of the System 
Committee for Current Reporting Series from your Bank. Additional 
instructions covering the procedure for transmission of punch 
card data and subsequent error correction messages will be 
forx^arded soon.

a d d r k i i orrioiAL c a n m i F O N D i N c t 
TO THE IQANO 
June 20, 1969. 
Mr. Howard A. Glickstein, 
Acting Staff Director, 
United States Commission on Civil Rights, 
Washington, D. C. 20425 
Dear Mr. Glickstein: 
This acknowledges your letter of May 29, 1969, wherein you 
state that part of a current study of the housing problems of min-
ority group families, particularly those with low and moderate 
income, is the impact of the policies and practices of the Board of 
Governors with respect to mortgage lending practices of State member 
banks. To aid in your evaluation, you request the Board's response 
to several questions set forth in your letter. The Board's responses, 
set forth hereafter, reflect both the Board's concurrence in the 
underlying purposes of Title VIII of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, and 
a recognition of its responsibility to enforce, with respect to State 
member banks, both the spirit and letter of this law. The following 
answers, preceded in each instance for convenient reference by the 
relevant question, have been prepared in relation to State member 
banks, as to which the Board has primary Federal supervisory, 
responsibility. 
A. 
what are the criteria used by Federal Reserve examiners in 
determining whether mortgage loan practices of member banks should be 
subject to criticism and corrective action? 
The mortgage loan practices of State member banks are 
reviewed at each examination to determine conformity 
with the provisions of applicable Federal and State 
statutes and individual loans analyzed as to credit 
quality. Examiners are instructed to inquire into 
and comment on all unsatisfactory aspects of the bank's 
policies and practices regarding real estate loar\S, 
including those pertaining to: (a) the size of both 
individual loans and the total portfolio; (b) geographic 
distribution; (c) major trends in the account; (d) re-
cent significant changes in equity requirements, repay-
ment terms, or other provisions; (e) junior liens; 

1 Mr. Howard A. Glickstein 
-2-
(f) potential other real estate; (g) methods of 
obtaining appraisals; (h) adequacy of supporting docu-
ments; (i) conformance with provisions of law; 
(f) availability of financial information where 
commercial properties are involved; (k) volume and 
severity of delinquencies; (1) weaknesses in collec-
tion procedure; and (m) adequacy of the overall 
administration of the portfolio. 
I^B. 
In view of the enactment of Title VIII of the 1968 Civil 
lights Act, with particular reference to section 805 thereof, is 
r*cial discrimination in mortgage lending among the practices subject 
t o such criticism and corrective action? 
In tny Instance where an examiner for tha System encounters 
evidence of racial discrimination in mortgage landing 
such fact would, if substantiated, be made tha subject 
of appropriate supervisory direction and action. On 
April 25, 1969, Chairman Martin addressed a letter, a 
copy of which is enclosed, to the President of each State 
member bank directing attention to the Civil Rights Act 
of 1968 and to its provisions applicable to State member 
banks that are in the business of making mortgage loans. 
A copy of the letter or instructions based on the letter 
was distributed to the System's examiners who are required 
to include in their reports information about any apparent 
violation of the Act disclosed during the course of any 
regular or special examination. 
i^iii 
In 1961, in response to a question from this Commission 
whether, in the Board's view, there are any circumstances under which 
j* member bank might properly consider the race of the would-be 
b°rrower or the racial composition of the neighborhood in determining 
whether to make a real estate loan, you replied as follows: 
"Since banks are primarily trustees of depositors' 
funds and must seek to protect those funds, it is 
entirely appropriate for them to take cognizance of 
historical patterns in real estate values. Both at 
the inception of any mortgage and during its life, a 
mortgagee must be concerned with the stability of the 
value of the underlying property and the trend of 
values in the neighborhood in which any particular 
property is located." 

2014 
1 Mr. Howard A. Glickstein 
-3-
Xn light of the enactment of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act, is 
it the Board's current view that the race of a potential borrower or 
the racial composition of a neighborhood are legitimate factors 
which member banks may be obliged to consider in determining whether 
to approve a mortgage loan application? 
Please explain. 
The Board did not in 1961, nor does it now, take the 
position that the race of a potential borrower or 
the racial composition of a neighborhood are legitimate 
factors which any lender, including member banks, may 
be permitted, much less obliged, to consider in deter-
mining approval or not of a mortgage loan application. 
To the best of our knowledge, race is not a characteristic 
affecting property values. The Board's 1961 references 
to "historical patterns in real estate values", "the 
stability of the value of the underlying property", and 
"the trend of values in the neighborhood" had relation 
solely to the economic characteristics of a neighborhood. 
The Board's position then and now with respect to racial 
characteristics as a factor in credit extensions is that 
reflected in Title VIII of the Act, namely, that the race 
of a potential borrower cannot be a decisional factor with 
respect to credit extensions. The economic character of 
a neighborhood, including the stability of the value of 
the property therein and the trend of values in the neigh-
borhood in which any particular property is located, is 
a legitimate factor for consideration by member banks in-
asmuch as it can ultimately determine the basic workout 
of a given line of credit. Within the framework of the 
foregoing considerations, one borrower seeking funds is 
entitled to the same consideration and treatment as would 
be another borrower seeking funds for the same purpose 
without consideration to race, color, creed, or sex. 
•LsJL. 
In the Board's experience, to what extent have member banks 
denied mortgage loan applications because of the race of the applicant 
the racial composition of the neighborhood in which the applicant 
was seeking to live? 
In the course of the Board's experience as the Federal 
agenc/ responsible for supervision of State member banks, 
the Board has not acquired information upon which to base 
a determination of the extent to which State member banks 
« 

1 Mr. Howard A. Glickstein 
-4-
may have denied mortgage loan applications because of 
the applicant's race or the racial composition of the 
neighborhood in which the applicant was seeking to live. 
The Board's records contain no instances of reported 
denials of credit extensions for the above-stated reasons. 
The absence of accumulated knowledge bearing on the 
reasons for which requested lines of credit may have 
been denied is, in major respects, explained by the fact 
that rarely do banks maintain files of loan application 
denials. 
UjAl 
In view of the close relationship between the Board of 
Governors and FDIC, and in view of the provisions of Title 12 of the 
United States Code regarding the consequences for member banks follow-
ing termination of FDIC insurance, we would appreciate your informing 
us whether the Board is in accord with this conclusion, [i.e., the 
conclusion of the Commission's General Counsel that the FDIC "is 
authorized to apply appropriate sanctions, including the termination 
insurance, in the event corrective action is not taken."] 
The Board believes inappropriate an expression of 
opinion on its part with respect to the conclusions 
reached by the General Counsel of the Civil Rights 
Commission as to the authority of the FDIC to apply 
sanctions, including the termination of insurance, 
in the event corrective action were not taken after 
violations of the Fair Housing Law had been the subject 
of notice to the lending institution. However, for 
purposes of responding to your inquiry, accepting the 
position taken by the Commission's General Counsel 
regarding the Corporation's authority to promulgate 
regulations relating to the antidiscriminatory lending 
practices of all insured banks, the Board and the 
Federal Reserve Banks would, within the framework of 
their supervisory responsibilities, cooperate fully in 
the enforcement of any regulations duly promulgated 
by the Corporation. 
IIJB 1 
If the Board is in accord with the conclusion of the 
c S i ^ i o n ' s General Counsel, does the Board plan to issue regulations 
relating to discrimination by member banks? 
£ L B 2 
Does the Board plan to have its examiners inquire into 
Possible discrimination by member banks? If so, by what means would 
^aminers determine whether such banks have practiced discrimination 
ln violation of Title VIII? 

2016 
1 Mr. Howard A. Glickstein

The Board does not plan to issue regulations relating 
to discrimination by State member banks (see discussion 
under III.MB). The Board believes that provisions of 
the Civil Rights Act conferring investigative and enforce-
ment authority on other Federal government agencies and 
officials should insure compliance with the letter and 
spirit of the Act. Needless to say the Board and the 
Federal Reserve Banks have and will continue within the 
framework of their supervisory responsibilities to 
cooperate fully with other agencies and officials in 
enforcement of the Act and regulations applicable to 
antidiscriminatory lending practices. As earlier stated, 
the Board has taken affirmative action to assure that its 
examiners make appropriate inquiry into possible discrim-
ination by State member banks. To this end, a copy of this 
reply to your inquiries will be sent to each Federal 
Reserve Bank for distribution to and use by members of 
their respective examination departments. The Board's 
examiners are responsible for knowledge of applicable 
provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and have a 
concurrent responsibility to take appropriate and direct 
action with respect to any violation of that law. The 
procedures described in I.B., supra, are exemplary of 
efforts undertaken to determine violations of the Act. 
j-Lj^.3. 
xn cases where discrimination has been found to have been 
Practiced and efforts to secure voluntary compliance are unsuccessful, 
the Board prepared to issue cease and desist orders, as authorized 
under the provisions of Title 12? 
In such cases, the Board is prepared to institute that 
course of regulatory action considered most likely to 
bring about an immediate, effective, and permanent 
cessation of the violation. Such actions would include 
use of appropriate provisions of the Financial Institutions 
Supervisory Act of 1966, reporting the matter to the 
U. S. Department of Justice for appropriate action, and 
referral of the instance to the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
—i^Jtiiii. 
the Board also prepared, in such cases where efforts at 
v°luntary compliance are unsuccessful, to impose additional sanctions, 
a s authorized under Title 12? If so, what additional sanctions is 
^ e Board prepared to impose? 
The Board is also prepared to impose any additional 
sanctions that are presently or may become available 
to it.

Do you believe it would be desirable to require member banks 
0 impose such [nondiscrimination] requirements on builders and 
evelopers who are financed by them as a means of assisting in carry-
out the purpose of Title VIII? 
Do you believe that the Board has sufficient existing legal 
^uthority to take such action? If not, would the Board favor the 
nactment of legislation to clarify the Board's authority in this 
re8ard? 
The Board does not favor a proposal whereby State 
member banks would be compelled to impose nondiscrimination 
requirements on builders and developers who are financed 
by such banks for the reason that, in the Board's opinion, 
a substantial question exists as to whether the Board has 
legal authority to enforce such a requirement as to State 
member banks. Moreover, the Board believes that the pre-
visions of the Act relating to the administration, enforce-
ment, and investigation authority of the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, together with the civil 
enforcement provisions of the Act, constitute effective 
remedial and enforcement avenues with respect to the Act's 
nondiscrimination provisions.

B. Please provide us, for each year from 1961 through 
1968, with information on the number and dollar amount of 
mortgage loans made by State-chartered member banks in terms 
of single-family and multi-family project mortgages. 
The information you request is not available for 
State-chartered member banks during the years cited. 
The following information on the dollar amount of net 
nonfarm residential loans acquired, covering both 
single-family and multi-family project mortgages, 
represents the closest approximation to loans made 
that can be derived from available reports. It should 
be recognized, however, that net mortgage acquisitions 
reflect not only new loan extensions but also repayments 
and retirements of old mortgages.

mortgages held by State chartered member banks. 
The information you request on number of mortgages
