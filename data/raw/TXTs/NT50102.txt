Banco del Comercio (Item No. 3). Pursuant to discussions on 
June 19 and 22, 1967, and action on the latter date, the Board granted 
consent to The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), New York, 
New York, to acquire through three subsidiaries up to 48 per cent of 
the voting shares of Banco del Comercio, Bogota, Colombia. The three 
subsidiaries comprised an Edge corporation, a wholly-owned Canadian 
subsidiary of another Edge corporation, and a new corporation, Pan 
^erican Shares Corporation, to be organized for the purpose of holding 
such shares and to be beneficially owned by Chase Manhattan Bank. The 
bank's original proposal had contemplated division of the stock acqui-
sition among four subsidiaries, the fourth being a bank premises corpo-
r ation. However, the Board denied consent with respect to that subsid-
i a r y on the ground that bank premises companies should not be used to 
Purchase foreign bank stock. 
There had now been distributed a memorandum dated June 26, 1967, 
the Division of Examinations regarding a further proposal by Chase 
^^hattan Bank to organize another subsidiary, Overseas Shares Corpora-
to substitute for the bank premises company in participating in 
acquisition of stock of Banco del Comercio. 
(The possibility of 
°
rganizirig a second new corporation to participate in the transaction 
been among the alternatives to the use of the bank premises company 
^scussed by the Board at the June 22 meeting.) 
Overseas Shares Corporation would be similar in corporate nature 
to Pan American Shares Corporation. Also, in order that the balance 

2606 
6/27/67 
-3-
sheets of Overseas Shares and Pan American Shares would show assets 
other than the shares of Banco del Comercio, and thus avoid possible 
objections under Colombian law on the ground that holding shares of 
Banco del Comercio was their sole business, Chase Manhattan requested 
aPproval of the transfer to the two new corporations of two lots of 
foreign bank stock now held by Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corpo-
r ation (the Edge corporation subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank that 
would participate in the stock acquisition). 
Stock in Privat-und 
Kommerzbank, Vienna, Austria, would be transferred to Overseas Shares, 
stock in Banco Atlantida, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, would be trans-
ferred to Pan American Shares. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft of letter that would 
grant consent to acquisition of shares of Banco del Comercio by Over-
S e a s Shares Corporation and transfer of shares of the Austrian and 
ttonduran banks to Overseas Shares and Pan American Shares, respectively. 
Governor Robertson stated that if the Board was disposed to 
aPprove the proposed acquisition and transfers of shares, he would dis-
S e n t > in accordance with the position he had taken when the Board 
aPproved the earlier request of Chase Manhattan Bank on June 22. 
After 
t g j i. 
e rating the reasons he had given for his dissent on June 22, Gover-
°
r Robertson indicated that he assumed the Board would wish to approve 
the request now before it, since it followed the pattern of conditions 
8®t n 
u t by the Board with respect to acquisition of shares of Banco 
6 1 Comercio by Pan American Shares.

In further discussion there was agreement with a change in 
wording of the draft letter relating to compliance with the guidelines 
°f the voluntary foreign credit restraint effort. 
The letter was then approved, Governor Robertson dissenting 
for the reasons he had mentioned. A copy of the letter is attached as 
Item No. 3. 
Messrs. Sammons and Poundstone then withdrew from the meeting. 
Federal Reserve note printing order (Item No. 4). 
Unanimous 
^£R£oval was given to a letter to the Comptroller of the Currency con-
fining the printing order for Federal Reserve notes for the fiscal 
year 1968. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 4. 
Proposed small business legislation (Item No. 5). There had 
keen distributed a memorandum dated June 23, 1967, from the Legal Divi-
sion regarding a request from the Chairman of the Senate Committee on 
inking and Currency for the Board's comments on a proposed amendment 
t o s« 1862, the "Small Business Act Amendments of 1967." Among other 
t h i n 8
s > the bill would increase the maximum amount that a bank may 
n vest in the stock of a small business investment company from 2 to 
p e r cent of the bank's capital and surplus. In a letter of February 15, 
1967 
* the Board had informed the Bureau of the Budget that it had no 
b a g , 
A C objection to the proposed legislation. 
:>Ht<* 
frtL. 
The amendment now proposed would provide an additional excep-
tio 
n to the limitations in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. At 

2608 
6/27/67 
-5-
present, under section 23A no member bank, with certain exceptions, is 
Permitted to extend any credit to its affiliate, invest in the capital 
stock, bonds, or other such obligations of its affiliate, or accept the 
capital stock, bonds, or other such obligations of any affiliate as 
collateral for advances to any person or organization, if the total 
°f all such transactions relating to one affiliate exceeds 10 per cent 
°f the member bank's capital and surplus or if the total relating to 
m°re than one affiliate exceeds 20 per cent of the member bank's capi-
tal and surplus. In addition, section 23A requires that any extension 
credit by a member bank to an affiliate be secured by collateral 
securities equal in value to at least 120 per cent of the amount of 
the credit, with exceptions for collateral of certain types, such as 
Government obligations. 
The proposed amendment would limit loans by a member bank to 
affii 
iated small business investment company to 5 per cent of the 
b a n k ' s capital and surplus. In this respect it would be more restric-
tive than the present terms of the statute. However, the amendment 
w°uld relieve member banks of the collateral requirements and of the 
^-iniitation on the aggregate of loans to more than one affiliated small 
k^slness investment company. 
The memorandum mentioned various considerations for and against 
proposed amendment, and to it was attached a draft of reply to 
^
a i r m a n Sparkman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee that 
w°uld state that the Board had no objection to the proposal. 

2609

In introductory comments Mr. Cardon said that according to his 
understanding, the proposed amendment, which had been recommended by 
the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies, was 
designed to improve the ability of banks that had small business invest 
ment company affiliates to assist those companies according to their 
fluctuating needs. To that end, it was proposed that, in addition to 
the increase from 2 to 5 per cent of a bank's capital and surplus that 
could be invested in such companies, the bank also be allowed to make 
loans to any one such affiliate equal to an additional 5 per cent of 
C apital and surplus, without the collateral requirements and the limit 
°
n aggregate loans to or investments in all affiliates of a bank. Tech 
^ically, at least, the proposed legislation would appear to permit a 
hank to have several affiliated small business investment companies, 
•ut it was Mr. Cardon's impression that no bank was in that position, 
a conversation he had had with Mr. Solomon (Examinations) the latter 
leaned in the direction of applying the 5 per cent limit to the 
a8gr e gate of loans by a bank to all its affiliated small business 
Investment companies, in order to cover the possibility that at some 
^
uture time a bank might have more than one. The Board might wish to 
c°nsider suggesting a revision of the proposed amendment along those 
Unes. 
Governor Robertson noted that for practical purposes multiple 
f i l i a t i o n s of small business investment companies were now to be 

261.0 
6/27/67 
-7-
found in holding company systems in which several of the component 
banks had such affiliates. He believed this situation lent emphasis 
to Mr. Solomon's misgivings, as reported by Mr. Cardon. Moreover, 
while Governor Robertson would have no objection to providing greater 
latitude for banks to make loans to their small business investment 
company affiliates, he believed that removing the aggregate limitations 
now in the law was the wrong approach. He then suggested a revision 
»• £ jL(l 
°f the proposed amendment that would relieve banks of the collateral 
requirements now in section 23A (but only with respect to loans to 
companies of which the bank owned a majority of the stock), but which 
Would retain the aggregate limitations with respect to equity invest-
m e*ts and loans combined. 
Discussion indicated agreement by the other members of the 
^°ard with the approach recommended by Governor Robertson, and various 
S uSgestions were made regarding the terms in which the Board's view 
should be conveyed to the Committee. 
I 
At the conclusion of the discussion unanimous approval was 
§iven to the sending to Chairman Sparkman of a letter in the form 
' j J •.» 
a ttached as Item No. 5. It was also understood that a copy of the 
^
e tter would be sent to the Small Business Administration, which, Mr. 
^
a rdon indicated, had asked to be informed of the position taken by 
t h e Board.

Loans to employees for stock purchases (Item No. 6). There had 
been distributed a memorandum dated June 26, 1967, from the Legal Divi-
sion regarding a request by Marshall & Ilsley Bank Stock Corporation, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for an interpretation by the Board with respect 
t o the applicability of the Bank Holding Company Act to a proposal 
involving loans by the Corporation's subsidiary banks. The plan con-
templated that a subsidiary bank would lend up to $500 to each quali-
fied employee of the lending bank; the loan would be used to purchase 
shares of Marshall & Ilsley stock for the benefit of the employee; and 
the shares purchased would be registered in the employee's name but 
would be retained by the lending bank to secure repayment of the loan. 
Inasmuch as only a general question had been presented to the 
without specific details of the entire plan, it was not possible 
t o determine at this time whether any statutory violations would be 
Involved. Therefore, the draft reply attached to the memorandum fol-
d e d the general approach of calling attention to various statutes 
Board regulations that might affect the proposal. However, the 
letter would state that the plan outlined appeared not to fall 
ithin the prohibition in section 5201 of the Revised Statutes against 
by a member bank on the security of shares of its own capital 
stock. 
Governor Robertson questioned whether the reply should take a 
n o n regarding the applicability of the prohibition in section 5201 

V 2 7 / 6 7 
-9-
when no conclusions were drawn regarding the applicability of other 
statutes and regulations. He was reluctant to take a position on any 
Point in the absence of having all the facts. 
Staff responses brought out that the primary fact relevant to 
the section 5201 prohibition had been furnished. 
That section prohibits 
loans by a member bank on the security of its own stock, whereas the 
collateral for the loans in the plan outlined by Marshall & Ilsley was 
Lr»e stock of the holding 
company. While it was conceivable that a bank 
m ight evade that prohibition by setting up a shell bank holding company 
m erely to hold the bank's stock, and then make loans secured by the 
s tock of the holding company, there was available a clear-cut court 
^
ecision that if a holding company was a bona fide separate corporate 
entity } the use of its stock as security for a loan by one of its 
subsidiary banks did not constitute a violation of section 5201. 
Governor Brimmer expressed reluctance to have the Board take 
Position regarding a situation about which so little was known of 
the 
e detailed facts. 
It seemed to him it would be more prudent to ask 
^
a rshall & Ilsley to furnish complete information if they wanted the 
°
ard to express a view . He would not object to sending Marshall & 
Ilsl 
°
tey the staff views for their guidance, but he believed it would 
b e 
u 
nwise to take an official position on the basis of information 
M a i l a b l e . 
tio 
Governor Daane also expressed a preference for obtaining addi-
information before giving a Board interpretation.

Iri further discussion it was suggested that the letter to 
Marshall & Ilsley cite the various statutes and regulations that might 
be applicable, note that the comments were those of the Board's Legal 
Division, and state that if a ruling by the Board was desired, full 
details regarding the loan plan should be furnished. There was agree-
ment with that suggestion. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the sending of a letter 
in the form attached as Item No. 6. 
Messrs. Cardon, Hexter, Noble, and Lyon, Mrs. Heller, and Miss 
^eene then withdrew from the meeting. 
Waiver of reserve deficiency penalties (Item No. 7). In a 
l etter of June 14, 1967, First Vice President Helmer of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago expressed concern that the Board's letter of 
^ n e 8, 1967, regarding delegation of certain functions to the Reserve 
^
anks, had not set specific standards for the guidance of Reserve Banks 
waiving penalties for reserve deficiencies of member banks. It was 
a ssumed that the Board had not intended to tighten the standards pre-
viously contained in F.R.L.S. #6120, but the Reserve Bank requested a 
s t atement from the Board as to whether or not the Bank should continue 
tn U s e similar standards. Among other things, F.R.L.S. #6120 had given 
a u thority to the Reserve Banks to waive the penalty for any deficiency 
of o 
Per cent or less if offset by excess reserves in the following 
e serve computation period. 

2614 
6/27/67 
-11-
There had been distributed a draft of reply to Mr. Helmer that 
would, in essence, state that it had been the intent to leave the 
latter to the judgment of the Reserve Banks, the key consideration 
being whether any particular deficiency arose from misconduct on the 
Part of the member bank. 
Governor Daane called attention to the last paragraph of the 
draft reply, which referred to the agreement reached during the recent 
m eeting of the Conference of Presidents that if any Reserve Bank 
decides not to follow any of the Board rules previously in effect 
under F.R.L.S. #6120, it will so advise the other Reserve Banks. The 
d r a f t then stated that "Although there is no objection to such a pro-
c u r e , the Board does not consider that uniformity among the Reserve 
u«mc s in granting waivers of penalties for deficient reserves should 
1)6 a major concern." 
It seemed to Governor Daane that it would not be 
d e sirable to imply that the Board was not interested in uniformity of 
t r eatment of requests for waivers. 
Mr. Sanders commented that it had been the understanding of 
n e Legal Division that the Board intended that the Reserve Banks 
waive penalties according to their judgment of the particular 
Cumstances of each deficiency, and that it had been recognized that 
here could be variations of judgment among Reserve Banks. For example 
0 u g h the Board's former instructions had allowed the Reserve Banks 
W aive penalties in amounts up to $5, the Federal Reserve Bank of 

2615 
6/27/67 
-12-
Minneapolis had indicated that under the new delegation of authority 
it would waive penalties of up to $25, in the absence of controversial 
circumstances, on the ground that that amount was minimal. 
If the 
Legal Division had been mistaken in its impression of the Board's intent 
and uniformity was desired, that could, of course, be specified. 
Governor Daane had no objection to the waiver of penalties of 
up 
to $25 by the Minneapolis Bank or any other Reserve Bank, and he 
did not believe the Board should attempt to administer minor details. 
His concern was that the Board should not appear to be indifferent to 
the principle of reasonable uniformity. 
Governor Brimmer thought the intention was to delegate this 
function, leaving its exercise to the judgment of the Reserve Banks. 
If the Board intended to set a guideline, that guideline should be 
changed from time to time as considered necessary. 
Mr. Brill observed that current studies of reserve proposals 
ky System committees had developed a recommendation, which had already 
b e e n approved by several System working groups, that there be an auto-
m a t i c carry-forward of either deficiencies or excess reserves of up to 
2 
Per cent. 
If the Board should ultimately approve such a recommenda-
tion, it would thereby in effect establish a somewhat uniform procedure, 
^ith that possibility in prospect, it would seem inconsistent to say 
*t thi s point that uniformity was not an objective of the Board. 
Governor Robertson remarked that the delegation of authority 
not been intended to provide license for a hodgepodge of inequities. 

2 6 1 6 
6/27/67 
-13-
The purpose had been to speed up processing of relatively minor matters, 
and general guidelines had been set up. He believed the action of the 
Presidents in arranging for a Reserve Bank to advise others of depar-
tures from the guidelines of the Board's previous authorization in 
P*
R.L.S. #6120 was a helpful step, and it would be well for the Board 
t o give weight to their attitude. He then suggested a revision of the 
language of the last sentence of the letter to avoid the impression 
that the Board was disinterested in uniformity. 
During further discussion it was understood that the reply to 
Helmer would be revised in the light of the views that had been 
e xPressed, and the Board approved unanimously the sending of a letter 
t o the Federal Reserve Banks that would incorporate the substance of 
t t l e letter to Mr. Helmer. A copy of the letter sent to the Federal 
Reserve Bank Presidents pursuant to this action is attached as 
All members of the staff except Mr. Sherman then withdrew. 
Administrative matters. Governor Robertson then reported to 
Board on several matters relating to internal management of the 
Board • o 
b organization. This included reference to a revised form of 
S e voucher requesting reimbursement when "actual expense" travel 
a uthorized, and improvements in automobile and chauffeur service 
a rrangements for making available additional telephone service. 
He 
0 reported on discussions that he had held with some of the 
Members regarding the supervisory responsibility for messengers 

2 6 1 7 
6/27/67 
-14-
servicing the Board Members' Offices, stating that he would wish to 
talk with the other members of the Board before making any changes in 
the present arrangements. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Appointment of Mr. Yager (Secretary's Note). At the meeting 
May 11, 1967, the Board approved the recommendation of Governor 
Robertson that Messrs. Brill and Robert Solomon be authorized to nego-
tiate with Charles A. Yager with a view to obtaining his services, upon 
^is return from assignment as Director of the National Accounts and 
Statistics Branch of the OECD in Paris, as an Associate Adviser in 
either the Division of Research and Statistics or the Division of Inter-
n ational Finance at a salary of $22,500 per annum. In authorizing such 
ne8°tiations, it was understood that if Mr. Yager accepted appointment 
a s Associate Adviser in the Division of International Finance, adjust-
,ut:nts also would be made in the salaries of Reed J. Irvine and Ralph C. 
Advisers in that Division, to bring them to the rate of $22,500 
Per n 
annum, effective at the time of Mr. Yager's entrance upon duty. 
In a memorandum dated June 22, 1967, Mr. Solomon advised the 
a r d that Mr. Yager had accepted the position of Associate Adviser in 
sion of International Finance, with salary at the rate of 
i > • . . , 
$22 
>500 per annum, effective the date of entrance upon duty, expected 
0 be about August 15, 1967. 
Accordingly, on June 26, 1967, Governor Robertson approved on 
behaic 
i r of the Board adjustments in the salaries of Messrs. Irvine and 

2618 
6/27/67 
-15-
Wood to bring them to the rate of $22,500 per annum, effective the same 
date that Mr. Yager assumes his duties as Associate Adviser in that 
Divis ion.

Statutory considerations. - Section 3(c) of the Act provides 
^at the Board shall not approve an acquisition that would result in a 
tn°nopolyj or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy 
t o monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. 
Nor may the Board approve a proposed acquisition, the effect of which, 
^
 
a n y section of the country, may be substantially to lessen competition, 
or tenH 
ua to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in 
a i n t of trade, unless the Board finds that the anticompetitive effects 
of t. e Proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest 
by 
e Probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and 
°f the community to be served. In each case the Board is required 
tal 
into consideration the financial and managerial resources and 
fut U r e 
prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, and 
c°nvenience and needs of the community to be served. 
Competitive effect of proposed transaction. - There are nine 
*g or 
* M c h 
ka&kt 
organizations (including five bank holding companies) in Virginia 
have deposits in excess of $100 million; these organizations, in the 
a ^ t e g a t 
account for about 62 per cent of the deposits and 51 per cent 
" ^ e offJ 
J-cices of all commercial banks in the State. Applicant is the 
f°
Utth l a 
argest of these organizations and the second largest holding company 
^ n t s for about 6 per cent of the total deposits and about 7 per 
o f 
t. 
v n e commercial banking offices in the State. Its relative position 
V d 
r e 
main unchanged by the proposed acquisition, its share of deposits 
Or t 
n l ;ing offices being increased, respectively, by .1 per cent and 
c 
cent. 

-3-
2 6 2 4 
The designated primary service area of Bank's four offices 
^he area from which Applicant estimates Bank derives about 90 per cent 
its deposits of individuals, partnerships, and corporations ("IPC deposits' 
i s an area of Northern Virginia which encompasses the City of Falls Church 
atld P o t i o n s of Arlington and Fairfax Counties and the City of Alexandria. 
The 
Population of the area is estimated to be about 198,000, which represents 
a n increase of 50,000 since 1960. Based on total deposits, Bank is the 
Vilest of the 14 banks operating in the primary service area. 
Applicant's subsidiaries have no offices within the primary 
l c e area of Bank. Although the seven largest banks operating in the 
area a r ® controlled by three other bank holding companies, the proposed 
^ • l e i o n would not significantly increase holding company concentration, 
arid applicant' s share of area deposits would be the smallest of the four 
^Idi 
n 8 companies operating in the area. Applicant's only subsidiary with 
Qffj 
C e s in Northern Virginia (which includes Arlington and Fairfax Counties 
4rid th 
n e Cities of Alexandria, Falls Church, and Fairfax) is The Bank of 
P r l 
C e W i l U a m . which has four offices in Northern Virginia, all of which 
lo 
cated from four to nine miles from the nearest office of Bank. 
The 
°niy b usiness derived by Bank from the service area of these offices is 
*
U A y attributable directly or indirectly to directors of Bank who 
^ i d e i 
l n and have business interests in such area. Additionally, Applicant 
that none of the offices of its nuboidiory banks holdc IPC denocit;: or 
I o*
ns w"ich originated within the primary service area of any of Bank's 
^ ^ r r -
n°t include a recently chartered bank not yet open for business. 

-4- 
2 6 2 S 
°ffices. In any case, the effect of the transaction in this broader 
Northern Virginia area would be to increase Applicant's share of the area 
d ePosits only slightly, and such share would still be less than 2 per cent. 
^
V en without making allowance for the competitive influence exerted by 
C cmmercial banks in the District of Columbia and in Maryland suburbs, it 
apparent that the proposal's effect on existing competition or concen-
tration is not a significant consideration. 
The potential for future competition among Bank, Applicant's 
S U ^
s ^ i a r i e s , and other Northern Virginia banks must be viewed in the light 
^ the difficulties presently faced by Bank and discussed hereafter, which 
Board views as seriously limiting both Bank's actual and potential com-
P e t itive ability. 
In view of this limited potential of Bank under its 
Pto 
S ent ownership, the possibility of its unassisted development into a 
lit °
nS competitor is so remote as to present no obstacle to approval of the 
'''Plication. 
Summarizing the effect of the proposed acquisition on competition, 
the B 
°ard concludes that consummation would not result in a monopoly nor 
b e in f 
^rtherancc of any combination, conspiracy, or attempt to monopolize 
^
usiness of banking. There is no probability that the acquisition may 
<-ne effect of substantially lessening actual or potential competition 
of 
it 
M l any 
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. - The 
cial history and condition of Applicant arc satisfactory and its 
of 
tending to create a monopoly in any section of the country, nor would 
any other manner be in restraint of trade. 

fei^

i : 
Prospects are considered favorable. Deposits of constituent banks continue 
t o trend upward and earnings are good. Its lead bank has a comprehensive 
Gaining program and has developed a reservoir of managerial talent. The 
s°utid condition and general quality of operations of the subsidiary banks 
teflect the satisfactory quality of their management and the close and 
e f fective administrative control exercised by senior officials of Applicant. 
Substantial loan losses incurred by Bank have contributed to a 
earnings record and have resulted in impairment of its surplus account 
arid a *. u 
ctireat to its capital position. This experience is in large part 
fitt>< U 
Mutable to a lack of depth of experienced management. Of Bank's 
0 riginal directors, only five are presently on its board. None of the 
e s c n t directors of Ban!: is experienced in banking matters. Bank's President, 
Vh<> hn 5 i been associated with it only since March 1965, appears to be 
^Hpgy. J 
fenced and able, but has been unable to effect substantial improvement 
h thG 
operations of Bank because of a lack of strong director support and 
* Uck nf 
" °t management depth. Absent substantial and immediate improvement 
th 
e foregoing respects, Bank s prospects cannot be regarded as favorable. 
Affiliation with Applicant will provide Bank with access to 
fcent training facilities as well as to an available pool of manage-
trainces. The knowledge and experience of officers of Applicant and 
S u bsidiary banks in credit analysis, operations, and other areas will 
immediately available to Bank and xjill permit the initiation and 
out of steps necessary to overcome the problems presently facing 
^ 
and 
a offer reasonable assurance of substantial improvement in its 

'I'M 
-6-

W
m 
Prospects. The foregoing considerations lend considerable weight toward 
i 
aPproval of the application. 
Convenience and needs of the community involved. - The proposed 
transaction will not make available to the community any services not 
. 
Presently available to it. Correction of the problems discussed under the 
°anUitig factors, however, will substantially improve Bank's ability to serve 
community. In addition to a general improvement in Bank's effectiveness 
a s a lender to the community, affiliation would make loan participations 
^ith members of Applicant's system more readily and conveniently available. 
nsiderations of the community convenience and needs lend additional weight 
"
ard approval of the application. 
Summary and conclusion. - On the basis of all relevant facts 
c°
ntained in the record, it is the Board's judgment that the proposed 
J;. 
faction would be in the public interest and that the application should 
e aPproved

The Honorable John Sparkman, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
United States Senate, 
Washington, D. C. 
20510 
D e a r Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your letter of June 15, 1967, 
r equesting the comments of the Board on a proposed amendment to 
S* 1862, the "Small Business Act Amendments of 1967." 
The 
Proposed amendment would exempt from section 23A of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c) loans by member banks to affiliated 
S mall business investment companies. 
The Board believes that the considerations that support 
a n increase in the limits on investment by member banks in shares 
small business investment companies (as provided in the bill) 
so warrant an amendment to section 23A to enable member banks 
m°
re readily to make loans to their subsidiary SBIC's. 
In our 
judgment, however, this objective can be accomplished with a 
w
e s s sweeping amendment than that on which you asked for comment. 
.
e believe that the first paragraph of section 23A, which limits 
Q^
vestments by a member bank in any one affiliate to 10 per cent 
the bank's capital and surplus, and limits investments in all 
tillates to 20 per cent of its capital and surplus, should 
^
n t i n u e to apply to investments in affiliated SBIC's. 
Since 
e s e limits apply both to equity investments and to loans, this 
0 
^ mean that a member bank that invested 5 per cent of its 
Pital and surplus in the shares of a subsidiary SBIC could 
s ° make loans to the SBIC up to an additional 5 per cent. 
If 
G stock investment were smaller the loan limit would be 
c
r°
p°rtionately larger, but always less than 10 per cent. 
The 
lateral requirements of the second paragraph of section 23A 
a 
be waived, but only where the affiliation between the bank 
SBt
 
S B I C results from bank ownership of a majority of the 
ame
 
S V o t l n 8 shares. Accordingly, we suggest that the proposed 
e r idment be revised to read as follows: 

The Honorable John Sparkman 
-2-
"(d) The third paragraph of section 23A of the 
Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c) is hereby amended 
by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: 
The provisions of the second paragraph of this section 
shall not apply to loans to a small business investment 
company licensed under the Small Business Investment Act 
ot 
8 where the lending bank owns a majority of the 
voting shares of such company.

Mr. F. R. Steinmann, 
Secretary, 
Marshall & lis ley Bank Stock Corporation, 
721 North Water Street, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
53202 
Dear Mr. Steinmann: 
This refers to your letter of May 19, 1967, in which you 
ask for an interpretation by the Board with respect to the applica-
bility of the Bank Holding Company Act to a proposal regarding loans 
by banks that are subsidiaries of the Marshall & lis ley Bank Stock 
Corporation ("M&I Corp."), such loans to be used to purchase stock 
of the parent holding company for the benefit of the lending bank's 
employees and to be secured by said stock. You state that a subsidiary 
bank would lend up to $500 to a qualified employee to purchase stock 
of the parent holding company, and that the shares thus purchased 
would be registered in the name of the employee and would be held by 
the lending bank until repayment of the loan. 
Public Law 89-485 (80 Stat. 236), enacted in 1966, and 
entitled "An Act to Amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956", in 
addition to providing amendments to the 1956 Act, contains various 
Provisions that affect bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
by virtue of certain amendments to other statutes, some of which have 
a bearing on the proposal you are considering. Your attention is 
directed, particularly, to the amended provisions of section 23A of 
the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c) and of section 18 of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (18 U.S.C. 1828). 
Under section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, the term 
"affiliate" includes bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. 
Under section 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the provisions 
of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act relating to loans and other 
dealings between member banks and their affiliates are applicable to 
nonmember insured banks as if such banks were member banks. On the 
basis of these statutory provisions, M&I Corp. and all its subsidiary 
banks are subject to the provisions of section 23A of the Federal 
Reserve Act. Paragraph 1 of section 23A makes it unlawful for any 
bank in the M&I Corp. system to accept the capital stock of M&I Corp.

as collateral security for a loan to any person if the aggregate amount 
of (1) said bank's loans and other extensions of credit to M&I Corp., 
(2) investments in stock or obligations of M&I Corp., and (3) advances 
against "M&I related collateral" will exceed 10 per cent of the capital 
stock and surplus of any such bank; or if the aggregate amount of said 
bank's loans and other extensions of credit to all its affiliates, 
investments in stock or obligations of such affiliates, and advances 
against the collateral security of such affiliates will exceed 20 per 
cent of the capital stock and surplus of such bank. On the basis of 
the facts submitted, it is not possible to determine whether the aggregate 
amount of the items involved would be within the permissible limits of 
section 23A. 
If the proposal you contemplate should result in a pledgee bank 
directly or indirectly owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, 
25 per cent or more of the voting shares of M&I Corp., such acquisition 
would confer bank holding company status on the pledgee bank and would 
be unlawful under the Holding Company Act without prior approval of the 
Board. 
In this connection, you may wish to refer to the Board's instruc-
tions with respect to the terms "control" and "holding with power to 
v°te" as set forth in Instruction No. 2 of the Board's form FR Y-6 
(Annual Report). A copy of said form is enclosed for your convenience. 
In addition to the above limitations relating to the activities 
°f holding companies and their subsidiaries, you may wish to bear in 
mind the Board's Regulation U and the provisions of section 7 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C, 78g) providing certain 
limitations on bank loans made for the purpose of purchasing securities. 
Further, as recognized in your letter, loans to executive officers of 
member banks would be subject to the limitations of the Board's Regula-
tion 0 and of section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Your attention is directed also to the provisions of section 
5201 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 83) and section 9 of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C 324), under which a member bank is not permitted 
to make a loan on the security of the shares of its own capital stock. 
Although such prohibition may be deemed, in some circumstances, to apply 
to a loan by a subsidiary bank on the security of shares of its parent 
company, the plan you outline appears not to fall within said prohibition 
section 5201.

If a ruling by the Board is

to those facts that are relevant in the light of the above-mentioned 
statutory and regulatory provisions.

June 28, 1967. 
Dear Sir: 
Quoted below is the text of a letter sent to a Federal 
Reserve Bank under date of June 27, 1967, in response to an inquiry 
a s to whether the Board's letter of June 8, 1967 (S-2020) was intended 
t o tighten the standards for waiving penalties for deficient reserves, 
as compared with those set forth in Federal Reserve Loose-Leaf 
Service #6120: 
As indicated in Item (e)(6) of Attachment B to S-2020 
of June 8, 1967, the Reserve Banks are authorized "To waive 
the penalty for deficient reserves by a member bank if, 
after a review of all the circumstances relating to such 
deficiency, the Reserve Bank concludes that waiver of the 
penalty is warranted, except that in no case shall a 
penalty for deficient reserves be waived if the deficiency 
arises out of the bank's gross negligence or conduct 
inconsistent with the principles and purposes of reserve 
requirements. 
You are correct in assuming that in adopting this 
authorization the Board did not intend to tighten the 
standards for waiving penalties for deficient reserves. 
Thus, although Federal Reserve Loose-Leaf Service #6120 
was superseded by the new authorization, your Bank may 
continue to waive a penalty for a deficiency of 2 per cent 
or less if such deficiency is offset by excess reserves in 
the following period. 
It is believed that, in view of the 
Board's previous indications with respect to waivers, the 
deficiency in such circumstances would ordinarily not be 
considered as arising out of the member bank's gross 
negligence or conduct inconsistent with the principles 
and purposes of reserve requirements. 

- 2 -
S-2022 
In acting under the new authorization, your Bank 
might consider it appropriate in certain circumstances 
to waive a penalty for a deficiency of more than 2 per 
cent if such deficiency is offset by excess reserves in 
the following period. Before doing so, however, it is 
expected that your Bank will have determined that the 
deficiency did not arise out of the member bank's gross 
negligence or conduct inconsistent with the principles 
and purposes of reserve requirements. In this connection, 
it is believed that a recurring deficiency of more than 
2 per cent would be indicative of conduct inconsistent 
with the principles and purposes of reserve requirements 
and would probably arise from gross negligence--that is, 
willful disregard of reserve requirements--on the part of 
the member bank. 
Your question with respect to whether your Bank should 
continue to use standards similar to those formerly 
contained in F.R.L.S. #6120 is a matter for your Bank's 
judgment. Removal from the current authorization of any 
specific examples of situations in which a waiver may be 
appropriately granted reflects the view that, because the 
essential question to consider in granting a waiver is 
whether the deficiency arises out of misconduct on the 
part of the member bank, the Board should attempt to refrain 
from outlining specific types of situations in which a 
delegee may grant a waiver. 
It should be pointed out that increasing the authority 
of the Reserve Banks in this area was not intended to 
encourage the granting of waivers or, more basically, to 
encourage member banks to conduct their operations with 
the expectation that, in the event of a deficiency, the 
penalty would be waived. Thus, although it does not appear 
essential at this time to revise the provisions of your 
circular relating to waivers, you may wish to review them 
in the light of the new authorization and this consideration. 
By now you are probably aware that at their recent 
Conference, the Presidents agreed that before a Reserve 
Bank decides not to follow any of the Board rules previously 
in effect under F.R.L.S. #6120, it will so advise the 

2640

S-2d22 
other Reserve Banks. Such a procedure should be helpful 
in leading toward a desirable degree of uniformity among 
the Reserve Banks in granting waivers of penalties for 
deficient reserves. 
Very truly yours, 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.

FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS,

The Honorable Wright Patman, Chairman, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D. C. 
20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This is in response to your letter of March 3, 1967, 
requesting a report on H.R. 6428, a bill to eliminate the require-
ment that the Federal Reserve banks maintain gold certificate 
reserves against Federal Reserve notes in circulation. 
Continued growth in the volume of Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation will necessitate a change in the gold certificate 
reserve requirement in the near future. Enactment of H.R. 6428 
would free the United States' gold stock for use as an inter-
national monetary reserve--the principal function performed by 
gold today--and, in conjunction with continued strong efforts 
to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in United States' inter-
national transactions, would strengthen the international position 
of the dollar. 
Accordingly, the Board favors enactment of H.R. 6428. 
Sincerely yours
