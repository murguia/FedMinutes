securities market, including prospective Treasury financing, Mr. Fry 
^viewed bank credit projections, and Mr. Baker discussed developments 
the gold and foreign exchange markets against the background of the 
Middle East crisis. Copies of the several charts and tables distributed

Withdrawal of time deposits. Governor Robertson and Mr. Solomon 
(Adviser) referred to a question that had arisen in connection with 
iW-i • 

• 6/9/67 
-2-
certain actual or prospective requests by foreign depositors to with-
draw time deposits in U.S. commercial banks before maturity. The prob-
lem related to the provisions of Regulation Q (Payment of Interest on 
Deposits) prescribing conditions on which such deposits may be withdrawn 
before maturity. The New York Reserve Bank was anxious that the Regu-
lation Q provisions be recognized as routine requirements of long stand-
ing and not regarded as an indication of an attempt to block foreign 
accounts. Accordingly, language had been suggested for the use of the 
commercial banks in advising any interested foreign depositors of the 
Regulation Q requirements. Mr. Solomon then read the language that was 
being suggested.

Approved items. The following letters were approved unanimously 
after consideration of background information that had been made avail-
able to the members of the Board. Copies are attached under the respec-
tive item numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to City Trust Company, Bridgeport, 
1 
Connecticut, approving the establishment 
of a branch in Milford. 
Letter to The Connecticut Bank and Trust 
2 
Company, Hartford, Connecticut, approving 
the establishment of a branch in Middletown. 
Letter to Senator Proxmire, Chairman of the 
3 
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the 
Committee on Banking and Currency, replying 
to his request for information on steps being 
taken by the Federal bank supervisory agencies 
and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to coor-
dinate their regulatory policies and procedures 
and to improve their examination methods. 
Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Phila- 
4 
delphia approving the payment of salaries to 
seven officers at rates fixed by the Bank's 
Board of Directors. 
Maturity distribution of bank holdings of State and local 
obligations. In a memorandum dated June 7, 1967, Messrs. Eckert and 
Veenstra recommended that the Bureau of the Budget be requested to 
aPprove a reporting form to collect information on the maturity dis-
tribution of State and local government obligations held by State 
Member banks. This would be a supplement to the June 1967 report of 
condition. The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit 

-4-
Insurance Corporation had agreed to use the same form to collect such 
information from national banks and insured nonmember banks. The pro-
posal reflected a recommendation of the System Research Advisory Com-
mittee that a census of State and local security holdings by banks be 
undertaken preparatory to the possible introduction of a periodic survey 
covering larger banks in the weekly reporting bank series. Comparable 
data were last collected with the June 1956 reports of condition. 
The proposal was approved unanimously. 
Report on banking in Arizona (Item No. 5). In a memorandum 
dated June 7, 1967, Mr. Hackley related that the Federal Reserve Bank 
°f San Francisco had received a request from Valley National Bank, 
Phoenix, Arizona, for a copy of a report made by the Reserve Bank to 
the Board of Governors in November 1956 entitled "Investigation of 
Banking in Arizona." It appeared that an officer of Valley National 
had been asked to comment on a monograph prepared by a professor at an 
Arizona college and that the monograph contained excerpts from the report 
iicc 
; .; 
in question, the author apparently having obtained access to a copy of 
.<> 
the report at the library of the University of Oregon. 
When the Reserve Bank s report was submitted, the Board decided 
'.I •..>..; 
n°t to furnish copies to the Arizona banks involved, but a copy was 
Sent to the Department of Justice. In April 1960 the Board concluded 
that none of the transactions covered by the report violated the Clayton 
Act, and the Justice Department was so advised. In 1962 the Department 

23i '8 
I, 
6/9/67 
-5-
instituted antitrust proceedings against the Valley National group, 
and in 1966 the proceedings terminated in a consent decree under which 
Valley National agreed not to acquire any additional banks for 15 years 
and Arizona Bank (controlled by Valley National) agreed to refrain from 
mergers for five years. It was also agreed that Valley National's 
Profit-sharing fund would dispose of its holdings in Arizona Bancorpo-
ration within three years. 
After discussion, it was understood that the San Francisco 
Reserve Bank would be informed that the Board had no obiection to the 
u 
Reserve Bank's complying with the request of Valley National Bank for 
a copy of the 1956 report. A copy of the letter sent to the Reserve 
Bank is attached as Item No. 5. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Note: Governor Robertson 
today approved on behalf of the Board 
the following items: 
Letter over the signature of Governor Maisel to Professor Donald R. 
Hodgman of the University of Illinois requesting that he prepare a paper 
examining the theory and some of the problems that might arise if some 
°f the selective controls utilized by the central banks of other coun-
tries were applied in the United States during a period of limited war 
m°bilization, with the understanding that the Board would pay an hono-
rarium of $3,000 for the project, along with travel expenses in accor-
dance with the Board's travel regulations for occasional trips by 
Professor Hodgman to Washington for consultation purposes. 
(This action 
authorized any resulting overexpenditure in the pertinent account of the 
i967 budget of the Division of Research and Statistics.)

The Honorable William Proxmire, Chairman, 
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, 
Committee on Banking and Currency, 
United States Senate, 
Washington, D. C. 20510. 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
In your letter of February 23, 1967, to Chairman Martin, 
you mentioned the statement of the President in his Economic Report in 
which he urges the Federal bank supervisory agencies and the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board "to continue and to intensify their efforts to 
coordinate their regulatory policies and procedures, and to improve 
their examination methods". You request our comments with respect to 
fche President's recommendations. 
At this time relations between the agencies are good and 
a high degree of cooperation exists. Of primary importance in main-
lining cooperation is the Coordinating Committee on Bank Regulation 
c°nsisting of Comptroller of the Currency Camp, Chairman Randall of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chairman Home of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and me. At the bi-weekly meetings 
matters of mutual interest are discussed with the express intention 
°f arriving at positions which will result in greater coordination of 
Regulatory policies and procedures and improved examination methods. 
Moreover, a subcommittee of staff members meets frequently to discuss 
Matters of common interest and to attempt to agree on common positions 
°r approaches to problems.

The Honorable William Proxmire

As indicated in the enclosed list, which is merely 
illustrative, there are numerous areas in which cooperation has 
been strengthened with resultant improvement of examination pro-
cedures. I can assure you that efforts looking toward even greater 
cooperation and coordination and to the improvement of examination 
methods will continue. 
Sincerely, 
(Signed) J. L. Robertson

Mr. Eliot J. Swan, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 
San Francisco, California 94120. 
Dear Mr. Swan: 
With reference to our telephone conversation regarding 
the report made by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to 
the Board of Governors in November 1956 entitled "Investigation 
of Banking in Arizona," the Board has considered the question 
whether a copy can now be made available to Valley National Bank, 
Phoenix, Arizona, in response to an inquiry received from an 
officer of that Bank. 
Technically, the report constitutes "unpublished 
information of the Board." However, it has apparently already 
keen made available to the public, even though without the Board's 
consent, at the University of Oregon. The Board's consideration of 
the matter on the basis of the report was concluded in 1960; and 
the legal situation under the antitrust laws appears to have been 
settled by the consent decree obtained by the Department of Justice 
in 1966. 
Accordingly, the Board has concluded that there is no 
sound reason why a copy of the report should not now be made 
Mailable to the Valley National Bank or to others who may request 
an opportunity to see it. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
