available to the Board. Copies are attached under the respective 
numbers indicated. 
Item No. 
Letter to First Chicago International Finance

Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, granting con-
sent to the acquisition of shares of Mid-
America International Development Association, 
Inc., a Liberian corporation. 
Letter to Chemical International Banking Cor- 
2 
poration, New York, New York, granting consent 
to the acquisition of shares of Banco Inter-
nacional del Peru, Lima, Peru. 
Letter to Chairman Patman of the House Banking 
3 
and Currency Committee in reply to his request 
for cooperation with the Comptroller General 
in the latter's investigation, on behalf of 
the Committee, into policies, methods, and 
procedures followed in connection with public 
offerings of U.S. obligations. 
Letter to Girard Trust Bank, Philadelphia, 
4 
Pennsylvania, relating to its request for cer-
tain. information developed by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia pertaining to 
the proposed merger of The Doylestown National 
Bank into Girard Trust. 
In connection with Item No. 3, Mr. Holland indicated that 
although Chairman Patman1s request was couched in general terms it was 
understood that specific reference had been made in the instruction to 
the Comptroller General to the leak last August of information relating 
to the terms of a Treasury financing. Mr. Holland suggested that cop-
ies of the correspondence be furnished to all Federal Reserve Banks for 
their information, and it was understood that that would be done.

Bamerical International Financial Corporation. There had been 
distributed a memorandum dated June 10, 1968, from the Division of 
Examinations relating to the request of Bamerical International Finan-
cial Corporation, San Francisco, California, for permission to acquire 
additional shares of Societe Financiere Europeenne, Paris, and Societe 
Financiere Europeenne Holding, Luxembourg, in order to assume its 
proportionate share of capital increases of both companies. 
The memorandum recommended, for reasons set forth therein, 
that the request be approved despite the fact that the investment 
would not be strictly in conformity with the current general policy 
against equity investments by Edge corporations in developed countries 
°f continental Western Europe. 
Governor Brimmer expressed doubt that an exception to the 
general policy was warranted. He was concerned about a situation in 
which an American company having an interest in a foreign institution 
could exert its influence in favor of a capital increase and then apply 
t o the Board for permission to maintain its relative standing. He also 
questioned whether Bamerical, which had been reporting on a separate 
basis, should now be permitted to combine its ceiling under the foreign 
credit restraint program with those of its parent bank and Bank of 
America, New York. 
In discussion of these points Governor Mitchell expressed the 
view that Board approval of entrance by an Edge corporation into a 

* r y 
6/13/68 
-4-
partnership role with foreign banks carried with it an implied require-
ment for subsequent approval of additional investments in order to 
maintain proportionate interests. He noted that in the present 
instances Bamerical was an equal owner with several European banks. 
In answer to questions from members of the Board, the staff 
indicated that most Edge corporations had opted to combine their ceil-
ings under the foreign credit restraint program with those of the 
• • 
- , u 
' :.1 
parent bank. Once the ceilings were combined, it was understood that 
they could not be separated. However, it had been the general practice 
to approve requests to combine ceilings even though initially separate 
ceilings had been established. 
The staff also pointed out that apparently a general agreement 
among the partners to increase the capital of the two European concerns 
during 1968 was reached prior to January 1. 
Following additional comments, it was understood that the ques-
tion would be considered further by the staff and brought back to the 
Board for determination. 
Report on competitive factors. A report to the Comptroller of 
the Currency on the competitive factors involved in the proposed merger 
°f Rumford Bank and Trust Company, Rumford, Maine, and First National 
v.a c:. 
• 
• •. 
Bank of Portland, Portland, Maine, was approved for transmittal to the 
{. :. ir-J, V- , ' 
' 
Comptroller. The conclusion read as follows: 

6/13/68 
-5-
There is little, if any, existing competition 
between Rumford Bank and Trust Company and First National 
Bank of Portland, although there is potential for competi-
tion between them. Consummation of the proposed transac-
tion would increase the concentration of banking resources 
held by a few large banks in the State of Maine. Rumford 
Bank holds more than half of the deposits of commercial 
banks in its market area and this position would be 
assumed by the second largest bank in the State. The 
overall competitive effect would be adverse. 
Governor Robertson noted that he would have preferred the con-
clusion recommended by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, namely, that 
the proposed merger would have a substantially adverse effect on com-
petition. 
Members of the staff except Messrs. Holland, Partee, and Wood 
then withdrew from the meeting. 
Agency issues. Governor Robertson reported on further discus-
sions with Under Secretary Barr of the Treasury concerning means of 
More forcefully presenting Federal Reserve and Treasury arguments 
against passage of the so-called Proxmire amendment to S. 3133 con-
cerning System purchases of agency issues. 
The Board members discussed the implications of the proposed 
a^,';* V 
'••• 
............ 
amendment anc* exchanged views as to possible interpretations of its 
language, or modifications thereof, if in the last analysis some 
version of the amendment proved to be capable of passage by the 
c°ngress. 
it was sugges ted that the text of the amendment and per-
tinent background information be supplied to the members of the 

<C"C 
6/13/68 
-6-
Federal Open Market Committee, and that the matter be discussed at the 
meeting of the Committee scheduled for June 18. 
Appointment of Mr. Shull. Governor Sherrill reported to the 
Board the recommendation of the Director of the Division of Research 
and Statistics that Bernard Shull, currently Chief of the Banking 
Markets Section, be appointed Assistant Adviser in the Division of 
Research and Statistics. It was contemplated, he said, that Mr. Shull 
would continue to perform substantially his current duties. The change 
being recommended by the Division had figured in its future plans, but 
it was being proposed at this time in view of the fact that Mr. Shull 
had been offered an attractive position by one of the Federal Reserve 
Banks. Governor Sherrill stated that he concurred in the Division's 
/ 
recommendation, and the Board approved the proposed action. The pre-
cise salary to be associated with the new title was left to be formally 
established at the time officer salaries were reviewed in connection 
with the general Government pay increase, but it was felt that an 
increa se of $600 over the level of Mr. Shull's current salary step 
under the presumptive new pay scale would be appropriate. 
Secretary's Note: Acting in the absence 
of Governor Sherrill, Governor Robertson 
approved on behalf of the Board on June 28, 
1968, an annual salary of $25,000 for Mr. 
Shull as Assistant Adviser, effective 
July 14, 1968. 
Report by Haskins & Sells. Governor Sherrill reported to the 
Board that he had received from Haskins & Sells a report on the firm's 

< >• > • 
6/13/68 
-7-
1967 review of procedures followed in examinations of the Federal 
Reserve Banks. Mr. Larkin of Haskins & Sells had supplemented the 
report in conversation with Governor Sherrill. He had noted that 
Haskins & Sells, which was winding up its five years of review of the 
examining function, had substantially achieved its basic aim of shift-
ing the emphasis in examination from the substantiation of balances to 
evaluation of prescribed internal controls. The firm regarded the 
management of the Board's field examining staff as adequate, but some-
what thin. In terms of succession, only one staff member appeared to 
have adequate potential, and it was suggested that the Board might want 
to follow his performance and development carefully. Haskins & Sells 
judged that the quality of the field examining staff was improving, but 
it felt that the Board should be careful in future recruiting efforts 
to keep adding to the staff men whose training was oriented to modern 
auditing techniques. The firm wished to encourage the further develop-
ment and use of statistical sampling methods in the examining process, 
and favored the addition to the staff of personnel trained in that 
concept. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Board under delegated authority as
