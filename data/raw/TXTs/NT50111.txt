Cost of handling country checks (Item No. 3). There had been 
distributed a draft of letter to President Hickman of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland relating to his request for a review by the 
Board of the desirability of the existing practice of including postage 
and expressage in the total cost per thousand items shown for country 
checks for purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Expenses and 
Functional Data compiled by the Board. For reasons set forth in a 
letter to the Board dated June 22, 1967, President Hickman recommended 
that the practice, inaugurated effective January 1, 1967, be discon-
tinued. Part of President Hickman's concern appeared to stem from the 
fact that the rating of the Cleveland Reserve Bank in unit cost com-
parisons between Reserve Banks was lower when postage and expressage 
charge costs were included. The matter had previously been the subject 
of correspondence between President Hickman and Governor Mitchell, at 
which time Governor Mitchell indicated that it was the intention of the 
Board to show unit costs both with and without postage and expressage 
charges. 
The proposed reply would note the exchange of correspondence 
between President Hickman and Governor Mitchell, indicate that the 
Board concurred in the views expressed by Governor Mitchell in his 
letter of December 6, 1966, and state that the Board saw no need to 
change the existing reporting procedure. It would point out that the 
Board considered the functional expense reports as being primarily 

7/12/67 
-3-
intended to provide a basis for comparisons showing a Bank's costs over 
a period of time and to determine whether cost trends were consistent 
with experience at other Banks. When questions were raised by the com-
parisons, the functional expense data would also provide a basis for 
further investigations of the factors responsible for costs that seemed 
out of line. The letter would further state that the Board felt such 
investigations were necessary before any significant conclusions could 
be reached with respect to inter-Bank comparisons of unit costs, but 
notwithstanding this reservation, the Board shared President Hickman's 
view that the functional expense reports provided a stimulus to improve 
operations and lower costs. In conclusion the letter would indicate 
that the Board noted the accomplishments achieved by the Cleveland Bank 
in this direction. 
During discussion, Governor Mitchell suggested certain changes 
in the proposed letter to clarify that the Board, beginning with the 
first quarterly report for 1967, was showing unit costs in the Consoli-
dated Statement both with and without postage and expressage charges. 
He observed that such a position should satisfy both the Reserve Bank 
and the Board, and he made additional suggestions that would point up 
the view that the procedure would provide a better basis for investiga-
tions of reasons for differences in unit costs. 
Unanimous approval was then given to a letter to President 
Hickman in the form attached as Item No. 3.

Report on automatic data processing activities (Item No. 4). 
There had been distributed a draft of letter to the Bureau of the Budget 
with respect to its circular No. A-83, effective April 20, 1967, under 
which certain reports were requested relating to automatic data process-
ing activities. The draft letter would indicate that the Board would 
cooperate in furnishing certain of the data requested under this pro-
gram but call attention to the fact that the Board did not operate under 
appropriated funds, that its fiscal year was the calendar year, and that 
the reports would cover automatic data processing equipment at the Board 
but not at the Reserve Banks. With reference to the sharing of avail-
able automatic data processing resources, the letter would further indi-
cate that the Board would be glad to continue to consider requests for 
use of its facilities by other Federal agencies on an individual basis. 
In discussion, Mr. Byrne sketched the background against which 
the draft letter had been prepared. The general purpose of the Brooks 
Act (Public Law 89-306), which became effective October 20, 1965, was 
to achieve coordinated management of automatic data processing on a 
Government-wide basis, with extensive authority vested in the Adminis-
trator of General Services. The law contained requirements, among others, 
relating to annual reporting of equipment inventory, utilization, and 
acquisition in conjunction with submission of budget estimates to the 
Bureau of the Budget and to the Congress. Incident to the Act, the 
Bureau of the Budget had instituted a management information system, 

2 7 8 9 
7/12/67 
-5-
some of the purposes of which would be to establish and maintain a per-
petual inventory of electronic data processing equipment and facilitate 
improved management of relevant activities. 
Mr. Byrne noted that the question of Board posture with respect 
to the activities contemplated by the Act was considered at the Board 
meeting on January 23, 1967, at which time the Data Processing and Legal 
Divisions recommended that the Board adopt a passive stand with respect 
to current and future requirements under the Brooks Act. (Mr. O'Connell 
was of the view that the Act was geared to the appropriations process 
and technically the Board would appear to be excluded.) Question was 
raised at that meeting as to the extent to which the Board might coop-
erate with the Bureau of the Budget in matters of reporting and consult-
ing without committing itself to adherence to the program, and it was 
understood that the staff would pursue the matter further in the light 
of the discussion. 
Subsequently, a staff group consisting of Messrs. Sherman, 
Cardon, O'Connell, and Byrne sought, without success, to arrange a 
meeting with representatives of the Bureau of the Budget for the pur-
pose of discussing the extent of the Board's participation in the 
Bureau's program. In view of the fact that the first report under the 
Budget Bureau's circular was due later this month, the staff felt that 
a letter from Chairman Martin to the Director of the Budget Bureau, 
assuring him of the Board's desire to cooperate as indicated but 

2770 
7/12/67 
-6-
pointing out certain limitations in the data that could be supplied, 
would be helpful. 
Discussion at today's meeting revealed support of the objective 
pursued in the draft letter. Governor Daane suggested some editorial 
changes in the tone of the letter, as did Governor Mitchell. 
Unanimous approval was then given to a letter from Chairman 
Mar tin to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget in the form attached 
as Item No. 4. 
Annex building (Items 5 and 6). Mr. Shepardson described cer-
tain papers to be filed by the Board with the District of Columbia 
Government in order to obtain permission to excavate and use underground 
space that would extend beyond the Board's property line, as well as an 
application relating to two tunnels under C Street to provide communica-
tion between the Board's present building and the annex. 
Upon request of Mr. Shepardson, the Secretary was authorized to 
execute and send the necessary letters and agreement. Copies of the 
letters subsequently transmitted are attached as Items 5 and 6. 
Mr. Shepardson also referred to a meeting yesterday with the 
Executive Director of the National Capital Planning Commission with 
respect to the stand taken by the Fine Arts Commission on the general 
design of the proposed annex building. From the discussion it appeared 
that although the role of the Fine Arts Commission was principally 
advisory, only rarely did the Planning Commission, from whom the Board 

7/12/67 
-7-
would be required to obtain a building permit, go contrary to the rec-
ommendation of the Fine Arts Commission. The Executive Director of the 
Planning Commission indicated some sympathy with the position in which 
the Board found itself and suggested a possible approach that would be 
pursued as soon as cost estimates and plans were available from the 
architects. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
Secretary's Notes: Pursuant to the under-
standing at the meeting on June 23, 1967, 
letters were sent today to all Federal 
Reserve Banks except New York advising 
that the Board was prepared to approve, 
upon request, a special maximum of $22,000 
for Grade 16 of the employee salary struc-
tures. A copy of the letter sent to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is attached 
as Item No. 7; the letters to the other 
Reserve Banks were in similar form. 
A letter was sent today to Bank of America 
National Trust and Savings Association, San 
Francisco, California, acknowledging receipt 
of notice of its intent to establish an addi-
tional branch in Germany, to be located in 
Frankfurt am Main. 
Acting in the absence of Governor Robertson, 
Governor Sherrill today approved on behalf 
of the Board the following items: 
Memorandum from the Division of Research and Statistics dated 
July 6, 1967, recommending that Ann P. Ulrey be appointed as a con-
sultant effective until December 31, 1967, with compensation at the 
rate of $65 per day, so that she might, among other things, continue 
her work on a monograph on the U.S. capital markets, with the under-
standing that transportation expenses and per diem would be paid in 
accordance with the Board's travel regulations. 
(In this connection, 
Governor Sherrill also authorized any resulting overexpenditure in the 
Pertinent account of the 1967 budget of the Division.)

Referring Board's August 13, 1964, letter 
(F. R.L.S. #3049) concerning procedures to alleviate coin 
shortage, Board has concluded, with concurrence of Director 
of the Mint, that rebagging of halves no longer serves any 
useful purpose under existing conditions and may be 
discontinued. Authority to discontinue rebagging other 
denominations of coin was previously given in Board's letters 
of March 15, 1965, and August 16, 1965, and telegrams of 
January 5, 1966, and March 10, 1966.

AIR MAIL 
Mr. W. Braddock Hickman, President, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 
Cleveland, Ohio 44101. 
Dear Mr. Hickman: 
This is in response to your letter of June 22, 1967, 
referring to the Board's Consolidated Statement of Expenses 
and Functional Data, and requesting a review by the Board of 
the desirability of the existing practice of including postage 
and expressage in the total cost per thousand items shown for 
country checks. 
In considering your request, the Board noted that 
this matter was discussed in an earlier exchange of corres-
pondence between you and Governor Mitchell. Beginning with 
the first quarterly report for 1967, these data are shown 
with postage included and excluded in order to accommodate 
an analysis on either basis. Accordingly, the Board sees no 
need to change the existing reporting procedure. 
The Board feels that information presented in this 
manner will provide a better basis for investigations of the 
reasons for differences in unit costs, and it believes that 
such investigations are necessary before any significant con-
clusions can be reached with respect to inter-Bank comparisons 
of those costs. In other words, the fact that a Bank has the 
lowest unit cost for an operation does not necessarily mean 
that it has the most efficient procedures. Before such a 
conclusion could be reached, the scope of the work that has 
to be done and other relevant factors at the different Banks 
must be taken into account. In the Check Collection function, 
for instance, Chicago with a requirement of about 2,900 sorts--
at least four or five times the number required at most other 
banks--could never hope to achieve the Number 1 ranking., 

Mr. W. Braddock Hickman 
- 2 -
Notwithstanding this reservation about the significance 
of the ranking in unit costs, the Board shares your view that the 
functional expense reports provide a stimulus to improve operations 
and lower costs, and it has noted the accomplishments your Bank has 
achieved in this direction. 
Very truly yours, 
U: .

Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System is planning the construction of an annex to its 
present building on Lot 805, Square E-87, property which 
it now owns. 
In this connection, the Board is herewith filing 
application for vault space projecting beyond our property 
line. 
It is noted in the attached Vault Agreement that 
the owners agree to pay such rental as may be prescribed by 
the District of Columbia. However, it is the Board's under-
standing that no rental is required for such vault space 
from Departments or Agencies of the Federal Government. 
Since the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System is a Federal Agency created by the Federal Reserve 
Act, it is respectfully requested that this request for 
vault space be approved, free of any rental charge for such 
space. 
Very truly yours,

Dear Sir: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System is planning the construction of an annex to its 
present building on Lot 805, Square E-87, property which 
it now owns. 
The plans call for two tunnels under "C" Street 
connecting the two buildings, one a personnel tunnel and 
the other a service tunnel. The personnel tunnel from the 
present building to the curb line on the north side of "C" 
Street was constructed at the time the present building was 
erected. 
This letter is to request authorization for the 
completion of this tunnel and an additional parallel service 
tunnel as shown on the attached plans. 
Very truly yours

Mr. Everett N. Case, 
Federal Reserve Agent, 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 
New York, New York. 10045 
Dear Mr. Caser 
Acting under delegated authority, the Director of the 
Division of Personnel Administration has approved the appointment of 
Mr. Peter D. Luce as Federal Reserve Agent's Representative at the 
Buffalo Branch to succeed Mr. Donald J. Weber. 
This approval is given with the understanding that Mr. Luce 
will be solely responsible to the Federal Reserve Agent and the Board 
of Governors for the proper performance of his duties, except that, 
during the absence or disability of the Federal Reserve Agent or a 
vacancy in that office, his responsibility will be to the Assistant 
Federal Reserve Agent and the Board of Governors. 
When not engaged in the performance of his duties as Federal 
Reserve Agent's Representative, Mr. Luce may, with the approval of the 
Federal Reserve Agent and the Vice President in charge of the Buffalo 
Branch, perform such work for the Branch as will not be inconsistent 
with the duties as Federal Reserve Agent's Representative. 
It will be appreciated if Mr. Luce is fully informed of the 
importance of his responsibilities as a member of the staff of the 
Federal Reserve Agent and the need for maintenance of independence from 
the operations of the Bank in the discharge of these responsibilities. 
Please have Mr. Luce execute the usual Oath of Office which 
should then be forwarded to the Board of Governors along with notifica-
tion of the effective date of his appointment. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Merritt Sherman 
Merritt Sherman, 
Secretary.
