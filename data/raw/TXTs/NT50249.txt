This will acknowledge your recent letter to Chairman Martin 
in which you expressed concern about the effect on the jewelry industry 
the amendments to the Treasury's gold regulations under which the 
Treasury will no longer purchase gold in the private market or sell 
gold for industrial, professional, or artistic uses. As you recognize, 
control and regulation of all matters having to do with gold is by law 
v^sted in the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. 
The action on the part of the Treasury to which you refer 
was necessary to implement, from the standpoint of the United States, 
one of the agreements reached at the international monetary conference 
^eld in Washington on March 16-17, 1968, and attended by the governors 
the several central banks that had been active contributors to the 
gold pool. There is enclosed a copy of the communique issued at the 
conclusion of that meeting, and your attention is called particularly 
t o the final paragraph on the second page. Also enclosed is a copy of 
announcement by the Treasury of the amendments to its gold regula-
tions . 
We understand from the Treasury that new gold marketing 
a rrangements are being worked out by private industry, that a better 
supply of gold is already becoming available to licensed users 
rÂ°ugh the private market, and that continued improvement in the 
a ituation is expected. Accordingly, it appears that the immediate 
Problem resulting from the change in the gold regulations may soon 
be substantially alleviated. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert C. Holland

Secretary.
