The December 4 memorandum from Governor Robertson also recommended 
salary increases for members of the officer staff according to an attached 
schedule, such schedule being based on an anticipated general Government 
pay increase of 4.5 per cent. The Secretary was informed that the 
recommended salary increases were approved unanimously contingent on 
the approval of the general Government pay increase and to be effective 
as of the date of such increase. (Note: The general Government pay 
increase was subsequently approved effective retroactive to October 8, 
1967.)

At the conclusion of the executive session Messrs. Sherman, 
Secretary; Kenyon, Assistant Secretary; and Johnson, Director, Division 
of Personnel Administration, joined the meeting. 
Salaries of Presidents and First Vice Presidents. Governor 
Mitchell, as Chairman of the Committee on Organization, Compensation, 
and Building Plans, reviewed the decision reached by the Board on 
December 2, 1967, to amend its guidelines in such fashion as to make 
a number of Federal Reserve Bank Presidents and First Vice Presidents 
eligible for salary increases effective January 1, 1968. He then 

»

referred to tabulations distributed under date of December 5 showing, 
in individual cases, the effect of the amendment of the guidelines. 
The individual cases were reviewed and in most instances the 
proposed annual salary rates, effective January 1, 1968, as shown in 
the tabulations, were indicated to be acceptable. Accordingly, it 
was agreed to send letters to the Chairmen of the respective Reserve 
Banks advising them that such rates would be approved by the Board 
of Governors if fixed by the directors of the Banks concerned. Copies 
of the letters sent to the Chairmen of seven of the Reserve Banks 
pursuant to this action are attached as Items 1 through 7. 
The Board also considered the situation at other Reserve Banks 
where special circumstances prevailed. 
First, information had been received from the Chairman of the 
Philadelphia Bank that it appeared likely that Mr. Bopp would elect 
to retire from his position as President in the near future and that 
First Vice President Hilkert might elect to retire at the same time. 
Retirement options that would appear to be available to Mr. Bopp were 
mentioned, including retirement on disability, and it was understood 
that Governor Mitchell would discuss the situation further with 
Chairman Winn. (Note: A copy of the letter subsequently sent to 
Chairman Winn is attached as Item No. 8.) 
At the Richmond Bank, where President Wayne was to retire 
at the end of February, it was understood that the directors contemplated 

,

-7-
the appointment of Aubrey N. Heflin, now First Vice President, to 
succeed Mr. Wayne and the appointment of Robert P. Black as First 
Vice President. 
It was indicated that the Board was prepared to approve such 
appointments, and the question raised was with respect to the beginning 
salary rates for Messrs. Heflin and Black that would be considered 
appropriate. Chairman Martin suggested that that question be studied 
by the Committee on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans, 
with the understanding that the Board would support the Committee's 
conclusions, and there was agreement with the Chairman's proposal. 
(Note: The Committee concluded that beginning salary rates of $37,500 
for Mr. Heflin and $27,500 for Mr. Black would be appropriate. A copy 
of the letter sent to the Chairman of the Richmond Bank is attached 
as Item No. 9.) 
As to the Atlanta Bank, where it appeared that the retirement 
of President Patterson was in the offing and that the Bank's directors 
contemplated the appointment of Monroe Kimbrel, now First Vice President, 
to succeed Mr. Patterson, it was agreed that the Chairman of the Bank 
should be reminded of the eligibility of Mr. Kimbrel for a $4,000 salary 
increase effective January 1, 1968, under the Board's guidelines and that 
if matters proceeded in the way that seemed likely the Board's Committee 
on Organization, Compensation, and Building Plans would undertake to 
have a discussion with Mr. Kimbrel.

As to the St. Louis Bank, Governor Mitchell reported that 
Chairman Peirce had urged granting to President Francis and First Vice 
President Lewis, effective January 1, 1968, larger salary increases than 
those for which they would be eligible under the Board's guidelines 
($5,000 and $4,000, respectively). It had been left that Chairman 
Peirce would correspond with Chairman Martin, if he so desired, after 
giving the matter further thought. (Note: Governor Mitchell subsequently 
discussed this matter with Chairman Peirce. A copy of the letter sent 
to Mr. Peirce is attached as Item No. 10.) 
As to the Minneapolis Bank, Governor Mitchell reported that 
Chairman Swan and Deputy Chairman Leach had indicated that the directors 
would like to obtain a salary increase for President Galusha, who was 
not presently eligible for such an increase under the Board's guidelines. 
It had been left that Messrs. Swan and Leach would consider whether they 
wanted to pursue the matter further. 
As to the Dallas Bank, where President Irons was to retire at 
the end of next January, Governor Mitchell reported that Chairman 
Thornsen had in mind a plan whereby First Vice President Coldwell would 
be appointed to succeed Mr. Irons and T. W. Plant would be appointed 
as First Vice President, with the understanding, however, that at the 
end of his term Mr. Plant would take a position as Senior Vice President 
and would be succeeded as First Vice President by a younger officer. 
The plan was indicated to be acceptable to the members of the 
Board. It was understood that the Committee on Organization, Compensation, 

4 7 0 3

-9-
and Building Plans would consider what beginning salaries would seem 
appropriate for the new President and First Vice President, that their 
conclusions would be supported by the Board, and that appropriate advice 
would be communicated to the Dallas Reserve Bank. (Note: The Committee 
concluded that beginning salary rates of $37,500 for Mr. Coldwell and 
$29,500 for Mr. Plant would be appropriate. A copy of the letter sent 
to the Chairman of the Dallas Bank is attached as Item No. 11.) 
Officer salaries at Minneapolis. Unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis approving the 
payment of salaries, effective January 1, 1968, to officers of the 
Bank (other than the President and First Vice President) at the annual 
rates fixed by the Bank's directors. A copy is attached as Item No. 12. 
Director appointments. In view of the unavailability of 
Mr. Robert Dickey, III, President of the Dravo Corporation, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, for appointment to a second two-year term as a director 
of the Pittsburgh Branch, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Board 
agreed to ascertain through the Chairman of the Bank whether Dr. Richard M. 
Cyert, Dean of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, would accept 
appointment, if tendered, for the two-year term beginning January 1, 
1968, with the understanding that if it were found that he would accept, 
the appointment would be made. (Note: It developed that Dr. Cyert was on 
sabbatical leave and probably would not return to the United States 
until September 1968.)

Chairman Martin reported that Mr. Everett N. Case had agreed 
to continue to serve as Chairman and Federal Reserve Agent of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York during 1968 and that Mr. Kenneth H. 
Hannan would serve again during that year as Deputy Chairman. 
The designation of Mr. Case and the appointment of Mr. Hannan 
w e r e approved unanimously. 
Chairman Martin also reported that he had not yet concluded 
his discussions with respect to appointments at the Boston and Atlanta 
Reserve Banks. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Memorandum from Messrs. Kakalec, F. Solomon, and Hackley dated 
November 29, 1967, containing the following recommendations with respect 
to the question whether payment by the Board for travel involved under 
the program whereby members of the field examining staff of the Division 
of Examinations are authorized, subject to certain limitations, to make 
weekend visits at Board expense to their places of residence up to a 
maximum of six visits per calendar quarter would constitute taxable 
income to the employees: (1) that no general ruling from the Internal 
Revenue Service be sought at this time; (2) that if a clear-cut ruling 
should be made in a specific case that such payments are taxable, the 
Board be prepared to reimburse the examiner for the tax so assessed; 
and (3) that the current practice be continued of making per diem 
payments to examiners while examining Reserve Banks in or near cities 
in which they maintain residences and also while they are in Washington 
on official business. 
On the dates shown, actions were taken on 
behalf of the Board under delegated authority 
as reflected in the following letters, copies

Dear Spike: 
As you know from the discussion last Friday at the Chairmen's 
Conference, the Board does not feel that this is an appropriate time in 
which to change the salary ranges or structures applicable to Reserve 
Bank officers. The Board is, however, working toward a revision of some 
of those ranges in the light of studies made during the past year with a 
view to agreeing upon new structures that would be applicable to calen-
dar year 1969. 
In the meantime, the Board has considered whether a reduction 
in the intervals for salary increases for the Presidents and First Vice 
Presidents might be made within the present ranges, since most of those 
officers would not be eligible for salary increases at the beginning of 
1968 under the terms of the Board's letter of November 3, 1965. The 
purpose of this letter is to let you know that the Board is prepared to 
approve adjustments, as of January 1, 1968, for roughly proportionate 
amounts of the increases that would be permissible a year later. In the 
case of your Bank, the Board would be prepared to approve an increase in 
the salary of President Ellis of $3,500 to a rate of $43,500 per year, 
and an increase of $2,500 to a rate of $34,000 per year for First Vice 
President Latham, effective January 1, 1968, if so fixed by your Directors. 
With all good wishes, 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Bill

Dear Joyce: 
As you know from the discussion last Friday at the Chairmen's 
Conference, the Board does not feel that this is an appropriate time in 
which to change the salary ranges or structures applicable to Reserve 
Bank officers. The Board is, however, working toward a revision of some 
of those ranges in the light of studies made during the past year with a 
view to agreeing upon new structures that would be applicable to calen-
dar year 1969. 
In the meantime, the Board has considered whether a reduction 
in the intervals for salary increases for the Presidents and First Vice 
Pre sidents might be made within the present ranges, since most of those 
officers would not be eligible for salary increases at the beginning of 
1968 under the terms of the Board's letter of November 3, 1965. ' The 
Purpose of this letter is to let you know that the Board is prepared to 
approve adjustments, as of January 1, 1968, for roughly proportionate 
amounts of the increases that would be permissible a year later. In the 
case of your Bank, the Board would be prepared to approve an increase in 
the salary of First Vice President Strothman of $2,500 to a rate of 
$31,500 per year, if so fixed by your Directors. 
Will all good wishes, 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Bill

effective January 1, 1968, if so fixed by your Directors. 
The Board is also prepared to approve an increase of $4,000 to 
a rate of $31,500 per year for First Vice President Boysen, as permitted

Dear Sir: 
The Director of the Division of Bank Operations 
acting under delegated authority, has approved certain 
revisions to the Accounting Manual, effective January 1, 
1968. A brief description of the revisions and a set 
of the revised pages are enclosed. 
A supply of the revised pages needed for 
insertion in the Manuals at your Bank is being sent under 
separate cover. 
Very truly yours,

TO THE PRESIDENTS OF ALL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. 

4 7 i 2 7 
M E M O R A N D U M 
The accompanying pages of the Accounting Manual, dated 
January 1, 1968, contain revisions which are explained briefly below. 
Page 59 
The phrase "charges on used pouches returned to Washington" 
has been added to Item 19(b), Shipping charges on new currency. 
Page 102 
Function title "Services Rendered Others—Reimbursable" has 
been changed to "Services Rendered Others." 
Page 106 
The phrase following the word "performed" in the first 
sentence of the fourth paragraph has been deleted, without change in 
meaning. 
Page 107 
The first paragraph reflects change in policy regarding 
all 
ocation of time and salaries of employees loaned to others than a 
Reserve Bank. Hereafter all time of such employees and salaries should 
be charged to Services Rendered Others, whether reimbursable or not. 
(This causes the changes described below regarding pages 120 and 231, 
but does not change the intent of the last paragraph on page 106.) 
The second full paragraph repeats, with slight clarification, 
the substance of the instruction relating to officers loaned to others 
than a Reserve Bank. 
The fourth paragraph has been revised to clarify the fact that 
all military service contributions to the Retirement System should be 
allocated to the General Overhead function. 
Page 108 
Direct allocation of Postage and expressage to the Country 
Checks unit has been provided for in that unit since January 1, 1967. 
The paragraph under "Postage and expressage" on page 108 has been 
expanded to reflect this change. 

4 7 2 8 
-2-
Pages 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, and 114-1 
Instructions on these pages were formerly shown on pages 110, 
111, 112, 112-1, 112-2, 112-3, 113, 114, and 114-1. The instructions 
regarding "furniture and equipment purchases," "furniture and equipment 
rentals," and "usage charges on Bank-owned furniture and equipment" have 
been rearranged for clarification, without change in substance. 
Duplications and examples now considered unnecessary have been deleted. 
The "note" shown on page 114 has been expanded to call attention to the 
"note" on page 104 regarding distribution of charges to the Federal 
Reserve Currency Verification unit. 
Page 116 
In recent years, the term "net expense" has been used with 
two meanings in the Accounting Manual--to indicate the amount of expense 
remaining in a function or unit (a) after distribution of some costs to 
another function or unit and (b) after deduction of reimbursements. To 
eliminate this source of confusion, the title "Undistributed expense" 
will, hereafter, be used in connection with the "a" definition above 
and the title "Net expense" will be limited to the "b" definition above. 
Accordingly, the term "Net expense" in the first paragraph on page 116 
has been changed to "Undistributed expense." The same change has also 
been made on the following pages--
121 
137 
147

143

135 
144 
136

Page 120 
To the General Overhead function has been added the operation 
"Employee performing duties of Secretary of the Conference of Presidents." 
The activity "Employees loaned to others . . . " has been 
transferred to the function, Services Rendered Others, on page 231.
