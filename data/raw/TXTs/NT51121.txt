statement of Governors Mitchell and Brimmer, is attached under Item No. 6. 
This completed consideration of the consent calendar. 
Proposed Federal funds transactions. At the Board's meeting on 
September 27, 1973, consideration had been given to a proposal by the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board to engage, through its district banks, in 
Federal funds transactions on behalf of its member savings and loan 
associations. With a memorandum of October 3, 1973, Mr. Axilrod trans-
mitted to the Board certain additional information with respect to the 
Proposal, together with a draft letter responding to the FHLBB. 
Today's discussion evidenced a growing opposition to the 
Proposal on the part of Board members, principally because the proposal, 
l n permitting further expansion in bank credit, would be contrary to 
current attempts toward monetary restraint; would give participating 
savings and loan associations an unfair advantage over other sellers 
unsecured Federal funds in that the Federal Home Loan Banks would 
assume all risk involved; and could result in undue concentration of 
market power in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

To reflect these views, several changes in the draft letter 
were suggested. It was understood that a revised letter would be 
presented to the Board for its consideration at a later date. It was 
further understood that consideration would be given by the staff to 
the need for a comprehensive study of the operation of the Federal 
funds market, including eligibility for participation in such market. 
The meeting proceeded from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Proposed amendment to Regulation Q. On October 2, 1973, Congress 
Passed a joint resolution that would require the Federal regulatory 
agencies to establish a ceiling on interest rates for 4-year time 
deposits of less than $100,000. In a memorandum of October 4, 1973, 
the Division of Research and Statistics presented for the Board's 
consideration several alternative courses of action for amending Regu-
lation Q, Interest on Deposits to implement this legislation if signed 
by 
the President. The Division recommended that regardless of the rate 
structure eventually adopted, the existing quantitative limitation and 
the minimum denomination requirement be eliminated. 
Today's preliminary discussion was for the purpose of providing 
guidance to Governor Mitchell for a meeting of the Interagency Coordinating 
Committee on Bank Regulation scheduled to be held later today. During 
the discussion, a consensus evolved that the Board (1) should accept no 
interest rate ceiling on such deposits below 7 per cent for banks; (2) 
would prefer the customary 1/4 per cent rate differential for thrift 

3875 
10/4/73 
-5-
mstitutions but might be willing to increase this to 1/2 per cent; 
and (3) would eliminate the quantitative limitation. 
All staff members then withdrew except Messrs. Feldberg, Allison, 
Altmann, Bernard, Broida, Melnicoff, Coyne, O'Brien, O'Connell, Solomon, 
Keir, Ettin, Reynolds, Leavitt, and other supporting staff. 
Discount rate. On October 3, 1973, the board of directors of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had voted to establish, subject to 
review and determination by the Board of Governors, a rate of 7-1/4 
Per cent on loans to member banks under sections 13 and 13a of the 
federal Reserve Act. The current rate at all Reserve Banks was 7-1/2 
Per cent. The directors had also acted to establish correspondingly 
lower rates on advances under other sections of the Act. 
After discussion, the Board members decided that it would not 
be desirable to reduce the discount rate at this time. They agreed 
with Governor Holland's view that a delay in adjusting the rate to the 
recent declines in short-term interest rates would be advantageous and 
would be a natural counterpart of the previous policy of allowing the 
rate to lag well behind the rise in market rates. That view was reinforced 
by the fact that despite large recent declines most short-term rates 
were still above the current discount rate, in some instances substantially 
s°. Moreover, the Board members did not want to take an action that 
they felt was likely to be interpreted under present circumstances as 
an overt signal of a generally easier monetary policy stance. In this 
connection, it was suggested that the System might decide to use other 

3876 
10/4/73 
-6-
monetary policy instruments before the discount rate in a move toward 
a less restrictive policy position. 
After further discussion, the Board voted unanimously to 
disapprove the pending discount rate reduction, with the understanding 
that a letter outlining the two major considerations in the Board's 
decision would be sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It 
was also understood that the substance of the letter, without identi-
fication of the Bank involved, would be communicated to the Presidents 
°f the other Reserve Banks. 
A copy of the letter sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 
and a copy of the memorandum sent to the Presidents of the other Federal 
Reserve Banks, both dated October 4, 1973, are attached as Items 7 and 8. 
Other discount rates. The establishment without change by the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and 
Dallas on September 27, 1973, of the rates on advances and discounts in 
their existing schedules was approved unanimously, with the understanding 
that appropriate advice would be sent to those Banks. 
All staff members except Messrs. Feldberg and Melnicoff then 
withdrew, and Messrs. Doyle, Engstrom, and Kakalec joined the meeting. 
Federal Reserve Bank director rotation policy. At the Board 
meeting on September 13, 1973, there was a discussion of the Board's 
Policy with respect to the rotation of Class C directors, and the 
Su8gestion was made that consideration be given to shortening the 
Period of service of such directors. With a memorandum of October 1, 1973, 

3877 
10/4/73 
-7-
Governor Holland transmitted a memorandum from Mr. Metzger, dated 
September 26, 1973, recommending that the maximum term of service 
°f Class C directors, including Chairmen, be shortened to 7 years. 
After discussion, the Board agreed in principle to the recommen-
dation to shorten the maximum term of service of Class C directors to 
' years. it was understood that this proposed change in director 
rotation policy would be presented to Chairman Burns for his review 
a nd, if acceptable to him, circulated to the Reserve Bank Presidents 
f°r their comments and suggestions prior to formal adoption by the 
Board. 
Change in nonofficial salary structure. Effective October 1, 
1973, the salary structure of agencies of the Federal Government was 
increased on average by approximately 4.77 per cent. In a memorandum 
°f October 1, 1973, Governor Holland recommended that, in keeping with 
the Board's policy of maintaining its employees' salary structure 
eomparable to that of the other agencies of the Federal Government, the 
Board approve a general pay increase for all nonofficial employees under 
l t s regular salary schedule in the amount of approximately 4.77 per cent, 
and approve a $120,000 increase in the Board's budget with which to fund 
•-lie pay 
increase. The memorandum noted that the budget request included 
funds earmarked for certain official salary adjustments. 
During discussion, it was suggested that the Board act today 
°nly on nonofficial salaries and that the matter of official salary 
adjustments be considered by the Board at a later date. At the conclusion 

« >

of the discussion, the Board approved a general pay increase for 
all nonofficial employees under its regular salary schedule in the 
amount of approximately 4.77 per cent, effective October 14, 1973, 
and approved a $100,000 increase in the Board's 1973 budget with 
which to fund the pay increase, it being understood that possible 
official salary adjustments would be considered at a subsequent 
meeting. A copy of the Board's revised regular salary schedule is 
attached as Item No. 9. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Tennessee Bancshares is the smallest multibank holding company in the 
state and controls two banks, The Elount National Bank of Ilaryville, 
t i aryvili e ("Blount National") and Merchants and Farmers Bank, Greenback 
("Greenback Bank"), with aggregate deposits of $56.3 million, representing 
0 ^ 
* PGr cent of deposits in commercial banks in the State. Consummation of 
tl*e proposed merger would increase Union Planters' share of total State 
deposits approximately one-half percentage point and it would remain the 
second largest banking organization in Tennessee. 
Union Planters1 sole banking subsidiary is located in Memphis, 
S°me 400 miles west of the Maryville and Greenback areas, and is the largest 
of 
banking organizations in the Memphis banking market with 37.7 per 
Cetlt of total market deposits. The two banking subsidiaries of Tennessee 
Bai*cshares are located in the eastern portion of the State; Blount National 
(d 
deposits of $50.9 million) is the seventh largest of twelve banking 
0rSanizations in the Knoxville banking aarket^ with 5.4 per cent of total 
ePosits in the market; Greenback Bank (deposits of $5.4 million) serves a 
S m a U area in southeastern Loudon county and the Vonore area of northern

competition between them and that none is likely to develop in the future.

do not- compete with any subsidiary of Tennessee Bancshares. Consummation

The financial condition and managerial resources of Union 
Pla

Beacon Leasing, organized in 1971, operates out of a single 
°ffice located in North Palm Beach, Florida, and is presently engaged 
i n losing office funiture and equipment, apartment appliances, hospital 
ar*d medical equipment, accounting machines, construction equipment, 
a n d automobiles and trucks. Such leases,with the exception of a 
auto leases,are consistent with the requirements of a full payout 
lease, as Beacon Leasing recovers in full its acquisition cost of leased 
ecluipment through rentals alone during the initial term of the lease 
(12 CFR 225.4(a) ( 6 ) ) D u r i n g calendar year 1972, Beacon Leasing 
0ri8inated lease receivables of $1.1 million. The major share of 
beacon Leasing's activity is conducted in Palm Beach and Broward 
c°unties. While Applicant's banking subsidiaries are concentrated 
l n Palm 
Beach County, such subsidiaries are not engaged in any 
leasing activities. In its markets, Beacon Leasing competes with 
over 20 leasing companies. It appears that the overall market for 
basing of personal property in Palm Beach County is highly com-
Petitive and acquisition of Beacon Leasing would not cause Appli-
C a n t to acquire a dominant position in any market area. It is un-
likely that the proposed acquisition would have any signficant adverse 
effect on competition in the market. 
It is anticipated that Applicant's acquisition of Beacon 
^easing would benefit the public by providing access to Applicant's 
greater financial resources, thereby aiding Beacon Leasing's growth. 
c0 f,'IIlesG leases, therefore, arc of a type different from those 
CorQi<iGrCd b y t h e B o a r d in the application of Centran Bancshares 
Poration to acquire Peoples Investment Company (1973 Federal 
S e r v e Bulletin 471-472).

A t the same time, Applicant will enter the leasing area on a small 
scale without assuming the risks associated with de novo entry, 
There is n o evidence in the record indicating that consummation of 
the proposed acquisition would result in undue concentration of 
tesources, unfair competition, conflicts of interest, unsound bank-
practices, or other adverse effects. 
Based upon the foregoing and other considerations reflected 
i n the record, the Board has determined that the balance of the public 
interest factors the Board is required to consider under section 
^ c)(8) is favorable. Accordingly, the application is hereby approved 
Suhject to Applicant's undertaking to dispose of its non full-payout 
automobile leases within 60 days from consummation of the acquisition. 
This determination is subject further to the conditions set forth in 
8 e cti 0 n 225.4(c) of Regulation Y and to the Board's authority to 
require s u c h modification or termination of the actiiities of a hold-
inS company or any of its subsidiaries as the Board finds necessary 
to assure compliance with the provisions and purposes of the Act 
a n d the Board's regulations and orders issued thereunder, or to prevent 
eVasion thereof. 
The transaction shall be consummated not later than three 
m°nths after the effective date of this Order, unless such period

FLORIDA BANCORP, INC. 
Order Approving Acquisition of Bank 
Florida Bancorp, Inc., Pompano Beach, Florida, a bank holding 
c°mpany within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, has applied 
the Board's approval under § 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 
l8^2(a)(3)) to acquire 90 per cent or more of the voting shares of 
Li8hthouse Point Bank, Lighthouse Point, Florida ("Bank"). 
Notice of the application, affording opportunity for inter-
ested 
persons to submit comments and views, has been given in accordance 
W i t h § 3(b) of the Acto The time for filing comments and views has 
^Pired, and the Board has considered the application and all comments 
teceived in light of the factors set forth in § 3(c) of the Act 
( l 2 U.S.C. 1842(c)). 
Applicant controls three banks with aggregate deposits of 
$65 •5 raillionj representing less than one per cent of the total deposits 
ill 
commercial banks in Florida, and is the twenty-sixth largest bank 
h°lding company in the State. (^11 banking data are as of June 30, 1972, 
justed to reflect holding company formations and acquisitions approved 
b y the Board through March 28, 1973.) Acquisition of Bank ($17.8 
illlon of deposits) would not result in a significant increase in the 
°ncentration of banking resources in Florida. 
The Department of Justice filed comments with regard to the 
pr°Posed acquisition of Bank concluding that Applicant's acquisition of 
would have a significantly adverse effect on competition in the 

3835 
-2« 
Greater Pompano Beach Area. The Department takes the position that the 
heater Pompano Beach Area is concentrated (the four leading organiza-
tions control about 78 per cent of the area's deposits) and that 
acquisition by Applicant (the second largest banking organization with 
16 o 
*9 Per cent of area deposits) of Bank would further increase banking 
c°ncentration (Applicant's share of area deposits would increase to 
Per cent). The Department also states that the facts support a 
Coi*clUalon t h a t t h e affiliation between Applicant and Bank is not so 
tr°ng as to preclude probable future competition. 
Based upon all of the relevant facts the Board finds the 
'ant market area is approximated by the northern two-thirds of 
County. There are nineteen banking organizations in the market 
' 
8 forty banks. Applicant presently controls 5.5 per cent of 
market a deposits and is the sixth largest banking organization in this 
market K 
where it competes with three of Florida's ten largest banking 
** zations. 
Acquisition of Bank would increase Applicant's market 
share t 
otlly 7 per cent and thus would not substantially increase 
^PPli 
i 
cant s share of deposits. There would be no adverse effect upon 
^is tin 
Qg competition; in fact, the acquisition should strengthen Appli-
cant anrf enable it to compete more effectively in a market that is 
' ^ n t r a t e d r 7 
Pj.-

bank h T ° S e d acquisitions in this market by two other of the ten largest 
not „ °lding companies in the State have been approved by the Board but 
1/ ^°nsummated. 
^atkpf-6./01117 l a r 8 e s t banking organizations control 66 per cent of the 
deposits.

3836 
Furthermore, consummation of the proposal would eliminate no 
significant existing competition between Applicant's subsidiaries and 
Bank due to their affiliation. Management of Applicant's lead bank was 
instrumental in the formation of Bank, and Applicant's lead bank and 
another subsidiary bank and Bank have been affiliated through common 
stock ownership and interlocking directors. Within the past sixteen 
m°nths the chairman of the board of Applicant and Bank was elected 
President of Bank, and it appears that the relationship between Appli-
C a n t a n d B a n k h a s been strengthened to the point that disaffiliation 
aPPears unlikely. Due to the strength of this affiliation, consummation 
0 f the proposal would not have a significant adverse effect on potential 
competition in the relevant market. 
The financial and managerial resources and future prospects 
f Applicant, its subsidiaries and Bank are generally satisfactory and 
insistent with approval of the application. There is no evidence that 
banking needs of the community are not being met. However, the 
ProPosed acquisition will result in internal efficiencies accruing to 
atlk w h i c h will enable it to compete more effectively in its own 
Service area. In addition, as previously noted, the proposal should 
ance Applicant's ability to compete in the market. Therefore, the 
nvenience and needs of the community to be served are consistent with 
approv 
v al of the application. It is the Board's judgment that the trans-
acti 
°n would be in the public interest and that the application should 
be „ 
approved.

On the basis of the record, the application is approved for 
t h e reasons summarized above. The transaction shall not be consummated 
( Q) before the thirtieth calendar day following the effective date of

this Order, unless such period ie extended for good cause by the Board,

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF GOVERNORS MITCHELL AND BRIMMER 
We dissent from the majority's approval of the acquisition of 
Bank by Applicant. In cur view, the anticompetitive effects that will 
result from the proposed acquisition are not outweighed by the con-
venience and needs consequences of the community to be served. 
We believe the majority erred in not giving consideration to 
4,1 
6 impact this acquisition would have upon a sub-market, the greater 
P°nipano Beach area. 
The Board has previously focused its attention on 
t h e competitive effects in a portion of the relevant market area when 
4,1 
e Applicant was already strongly established and a dominant competi-
t i ve force,, (See the Board's Order in the matter of First at Orlando 
CorPoration, Orlando, Florida, to acquire Citrus First National Bank at 
leesburg, Leesburg, Florida, 59 Federal Reserve Bulletin 302.) The 
heater Pompano Beach area is already highly concentrated. Banking is 
minated by two banking organizations that currently have their only 
8ubsidtaries in this area. Applicant, with three banks, controls 
*8.07 p e r c e n t o f t h e a r e a deposits, and the other holding company, 
W i th four banks, controls 62.11 per cent. Approval of this application 
w°uld result in even greater concentration by increasing the total per-
cetitage of the area's deposits for these two banking organizations to 
1/ 
Sea I?6 w o u l d d e f l n e the greater Pompano Beach area to include Pompano 
Kan h lighthouse Point, Margate, Coral Springs, Coconut Creek and Sea 
jUar? L a k e s - 
This definition differs from that of the Department of 
De ! c e which included Oakland Park, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, and 
rfield Beach in the greater Pompano Beach area. 

9 7 , 8 1 P e r cent. In addition, the acquisition of Bank will result in 
t h e elimination of competition with the only well-established independent 
bank in the area, 
While Bank has been affiliated with two of Applicant's subsidi-
a r y b a nks through common shareholders and interlocking directors, the 
st°ckholders in each of the two other banks do not hold a sufficiently 
la*ge block to clearly control. Further, the evidence indicates that 
Bank has operated independently of Applicant's control for long periods 
during the history of their affiliation. This is illustrated by the 
f a C t t h a t in 1970 Bank stipulated in an antitrust suit that shareholders 
* APPUcant' s lead bank did not own or control Bank and by the fact 
J.L 
a t when Applicant applied in November 1971 to become a bank holding 
CotnPany with respect to two of its subsidiary banks, it did not include 
atlk in the application. In addition, the actions of Bank suggest that 
it h 
a s operated independently of Applicant's subsidiaries. We conclude 
^ a t the acquisition of Bank by Applicant would eliminate existing 
^petition between Bank and Applicant's subsidiaries, foreclose the 
p0s3ibiiit;y of increased competition between Bank and Applicant in the 
futuro 
remove Bank as a means of entry by an unrepresented banking 
mzation, and further concentrate an already concentrated portion of 
banking market. Therefore, the competitive effects are clearly adverse. 
We further find that considerations of convenience and needs 
f t h e community do not outweigh the adverse competitive effects of the 

_ 3300 
-3-
P'foposal. The proposed acquisition would not result in Bank offering any 
nev; services to the community; only internal efficiencies would accrue to 
e 
Bank, 
Based on all the facts of record, wc believe the application 
should bo denied.

Dear Mr. Morris: 
The Board of Governors took action today to disapprove 
the pending decrease in your Bank's discount rate from 7-1/2 to 
7-1/4 per cent which your board of directors voted to establish 
a t their meeting on October 3, In reaching its decision the Board 
took account of the sizable declines that have occurred recently in 
short-term market interest rates. The Board noted, however, that 
the discount rate was permitted to lag well behind the earlier rise 
such rates and that a natural counterpart of the previous policy 
v'ould be to delay a reduction at this time, particularly since most 
snort-terra rates are still above the discount rate despite their 
^arge recent declines. The Board also concluded that it would not 
a desirable to take an action now which it believed would be inter-
preted under current circumstances as an overt signal of easing in 
the general posture of monetary policy. 
While reaching a decision that differs from that of your 
directors, the Board appreciates having had the benefit: of their 
c°nsidered judgment and has asked me to convey their appreciation. 
Yours sincerely,
