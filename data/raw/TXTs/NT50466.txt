Application for membership. There had been distributed a 
memorandum from the Division of Supervision and Regulation dated 
April 30, 1969, recommending approval of the application for member-
ship in the Federal Reserve System made on behalf of Siesta Key 
Palmer Bank, Sarasota, Florida, a proposed new bank in process of 
organization. There had also been distributed a memorandum from the 
Division of Supervision and Regulation dated May 28, 1969, relating 
to the objections to the establishment of the proposed bank raised 
by two affiliated national banks in Sarasota. 
Following discussion, the application for membership was 
approved unanimously, it being understood that the protesting banks 
would be informed of the basis for the Board's favorable action. A 
copy of the letter sent to the Organization Committee of Siesta Key

Palmer Bank is attached as Item No. 1. Attached as Item No. 2 is a 
copy of the letter sent to the senior officer of the two affiliated 
national banks. 
Marine Corporation. A memorandum from the Division of Super-
vision and Regulation dated May 21, 1969, and other pertinent papers 
had been distributed in connection with an application of The Marine 
Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for permission to acquire shares 
of The First State Bank, West Bend, Wisconsin. 
Following comments by Mr. Lyon, the application was approved 
unanimously, with the understanding that an order and statement 
would be drafted for the Board's consideration. 
Proposal of Western Bancorporation. There had been distrib-
uted a memorandum dated June 2, 1969, from the Legal Division relating 
to the proposed issuance and sale of short-term notes by a proposed 
subsidiary of Western Bancorporation, Los Angeles, California, without 
registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Western Bancorporation 
had submitted the proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
with the request that the staff of the Commission recommend to the 
Commission the issuance of a "no action" letter. Before reaching a 
decision, the SEC staff sought the Board's views. 
It appeared that the notes in question would be issued by a 
wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of Western Bancorporation, and that 
the proceeds would be used to purchase participations in loans made 
by bank subsidiaries of the holding company. The memorandum 

1 8 * ) 
6/3/69 
-4-
connnented on the areas in which questions concerning the proposal 
might arise that were within the jurisdiction of the Board, including 
those having to do with the application of the Bank Holding Company 
Act. Other questions related to the possibility that the proposal 
would be a means of evading the provisions of Regulation D, Reserves 
of Member Banks, and Q, Payment of Interest on Deposits. 
For the reasons set forth in the memorandum, the Legal 
Division suggested that the reply to the SEC simply point out the 
possibility that the proposed arrangement might violate the Bank 
Holding Company Act, and that the SEC might wish to bring that possi-
bility to the attention of Western Bancorporation. A draft letter 
along those lines was attached to the memorandum. 
Following staff comments, Mr. Hexter responded to a number 
of questions from members of the Board who desired to have certain 
points clarified, and there was some discussion whether to include 
reference to possible problems under Regulations D and Q. 
Unanimous approval was then given to the letter to the SEC 
as proposed by the Legal Division. A copy is attached as Item No. 3. 
Solicitation of deposits at foreign branches. There had been 
distributed a memorandum from the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation dated June 2, 1969, recommending that a letter be sent to 
all member banks for the purpose of bringing to their attention the 
Board's view that solicitation or acceptance of deposits of U.S. 
residents at foreign branches for purposes unconnected with foreign 

185)3 
6/3/69 
-5-
or international transactions would be inappropriate, particularly at 
the present time when a restrictive monetary policy was in effect. 
Attached to the memorandum was a draft letter. 
The memorandum referred to a recent newspaper report that cer-
tain member banks were soliciting deposits from U.S. corporations and 
other U.S. residents to be placed in their branches in Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands at rates higher than those currently permis-
sible under Regulation Q. (Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act 
provides that deposits "payable only at an office of a member bank 
located outside of the States of the United States and the District 
of Columbia" are not subject to maximum interest rate limitations 
prescribed by the Board. Also, deposits at such branches would not 
be subject to the requirements of Regulation D, Reserves of Member 
Banks.) However, the memorandum pointed out that it had long been the 
established policy of the System, generally understood by the banks 
and reinforced by System examiners, that the acceptance by foreign 
branches generally of deposits of U.S. residents at rates in excess 
of applicable Regulation Q ceilings would be considered inappropriate 
and in violation of the spirit of Regulation Q. More recently, in 
authorizing the establishment of Nassau branches the Board had con-
ditioned its approval on the understanding that the branches were not 
to be used as a means of shifting deposits from offices in the United 
States. 

1894 
6/3/69

The appropriate Federal Reserve Banks had discussed the sit-
uation with the four U.S. banks having offices in the Virgin Islands 
and had received assurances from the banks involved that they would 
cease soliciting such deposits for their branches and terminate at 
the first opportunity such deposits already accepted. In view of the 
publicity that had been given to these activities, the Division of 
Supervision and Regulation proposed that the contents of the recom-
mended letter reminding member banks of the Board's policy be made 
the subject of a press release. 
At the beginning of today's discussion, Mr. Coyne distributed 
a draft press release. 
Mr. Dahl indicated that the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency would be conducting examinations in Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands in the near future, and apparently would be receptive 
to a request from the Board that special attention be paid to deposits 
originating from the continental United States in the course of those 
examinations. Such a procedure would provide an effective check on 
compliance with the Board's request, and he recommended that an 
appropriate letter be sent to the Comptroller. 
Mr. Shay then stated that there was agreement at staff level 
that the approach recommended by the Division of Supervision and 
Regulation was a good one. Should that fail, however, or should the 
Board prefer, the regulatory approach was also open. He expressed 
the view that under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act there was 

18S0 
6/3/69 
-7-
ample authority for the Board to control rates of interest paid on 
dep osits in foreign branches, as well as to impose reserve requirements 
if desired, since foreign branches were established subject to such 
terms and conditions as the Board might prescribe. 
Governor Robertson agreed with Mr. Shay's interpretation of 
the law, but felt that the preferable course would be to send a letter 
to all member banks. He then made several suggestions, largely of an 
editorial nature, for the purpose of sharpening the letter, and other 
members of the Board expressed agreement with the suggested changes. 
Governor Brimmer stated that since it seemed to him certain 
that the contents of the letter would become known, he would consider 
it appropriate that the letter be released by the Board. He suggested 
that the letter, as revised, would provide the basis for a good press 
release, and there was no objection to such a procedure. 
Governor Brimmer then noted that although First Pennsylvania 
Banking and Trust Company of Philadelphia had agreed not to solicit 
additional deposits of U.S. residents for its subsidiary, Virgin Islands 
National Bank, it apparently wished to retain existing deposits. 
Members of the staff explained the manner in which First 
Pennsylvania's transactions differed from those undertaken by banks 
with branches in the Virgin Islands, noting in particular that the 
deposits in question apparently were of long standing, had not been 
solicited in the present environment in an effort to circumvent the 

-rm 
6/3/69 
-8-
provisions of Regulation Q, and were subject to reserve requirements 
since Virgin Islands National Bank was a member bank. 
Following further discussion, unanimous approval was given 
to a letter to all member banks in the form attached as Item No. 4, 
it being understood that the letter would be released to the press. 
The transmittal of a letter to the Comptroller of the Currency along 
the lines suggested by Mr. Dahl was also approved unanimously. A 
copy of the letter subsequently sent is attached as Item No. 5. 
j 
Salary structures at St. Louis. Unanimous approval was given 
to a Letter to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis approving a 
revision of the employee salary structures applicable to the head 
office and branches. A copy of the letter is attached as Item No. 6. 
The meeting continued from this point with limited staff 
attendance. 
Reimbursement for academic seminar expenses. The Board 
authorized a lump-sum payment of $1,000 to Stanford University to 
cover the estimated cost of services rendered by the University 
through calendar year 1968 in connection with the arranging by 
Profes sor G. L. Bach of the Board's periodic academic seminars as 
i 
recommended in a memorandum from the Division of Research and 
Statistics dated May 23, 1969. The Board also authorized the payment 
of $250 annually, in semi-annual instalments in May and December, for 
I

similar services provided in 1969 and in each ensuing year in which 
such services are provided. 
The meeting then adjourned.

Organization Committee, 
Siesta Key Palmer Bank, 
Sarasota, Florida. 
Gentlemen: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
approves the application made on behalf of Siesta Key Palmer Bank, 
Sarasota, Florida, for stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta, effective if and when the bank opens for business under 
appropriate State authorization, subject to the numbered conditions 
hereinafter set forth, 
1. Such bank at all times shall conduct its business and 
exercise its powers with due regard to the safety of its 
depositors, and except with the permission of the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, such bank 
shall not cause or permit any change to be made in the 
general character of its business or in the scope of the 
corporate powers exercised by it at the time of admission 
to membership. 
2. The net capital and surplus funds of such bank shall be 
adequate in relation to the character and condition of 
its assets and to its deposit liabilities and other cor-
porate responsibilities. 
3. At the time of admission to membership, such bank shall 
have paid-in and unimpaired capital stock of not less 
than $400,000, and other capital funds of not less than 
$200,000. 
In connection with the foregoing conditions of membership, 
particular attention is called to the provisions of the Board's 
Regulation H, regarding membership of State banking institutions in 
the Federal Reserve System, with especial reference to Section 208.7 
thereof. A copy of the regulation is enclosed. 

1859 
Siesta Key Palmer Bank 
-2-
If at any time a change in or amendment to the bank's 
charter is made, the bank should advise the Federal Reserve Bank, 
furnishing copies of any documents involved, in order that it may 
be determined whether such change affects in any way the bank's 
status as a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
Acceptance of the conditions of membership contained in 
this letter should be evidenced by a resolution adopted by the board 
of directors after the bank's Certificate of Authority to Commence 
Business has been issued. The board of directors should also adopt, 
at the same time, a resolution ratifying the action which has been 
taken in the bank's behalf in making application for membership in 
the Federal Reserve System. A certified copy of each resolution, 
together with advice of compliance with the provisions of condition 
numbered 3, should be transmitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta. Arrangements will thereupon be made to accept payment for 
an appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock, to accept the 
deposit of the required reserve balance, and to issue the appropriate 
amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock to the bank. 
The time within which admission to membership in the Federal 
Reserve System in the manner described may be accomplished is limited 
to 6 months from the date of this letter, unless the bank applies to 
the Board and obtains an extension of time. When the Board is advised 
that all of the requirements have been complied with and that the 
appropriate amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock has been issued to 
the bank, the Board will forward to the bank a formal certificate of 
membership in the Federal Reserve System. 
The Board of Governors sincerely hopes that you will find 
membership in the System beneficial and your relations with the 
Reserve Bank pleasant. The officers of the Federal Reserve Bank will 
be glad to assist you in establishing your relationships with the 
Federal Reserve System and at any time to discuss with representatives 
of your bank means for making the services of the System most useful 
to you. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Mr. Gilbert N. Parker, 
Chairman of the Board 
and President, 
National Bank of Sarasota, 
Sarasota, Florida. 33579 
Dear Mr. Parker: 
This is in reference to your letter of May 7, 1969, 
addressed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, concerning 
the application of Siesta Key Palmer Bank, Sarasota, Florida, 
a proposed new bank, for membership in the Federal Reserve 
On the basis of all the evidence before it, including 
the comments contained in your letter of May 7, the Board of 
Governors has approved the application for membership in the 
Federal Reserve System by Siesta Key Palmer Bank. In approving 
this application the Board has concluded as follows: 
1. 
Since Siesta Key is a growing community with a 
population of approximately 9,300, the convenience 
and needs of the community would appear to justify 
the establishment of a new bank. 
2. 
The proposed bank would have satisfactory management, 
adequate capital, and satisfactory earnings prospects 
and growth potential. 
3. 
While the three banks--National Bank of Sarasota, 
Gulf Gate National Bank, and American Bank of 
Sarasota--located on the mainland and near one 
System 

Mr. Gilbert N. Parker 
- 2 
1901 
3. continued 
of the two bridges which provide the only access 
from the mainland to Siesta Key would be affected 
to some extent, no serious loss of deposits is 
anticipated because of the favorable growth of 
the whole area. 
4. 
While the proposed bank will be affiliated with 
the largest bank and fifth largest bank in 
Sarasota, the application involves a new bank 
rather than an existing one and, therefore, there 
will be no immediate increase in banking concen-
tration in the area. 
5. 
The proposed new bank would not be in violation 
of Section 8 of the Clayton Act (U.S.C., Title 15, 
Sec. 19) as amended by the Banking Act of 1935, 
or the Board's Regulation L issued pursuant thereto, 
since the interlocking relationships between 
Palmer First National Bank and Trust Company, 
St. Armands Palmer Bank, and the proposed new 
bank are permitted under exception (4) of 
Section 212.2 (d) of Regulation L and Section 8 (4) 
of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 19 (4)). 
Although the above conclusions are not in accord with 
those expressed in your letter of May 7, 1969, the Board appreciates 
having had the benefit of your views in this matter. 
Very truly yours, 
(Signed) Robert P. Forrestal 
Robert P. Forrestal, 
Assistant Secretary.

Mr. Charles E. Shreve, Director, 
Division of Corporation Finance, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Washington, D. C. 
20549 
Dear Mr. Shreve: 
This is in response to your letter of May 16 relating to a 
request, on behalf of Western Bancorporation ("WB"), that the staff of 
the Commission agree to recommend no action to the Commission with re-
spect to a proposed issuance and sale of short-term notes without 
registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The purpose of your 
letter was to give us an opportunity to evaluate the transactions pro-
posed in relation to the Federal banking laws and to comment thereon 
before the Commission's staff takes any action on the proposal. 
The notes in question are to be issued by a wholly-owned non-
bank subsidiary of WB and guaranteed by WB. The proceeds are to be 
used to purchase participations in loans made by bank subsidiaries of 
WB. WB is a bank holding company subject to the provisions of the Bank 
Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq.). 
Section 4(a) of said Act (12 U.S.C. 1843) generally forbids 
a bank holding company (1) to acquire "any voting shares of any 
company which is not a bank", or (2) to "engage in any business other 
than that of banking or of managing or controlling banks or of furnish-
ing services to or performing services for any bank of which it owns 
or controls 25 per centum or more of the voting shares." 
Section 4(c) prescribes a number of exceptions to the general 
prohibition against acquisition of nonbank stock, but it is not apparent 
to us that any of these exceptions would apply to the proposed acquisi-
tion by WB of the stock of the corporation that is to issue the notes 
and invest the proceeds thereof. Another question is whether, by 
engaging in the practice of guaranteeing the notes of its subsidiary, 
WB would be engaging in a business other than those enumerated as 
permissible in the above-quoted portion of section 4(a). 

Mr. Charles E. Shreve 
- 2 -
1903 
You may wish to direct the attention of Western Bancorporation 
to the existence of these questions, in order to give it an opportunity 
to consider them and to discuss them with the Board's staff. The same 
action might be taken, if you deem it appropriate, in the case of other 
corporations, subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, that propose to 
adopt similar practices. 
Sincerely, 
(signed) David B. Hexter

June 3, 1969. 
Dear Sir: 
Under Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, deposits payable 
only at a branch of a member bank located outside of the States of the 
United States and the District of Columbia are exempt from any limita-
tions on rates of interest prescribed in Section 19 and Regulation Q. 
Also, deposits at such branches are not subject to the reserve 
requirements of Regulation D. The general purpose of these exemptions 
is to allow foreign branches of U.S. banks to compete abroad with 
foreign banks. In these circumstances, it has long been and continues 
to be the policy of the Federal Reserve System to discourage deposits 
by United States residents at foreign branches of United States banks 
unless such deposits have been placed to serve a definite, necessary 
purpose outside the United States. 
Recently, in granting its approval under Section 25 of the 
Federal Reserve Act for the establishment of branch facilities in the 
Bahama Islands, the Board indicated that its approval was subject to 
the understanding, among others, that the banks were to conduct operations 
of the branches for the purpose of developing new international business, 
and not as a means of shifting deposits to such branches from offices 
in the United States or for obtaining deposits that would otherwise 
be placed in the United States. 
The principle enunciated in connection with the Bahama branches 
applies to the operations of all foreign branches of member banks. In 
the Board's opinion, the solicitation or acceptance of deposits at 
foreign branches for purposes unconnected with foreign or international 
transactions is particularly inappropriate at the present time, when a 
restrictive monetary policy is in effect. 
Sincerely yours,

The Honorable William B. Camp, 
Comptroller of the Currency, 
Department of the Treasury, 
Washington, D. C. 20220 
Dear Bill: 
The Board recently became aware that certain member banks 
had begun to solicit deposits from United States corporations and 
other United States residents to be placed in their branches in 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands at rates higher than those cur-
rently permissible under Regulation Q. The Board viewed this practice 
as a clear attempt to circumvent the provisions of its Regulations D 
and Q in order to obtain funds under current restrictive monetary 
conditions. The banks involved were contacted and have agreed to 
cease soliciting such deposits for their branches and to terminate 
such deposits as have already been accepted at the first opportunity. 
In recognition of the possibility that the provisions of 
Regulations D and Q could be deliberately avoided through foreign 
branches, it has been an established policy of the System to dis-
courage the acceptance of deposits of United States residents at 
foreign branches of member banks, unless those deposits were placed 
to serve legitimate needs abroad. Because of the recent experience, 
a letter has been sent to all member banks with foreign branches to 
remind them of this Board policy. A copy of the letter is enclosed 
for your information. 
The Board understands that in the very near future your 
Office will be conducting examinations in Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, that will include the branches of The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(National Association), First National City Bank, Bank of America 
National Trust and Savings Association, and also the Virgin Islands 
National Bank. In view of the Board's concern expressed in the en-
closed letter, it would be appreciated if during those examinations 
special scrutiny were given to deposits in those offices originating

The Honorable William B. Camp

from the continental United States. The Board would be grateful 
if it were furnished full information regarding the nature and ex-
tent of such deposits, including rates paid and maturities, and 
particularly whether any such deposits solicited for the branches 
have been terminated or are being run off. Any similar information 
that might feasibly be developed on deposits originating from other 
nonlocal sources and which appear to have been diverted to these 
branches would also be of interest to the Board. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. McC. Martin, Jr.
